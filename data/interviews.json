EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT; THERE IS NO NEED TO CATER TO OTHERS. IN TODAY&#39;S FLEETING WORLD, RICK OWENS, WHO WAS INITIALLY SEEN AS A FREAK, HAS BECOME THE FASHION INDUSTRY&#39;S MOST BELOVED AND TIMELESS DESIGNER. IN OCTOBER, WHILE WAITING FOR RICK OWENS&#39;S REPLY, I LEARNED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, WERE VISITING TOKYO AND SEOUL. THEY HOSTED A RAVE IN TOKYO WITH PERFORMANCES BY DJ YOUSUKE YUKIMATSU, RYOJI IKEDA, AND THE FECAL MATTER DUO... IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAVE, MICHÈLE LAMY RODE A WHITE HORSE LIKE A PRIESTESS, WITH RICK OWENS WALKING BESIDE HER IN KISS BOOTS AND CALMLY HOLDING THE HORSE. A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT CAPTURED THE UNUSUAL SIGHT DURING THE DARK PARTY. THAT NIGHT, ALL THE GUESTS WORE RICK OWENS&#39;S CLOTHES FROM HEAD TO TOE (THE NEW YORK TIMES ONCE DESCRIBED THEM AS SOME KIND OF ALIEN), AND WE’RE ONCE AGAIN SURRENDERED TO THE LORD OF DARKNESS FOREVER. FOR RICK OWENS&#39;S FOLLOWERS, HE IS FAR MORE THAN FASHION; IT IS BELIEF. ASIDE FROM FASHION OR RUNWAY SHOWS. THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THING ABOUT RICK OWENS IS THAT HE HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONG SENSE OF BELONGING FOR NICHE, NON-MAINSTREAM, HETEROGENEOUS, AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS. HE SAID, &quot;TELLING PEOPLE THAT &#39;THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE CHOICES&#39; HAS ALWAYS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MY DESIGN PROCESS. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE BEAUTIFUL ACCORDING TO TYPICAL NORMS. AFTER ALL, THE STANDARD OF BEAUTY IS A BIT CRUEL AND NARROW.” HERE, PEOPLE CAN TAKE OFF THEIR DISGUISES OR EVEN WEAR ARMOR. RICK ACCEPTS THEM FOR THEMSELVES AND THE APPEARANCE THEY WANT TO PROJECT - EVEN IF IT IS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE PUBLIC, IT IS STILL REAL AND MOVING. AN OUTLIER BORN IN A TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC FAMILY RICK OWENS WAS BORN A DEVIANT IN A HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC FAMILY IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA. HIS FATHER WAS A SOCIAL WORKER, AND HIS MOTHER WAS A TEACHER. HE ONCE DESCRIBED HIS CHILDHOOD, SAYING: &quot;AS A CALIFORNIA BOY, I WAS VERY SENSITIVE AND FEMININE.&quot; NON-TRADITIONAL AND GAY, EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM SEEMED TO BE A SIN IN THIS FAMILY. HIS FATHER TRIED TO KEEP HIM AT HOME WITHOUT TELEVISION OR METAL MUSIC; NO ADULTS WOULD LISTEN. &quot;I WAS FORCED TO GIVE IN AND PRETEND TO BE MYSELF IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE WAY. I TOLD MYSELF THAT I HAD TO BECOME MANLY,” HE SAID. “YOU HAVE TO TOUGHEN UP.&quot; AS A CHILD, RICK ACCUMULATED REBELLIOUS ANGER TOWARD THE WORLD AND WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE WORLD AROUND HIM AND HIS EXTREMELY CONTROLLING FATHER. HIS DEPRESSION SEEMED TO FIND AN OUTLET AFTER HE WENT TO LOS ANGELES TO ATTEND OTIS ART HIGH SCHOOL. &quot;AS SOON AS I ENTERED AN ART SCHOOL IN A BIG CITY, I BECAME EVEN MORE CONFIDENT.&quot; HE ADMIRED ARTISTS SUCH AS JOSEPH BEUYS AND JULIAN SCHNABEL. HE STUDIED PAINTING AND, LATER, THOUGHT HE WAS NOT TALENTED ENOUGH AND SWITCHED TO ENTER A TRADE SCHOOL TO LEARN PATTERN AND GARMENT MAKING. AFTER GRADUATION, HE JOINED A HIGH-END IMITATION CLOTHING COMPANY AND COPIED BIG-NAME DESIGNS ALL DAY. AFTER GETTING OFF WORK, HE DRANK, TOOK DRUGS, AND HAD SEX IN BDSM BARS, LEADING A RIDICULOUS LIFE. HE ONCE EXPLAINED: &quot;TO PUT IT SIMPLY, IT MEANS WANDERING ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY, A FRINGE WORLD BASED ON THE LOWEST SENSES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS FULL OF AIDS, DRUGS, AND ALL KINDS OF DANGERS.&quot; &quot;THE REASON WHY I REMEMBER IT SO CLEARLY IS BECAUSE I ENJOYED THIS NEAR-DEATH LIFESTYLE...&quot; HOWEVER, IN THESE VIOLENT AND DECADENT DAYS, RICK OWENS UNEXPECTEDLY MET THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE, MUSE, AND BUSINESS PARTNER, A WOMAN HE WAS WILLING TO BE BURIED WITH-- MICHÈLE LAMY. BEFORE HE MET MICHÈLE LAMY, WHO WAS 18 YEARS OLDER, RICK ONLY HAD BOYFRIENDS. THROUGH HIS THEN-BOYFRIEND (DRAMATICALLY, WHO WAS ALSO NAMED RICK), HE WENT TO WORK FOR MICHÈLE LAMY&#39;S CLOTHING BRAND. NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE A NEW JOB, A NEW LOVER, AND A COMPATIBLE COUPLE. HE MOVED ON TO FOUNDING A BRAND UNDER HIS NAME IN 1994. YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY. THE TORCH THAT BURNS THE FASHION APOCALYPSE INITIALLY, RICK OWENS WAS SPONSORED BY VOGUE FOR HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE 2002 SPRING/SUMMER NEW YORK FASHION WEEK DUE TO THE APPRECIATION OF ANNA WINTOUR. HOWEVER, THE INDUSTRY REGARDED THIS OIL-STAINED, UNDERGROUND DARK AESTHETIC AS AN OUTLIER. &quot;IN NEW YORK AT THE TIME, WHAT I WAS DOING WAS MARGINALIZED AND CONSIDERED A FREAK SHOW.&quot; IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR, RICK AND MICHÈLE SETTLED IN PARIS, AND THEN THEY DROPPED THE MOST CRAZY AND DEVASTATING SHOCK BOMB ON THE FASHION INDUSTRY. IMAGINE THE ENERGY OF THE JAPANESE COMIC &quot;AKIRA&quot; THAT TRIGGERED THE TOKYO EXPLOSION. RICK OWENS IS THE AKIRA WHO DESTROYED THE LONELY FASHION APOCALYPSE AND OPENED A NEW WORLD OF UNIQUE AESTHETICS. DURING THE SPRING/SUMMER 2013 MEN&#39;S SHOW, HE LET THE METAL BAND WINNY PUHH HANG FROM THE CEILING TO PLAY; DURING THE SPRING/SUMMER 2014 WOMEN’S SHOW, HE INVITED AN AFRICAN AMERICAN STEP DANCE GROUP (A COMBINATION OF TAP DANCING, CHEERLEADING, AND MILITARY TRAINING) TO THE RUNWAY TO PERFORM AN INTERPRETATION OF WOMEN&#39;S INTIMIDATING STRENGTH AND POWER DANCES. MY FAVORITE AND MOST UNEXPECTED SHOW WAS THE SPRING/SUMMER 2016 SHOW, WHEN TWO FEMALE ATHLETES WERE CARRIED IN POSITIONS INSPIRED BY THE AVANT-GARDE PERFORMANCE ARTIST LEIGH BOWERY AND HIS WIFE, NICOLA BATEMAN. THIS IS A SHOW, A PAGE OF HISTORY, A SHOCKING SPECTACLE. TODAY, RICK OWENS CASTS HIS SPELL AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN PARIS EVERY SEASON. IN RECENT YEARS, HE HAS REFLECTED ON THE TURMOIL OF THE PANDEMIC, WAR, WOMEN&#39;S RIGHTS, AND POLITICAL SITUATION; RICK OWENS HAS USED FASHION TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO EXPRESS HIS URGENCY AND HELPLESSNESS TOWARDS THE REAL WORLD, TRYING TO FIND INNER PEACE. THE INSPIRATION FOR THE FALL/WINTER 2023 WOMEN&#39;S SHOW ORIGINATED FROM THE UKRAINIAN-RUSSIAN WAR. THE MODELS WERE TIED IN DONUT-LIKE DOWN CYLINDERS AND COVERED BY HUGE, OVERSIZED COATS. RICK EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS A KIND OF SOLEMN ELEGANCE, AND I THINK IT IS MORE OF A RESISTANCE AND PROTECTION, BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CORNER OF THE WORLD IS IN DANGER AND LIVE IN FEAR. BRITISH VOGUE CRITIC ANDERS CHRISTIAN MADSEN ONCE COMMENTED: &quot;IN TODAY&#39;S POST-MODERN FASHION WORLD, WEIRDNESS IS INCREASINGLY WITHERING, AND RICK OWENS HAS BECOME THE SAVIOR.&quot; TEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: FASHIONABLE SOLITARY YOU USED TO BE SHY, BUT NOW YOU’VE FULFILLED SUCH AN ECCENTRIC AND COOL LIFE. COULD YOU TELL US WHEN YOU’RE NOT AFRAID OF WHAT OTHERS THINK OF YOU ANYMORE? WEARING RICK OWENS FULFILLS THE BRAVERY FOR ME TO BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS. WHAT ABOUT YOU, WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG ANY ICON WHO INSPIRED YOU LIKE THIS? &quot;I ALWAYS REMEMBER SEEING DAVID BOWIE’S DIAMOND DOGS ALBUM COVER IN A RECORD STORE IN THE LITTLE CONSERVATIVE TOWN I WAS RAISED IN WHEN I WAS AROUND 13 YEARS OLD - IT VALIDATED THE WEIRDNESS AND ALIENATION I FELT AND MADE ME KNOW THERE WAS A PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR ME. I AM NO COMPARISON TO BOWIE, BUT I HOPE I HAVE HELPED OTHERS IN A SIMILAR WAY.&quot; AS A DESIGNER AND A BRAND LEADER, HOW DO YOU LEAD THE ENTIRE TEAM, AND HOW DO YOU LISTEN TO THE IDEAS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION? &quot;I DON’T THINK I AM SUCH A GREAT LISTENER- I DON’T HAVE A DESIGN ROOM OF PEOPLE SUGGESTING THINGS, I PRETTY MUCH KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WANT AND AM JUST LOOKING FOR THE BEST WAY TO GET MY IDEAS EXECUTED. I NEED EFFICIENT TECHNICIANS MORE THAN I NEED IDEAS…THAT BEING SAID, I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO END UP WITH A GROUP OF WILDLY CREATIVE COLLEAGUES THAT INSPIRE ME EVERY DAY AND FILL MY LIFE WITH SUCH GRATITUDE AND QUIET, GENTLE JOY. &quot; WHAT QUALITIES DOES A PERSON POSSESS THAT WOULD ATTRACT YOU TO HAVE THEM JOIN THE RICK OWENS TEAM? COULD YOU INTRODUCE US TO A CURRENT WORK PARTNER OF YOURS WHOM YOU TRUST AND ADMIRE THE MOST? IS THAT TYRONE DYLAN? &quot;I LOVE HAVING PEOPLE AROUND ME THAT HAVE THE PATIENCE TO SEE THINGS THROUGH IN A CAREFUL AND PRECISE WAY, ALLOWING ME TO BE RECKLESS AND IMPRACTICAL. BUT I DO NEED WINDOWS INTO OTHER WORLDS THAT I DON’T NECESSARILY WANT TO COMPLETELY IMMERSE MYSELF IN…….I LOVE HAVING EXPLORERS THAT COME BACK WITH THEIR EXOTIC REPORTS……..” THOM BROWNE&#39;S TEAM IS RENOWNED FOR WEARING THEIR SUIT UNIFORMS, AND HE MENTIONS, &quot;TO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS KNOW WHY THEY ARE WORKING.&quot; ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RICK OWENS TEAM ALWAYS NATURALLY DRESSES LIKE A FAMILY. DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET AND UNDISCLOSED RULES OR COMMONALITIES WITHIN YOUR TEAM? “NO RULES AND NO LIMITS. I ALWAYS WANTED TO SPREAD A MESSAGE OF INCLUSION AND EMBRACING OTHERNESS. THE IRONY IS THAT OUR OTHERNESS CAN SEEM FORBIDDING TO SOME AND MAKE THEM FEEL UNWELCOME….I NEED TO WORK ON ENSURING THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN…..” DO YOU THINK YOU’RE WORTH BEING THE ICON WHOM YOUNG PEOPLE FOLLOW? “I THINK I HAVE POSITIVE VALUES THAT I ENDORSE IN A SOFT WAY. I COULD BE A LOT WORSE.” WHICH BRAND OR DESIGNER IN FASHION WOULD UPSET YOU IF THEY LEFT THE INDUSTRY? “REI KAWAKUBO BALANCES OUT AN INDUSTRY THAT CAN BE VERY CONSERVATIVE….WE NEED A VOICE LIKE HERS TO REMIND US WHAT&#39;S POSSIBLE…..” WHO WOULD BE YOUR IDEAL PARTNER IF YOU COULD FIND A DESIGNER PARTNER TO WORK WITH, JUST LIKE MIUCCIA PRADA AND RAF SIMONS? WHICH FASHION HOUSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK IN? “I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO BE PART OF A TEAM AND NEGOTIATE- I WOULD JUST AUTOMATICALLY BECOME POLITE AND CONCEDE TO ANYTHING RATHER THAN CONTEST IT. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, I AM A LONER AND HAVE LEARNED TO ACCEPT THAT INSTEAD OF FORCING MYSELF TO BE SOMETHING I AM NOT.” IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ABOUT PARIS FASHION WEEK, DANIEL ROSEBERRY ONCE SAID, “FASHION SHOWS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE STUFF, BUT THE TOUCHES OF HEART ARE GETTING LESS AND LESS.” DO YOU AGREE WITH IT? WHAT’S YOUR AUTHENTIC THOUGHT ABOUT NOWADAYS FASHION SHOWS? “I THINK EVERY FASHION SHOW IS VALID IN THEIR OWN WAY…….SOMETIMES THE CYNICAL CALCULATIONS OF FASHION ARE JUST AS THRILLING AS THE MOST AUTHENTIC CREATIVE GESTURES……I FIND A WAY TO ENJOY EVERYTHING, PERVERSE OR GENUINE.” I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE VISITING MICHAEL HEIZER&#39;S LAND ART PIECES. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY RECENT ARTWORKS/ARTISTS THAT HAVE DEEPLY INSPIRED YOU? “I JUST SAW A DONALD JUDD SHOW THAT MADE ME FALL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN- I AM AFRAID I ONLY LIKE DEAD ARTISTS THAT HAVE MAINTAINED A CONSISTENT LEVEL UNTIL THE END- I CAN’T INVEST EMOTIONALLY IN SOMEONE WHOSE QUALITY OF OUTPUT ISN’T GUARANTEED.” WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INSPIRATION OR EMOTIONAL IMPACT FROM YOUR CREATIVE INSPIRATIONS, DO YOU PREFER TO SHARE IT WITH OTHERS IMMEDIATELY OR PROCESS IT ON YOUR OWN? WHAT IS YOUR USUAL METHOD FOR RECORDING OR DOCUMENTING THESE EMOTIONS AND INSPIRATIONS? “I DON’T FALL IN LOVE VERY EASILY- I HAVE FEW COMMITMENTS BUT THEY ARE DEEP AND LONG. AND WHILE MY LIFE IS AN OPEN BOOK, I KEEP A LOT TO MYSELF.” MONCLER + RICK OWENS UNIQUE COLLABORATION RICK OWENS, WHO HAS BEEN VERY RESISTANT TO WORK ON COLLABORATIONS IN THE PAST, HAS BECOME A LOYAL PARTNER OF TOP ITALIAN BRAND MONCLER. THIS SEASON, HE AND MONCLER ONCE AGAIN JOINED HANDS TO CREATE A CAPSULE SERIES. THEY ALSO DESIGNED A SLEEP POD MADE TO ISOLATE ONESELF FROM THE WORLD. IT IS EQUIPPED WITH A BED, OXYGEN REGENERATION DEVICE, AND TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED VENTILATION SYSTEM. HE EXPLAINED: &quot;I WANTED TO CREATE A SOUNDPROOF RETREAT FOR MYSELF. KIND OF LIKE CHRIST’S STONE TOMB OR SLEEPING BEAUTY’S GLASS COFFIN. I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT FOR MYSELF ANYWAY, BUT WHEN MONCLER SUGGESTED A COLLAB, I THOUGHT I WOULD BUILD A COLLECTION AROUND IT.” WHETHER YOU ARE IN A SLEEP POD OR WRAPPED IN ONE OF THE DOWN JACKETS, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN RICK’S VISION—AN ISOLATED AND WARM PLACE. HIS OBSESSION WITH BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE, MODERNIST SCULPTURES, AND FURNITURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONGLY REFLECTED IN HIS CLOTHING. &quot;I HOPE TO BE A SCULPTOR LIKE CONSTANTIN BRÂNCUȘI IN MY NEXT LIFE. BRÂNCUȘI INSPIRES ALL MY CREATIONS.&quot; A MAJOR FEATURE OF THE SERIES IS THE RADIANCE JACKETS MADE IN LIGHT BLACK, EARTHY BROWN, AND GRADIENT NEUTRAL TONES, INJECTED WITH RICK OWENS&#39; UNIQUE STYLE INTO THE MONOTONOUS WINTER DOWN JACKET—A SENSE OF DOOMSDAY TECHNOLOGY. ITEMS INCLUDE BOMBER JACKETS, DOWN JACKETS, LONG DUVET COATS, ELONGATED COATS, SKIRTS, SHORTS, AND TOPS. LONG KNITWEAR OR BRUSHED COTTON TOPS COME WITH SHOULDER BUTTONS AND OPENINGS FOR CUSTOM STYLING—LONG TUNICS, DRESSES, AND SKIRTS IN DENIM. A PULLOVER SCARF, PLUSH BOOTS, AND A RADIANCE-QUILTED BLANKET COMPLETE THE LOOK. TALKING ABOUT HIS CREATIONS IN RECENT SEASONS, INCLUDING THIS MONCLER COLLABORATION, WHICH HAS GRADUALLY BURST OUT FROM ALL BLACK TO MORE COLORS, RICK ONCE AGAIN REITERATED HIS LOVE FOR THE COLOR BLACK: &quot;BLACK CAN HIDE INSECURITIES FOR SOME OF US, I APPRECIATE WEARING BLACK FOR OBSERVING A LITTLE FORMALITY AND QUIET MODESTY- THE WORLD IS A VERY COLORFUL AND CLUTTERED SPACE, WEARING BLACK AND PROVIDING RESPITE FOR THE EYE CAN BE A POLITE GESTURE.” IN 2017, RICK OWENS RECEIVED THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD AT THE CFDA AWARDS CEREMONY, AND HE SAID: &quot;AS A HUMAN BEING, THE MOST BASIC NEED IS TO BE HEARD. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL HEARD.&quot; I THOUGHT THIS WAS WHAT COUNTLESS PEOPLE WANTED TO SAY TO HIM SINCE COUNTLESS BROKEN SOULS WHO WERE MARGINALIZED IN THE PAST HAD THE COURAGE TO DREAM.

IN L.A., WHERE IT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANYWHERE WITHOUT A CAR, I RENTED A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR AND CHANGED IT EVERY MONTH. BEFORE THAT, I HAD A BLACK T-TOP V8 CAMARO. I&#39;LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE GLORY OF SPEEDING DOWN THE FREEWAY IN THAT CAR, THE TOP OFF, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND CRESTING THE MOUNTAINS AND SEEING THE LIGHTS OF L.A. I HAD KISS BLASTING ON THE STEREO, A BOTTLE OF VODKA BETWEEN MY LEGS, AND I WAS IMMORTAL. THAT WAS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.&nbsp; IN PARIS, EVERY PLACE I NEED TO GET TO IS A CLOSE METRO RIDE OR WALK. GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT SUBWAYS, THE METRO HOLDS GREAT URBAN NOVELTY FOR ME. BUT WHEN I NEED TO GET SOMEWHERE, I USE A DRIVER, USUALLY KEVIN OR GUY.&nbsp; WHEN I&#39;M TRAVELING, I DEFINITELY HIRE A DRIVER SO I CAN SEE THE MOST THE FASTEST.&nbsp; I REALLY HAVE NO INTEREST IN DRIVING ANY MORE, BUT IF I WAS GOING TO ALLOW MYSELF THE LUXURY OF A FULL-TIME CAR AND DRIVER, I&#39;D DEFINITELY GET A DARK METALLIC GREY CITROEN DS, WITH DARK GREY FELTED CASHMERE UPHOLSTERY AND A BAD-ASS STEREO WITH HARDCORE SOUNDPROOFING. THESE DAYS, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MONTSERRAT CABALLE PLAYING.

WHAT IS YOUR OWN FIRST-HAND STORY ABOUT THIS, ABOUT YOUR ROOTS AS A DESIGNER?&nbsp; WELL ACTUALLY, WAL-MART DIDN&rsquo;T EXIST THEN AND I DIDN&rsquo;T EVEN HAVE THE IMAGINATION TO DREAM OF A DECADENT LIFE IN PARIS.

WHO DOESN&rsquo;T LOVE CRYSTAL METH SELF-INDULGENT MELODRAMA?&nbsp; WHAT EVENTS LEAD YOU TO BECOME PART OF THE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD HUSTLER BAR WORLD, AS YOU DESCRIBED IT IN LEE CARTER&rsquo;S INTERVIEW WITH YOU IN HINT MAGAZINE?&nbsp; I DON&rsquo;T REMEMBER ANY SERIES OF EVENTS. JUST AN ENTHUSIASTIC LEAP.&nbsp; THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAD WITH WORKING FOR KNOCK-OFF COMPANIES IN LA, WAS IT SIGNIFICANT?&nbsp; ITS ONLY SIGNIFICANCE WAS IN REPETITION AND TRAINING. I DID IT BECAUSE I KNEW I COULD ALWAYS FIND A JOB WITH AN EMPLOYABLE SKILL. I DON&rsquo;T REMEMBER BEING VERY AMBITIOUS THEN.&nbsp; CAN YOU POINT OUT THINGS, RELATIONSHIPS, PEOPLE AND/OR EVENTS IN YOUR LIFE THAT HAVE SHAPED YOUR AESTHETICS?&nbsp; ONE OF THE THINGS I REMEMBER IS FEELING A SIGH OF RELIEF ON SEEING &rdquo;PINK FLAMINGOS.&rdquo; IT WAS THE CHEERY F CK-YOU TO CONVENTIONALITY I&rsquo;D BEEN WAITING FOR. IT WAS A CELEBRATION OF SELF-INVENTION. FOOTNOTE: I JUST FOUND OUT THAT LARRY LEGASPI, WHO DID THE COSTUMES FOR LABELLE, ALSO DID THE COSTUMES FOR KISS AND THEN DIVINE&rsquo;S COSTUMES FOR THE PLAY &rdquo;PORK&rdquo;! AND YET THERE&rsquo;S HARDLY ANY DOCUMENTATION ON LARRY LEGASPI! I&rsquo;M GONNA TALK ABOUT HIM EVERY CHANCE I GET.&nbsp; YOU HAVE CALLED YOUR STYLE &rdquo;MORE CAMP THAN GOTH.&rdquo; HOW IS IT MORE CAMP THAN GOTH?&nbsp; &rsquo;CAUSE IT&rsquo;S WITH A LOVING WINK.&nbsp; WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR BREAKTHROUGH?&nbsp; BEING RECOGNIZED BY AMERICAN VOGUE PROBABLY GAVE ME THE CREDIBILITY THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. AT THE TIME, THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AMERICAN DESIGNERS TO PROMOTE AND SPONSORED MY FIRST SHOW. I WAS JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED DECLINING. HOW WOULD MY NARROW AESTHETIC SURVIVE THE SPOTLIGHT OF A RUNWAY FOR MORE THAT A COUPLE OF SEASONS? I MIGHT RISK OVEREXPOSING A LIMITED STORY AND BURNING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT COULD EXTEND LONGER QUIETLY. BUT THEN I GOT OVER MYSELF AND THOUGHT &ldquo;F CK IT. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.&rdquo;&nbsp; WHAT&rsquo;S IT LIKE TO BE AN EXPAT AMERICAN IN PARIS? WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR LIFE LIKE TODAY? AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PARISIAN FASHION WORLD?&nbsp; I WAS SO HORRIFIED THAT I DIDN&rsquo;T PICK UP FRENCH EASILY THAT I JUST NEVER TRIED AGAIN. I LOVE FEELING LIKE A VISITOR EVEN THOUGH I&rsquo;VE BEEN HERE SIX YEARS NOW. I LIVE IN A VERY LOVELY BUBBLE AND APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. LIKE ANY PLACE I&rsquo;VE LIVED, I&rsquo;VE REDUCED IT TO A TRIANGLE BETWEEN MY STUDIO/HOME, THE GYM AND A FEW NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANTS. BUT MY WALK TO THE GYM TAKES ME THROUGH PLACE DE LA CONCORDE, THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES AND PALAIS ROYAL NOW.&nbsp; IT&rsquo;S OFTEN SAID THAT YOU HAVE A CULT FOLLOWING. WHAT KIND OF ATTENTION DO YOU GET FROM YOUR FANS, AND WHAT KIND OF CONTACT DO YOU HAVE WITH THEM? HAVE THERE BEEN INCIDENTS, GOOD AND/OR BAD?&nbsp; SORRY TO DISAPPOINT, BUT NOTHING SIGNIFICANT, ALTHOUGH IT DOES REMIND ME OF A KIND OF UNRELATED STORY. SOMEONE INTRODUCED ME TO SIOUXIE SIOUX A FEW YEARS AGO AND SHE SAID, &ldquo;OH YEAH, I REMEMBER SEEING YOU IN THE LOUNGE AT LAX. I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ITALIAN PORN STAR.&rdquo; I&rsquo;LL REMEMBER THAT LINE UNTIL THE DAY I DIE.&nbsp; SEVERAL CELEBRITIES HAVE WORN YOUR CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THIS? DO YOU HAVE ANY DREAM CLIENT(S)?&nbsp; CELEBRITIES HAVE ONE OF EVERYTHING, SO IF YOU&rsquo;RE IN BUSINESS LONG ENOUGH, SOMEONES GOING TO WEAR ONE OF YOUR THINGS IN A PICTURE. I&rsquo;M GLAD WHEN ANYONE BUYS MY CLOTHES.&nbsp; ABOUT ONE OF THE EDWARD STEICHEN IMAGES IN YOUR BOOK &ldquo;L&rsquo;AI-JE BIEN DESCENDU?&rdquo; YOU SAID: &rdquo;IT&#39;S ONE OF MY STANDARDS. IT&#39;S WHAT I WANT LIFE TO BE.&rdquo; WHICH PHOTOGRAPH WAS IT? AND IN WHAT WAY IS IT HOW YOU WANT LIFE TO BE? HOW DO YOU WANT LIFE TO BE?&nbsp; IT&rsquo;S A PICTURE OF AN OPERA SET FROM THE &#39;30S THAT I TORE OUT OF A NEWSPAPER ONCE AND COULD NEVER FIND AGAIN. IT&rsquo;S A BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF A MOMENT OF SPIRITUAL ASCENSION DURING A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IN THE OPERA. THE SET IS MONUMENTAL AND VAGUELY BAUHAUS/DECO. THERE&rsquo;S A FIGURE THAT&rsquo;S MOVING FROM SPIRITUAL PURSUIT TO SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL RESOLUTION. I&rsquo;M NOT SPIRITUAL AT ALL, BUT THERE&#39;S SOMETHING TOUCHING ABOUT THAT MOMENT. AND THE MOOD OF THE PICTURE IS QUIET, DIGNIFIED AND HEROIC.&nbsp; THE FURNITURE LINE: WHAT ARE THE FUTURE PLANS, IN TERMS OF DESIGN AND COLLECTIONS?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M WORKING ON DOING SOME THINGS IN PATE DE VERRE. I&rsquo;LL KEEP DOING FURNITURE FOREVER, WHETHER ANYBODY&rsquo;S PAYING ATTENTION OR NOT.&nbsp; YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT TAKING A STEP FURTHER TOWARDS BUILDINGS/ARCHITECTURE. WHAT WOULD THE DREAM PROJECT BE?&nbsp; ARCHITECTURE SOUNDS KIND OF LOFTY AND I&rsquo;M KIND OF BUSY. SUFFICE TO SAY THAT I LIKE PLAYING WITH VOLUMES.&nbsp; IN WHAT WAY DO YOU IDENTIFY WITH YOUR PROT&Eacute;G&Eacute; GARETH PUGH, AND WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT HIS PARIS DEBUT?&nbsp; I LOVE THAT HE&rsquo;S A FOCUSED TECHNICIAN, FOLLOWING HIS VISION NO MATTER WHAT.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU GET INSPIRED BY, AT THIS MOMENT?&nbsp; -GRACE JONES&rsquo;S &quot;CORPORATE CANNIBAL&quot; VIDEO -TINA TURNER SINGING &rdquo;ACID QUEEN&rdquo; IN THE MOVIE &rdquo;TOMMY&rdquo; -ARCHITECTURE OF CLAUDE PARENT -ARTIST ANDREI MOLODKIN -LARRY F CKING LEGASPI!

HIGH ABOVE, A LARGE BIRD, POSSIBLY A KITE OR A HAWK, SOARED GRACEFULLY AS IF TO WELCOME RICK OWENS AND MICHÈLE LAMY ON THEIR FIRST VISIT TO JAPAN IN 20 YEARS. BEFORE THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, IN THE FALL OF 2019, HIROSHI SUGIMOTO&#39;S DIRECTED THE BALLET &quot;AT THE HAWK&#39;S WELL&quot;, WHICH ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESS AT THE PARIS OPERA HOUSE. HERE, YEARS AFTER THAT COLLABORATION, THE REUNION TOOK PLACE BETWEEN RICK OWENS, WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTUMES, HAIR, AND MAKEUP; RYOJI IKEDA, WHO TOOK CHARGE OF THE MUSIC AND SPATIAL DIRECTION; AND HIROSHI SUGIMOTO, THE FOUNDER OF ENOURA OBSERVATORY. AMIDST THE ENOURA OBSERVATORY, WHERE THE STONE STAGE INTERTWINES WITH THE OPTICAL GLASS STAGE, BESIDE THE WELL, AND ALONG THE TUNNEL&#39;S WHISPER, THEIR DIALOGUE COMMENCED—A JOURNEY THAT EFFORTLESSLY SOARED BEYOND THE CONFINES OF FASHION AND ART, EMBRACED BY ENOURA&#39;S SERENE NATURE. THEIR DISCOURSE NATURALLY VENTURED INTO PROFOUND PHILOSOPHICAL TERRAINS BY ECHOING THE THEMES OF THE OPERA HOUSE&#39;S DANCE DRAMA, MUSINGS ON LIFE AND DEATH, AND MEMENTO MORI, SPACE, AND TIME. THIS CONVERSATION WAS CAPTURED IN A CAVERN&#39;S EMBRACE, WITHIN THE TUNNEL — A REALM OF INTROSPECTION AND RESONANCE. FIRSTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT YOUR NEW VISUAL BOOK &quot;MORE RICK OWENS BY DANIELLE LEVITT&quot; PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI. YOUR COLLABORATION WITH DANIELLE BEGAN IN 2014. WHAT DO YOU FIND SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR OWN WORK IN THE PHOTOGRAPHY BY DANIELLE? RICK OWENS (REFERRED TO AS HEREAFTER RICK): WELL, OUR COLLECTION IS AN EVOLUTION OF THE COLLECTION BEFORE IT. SO I WILL STUDY IMAGERY AND DECIDE WHAT I NEED TO DO NEXT IN RELATION TO THAT. I&#39;M SURE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING SUBLIMINAL WHEN I LOOK AT THE WORKS. SHE SHOWS MY WORK IN A DYNAMIC WAY; IT&#39;S NOT OVERTLY SEXUALIZED OR OVERTLY MELODRAMATIZED. THERE IS A LIFE TO IT. THAT IS WHAT I EXPECT FROM DANIELLE&#39;S WORK, WHICH MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IT’S IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT. IT PUTS ME IN THE RIGHT MOOD TO MOVE FORWARD. IT&#39;S BEEN A WHILE SINCE YOUR LAST VISIT TO JAPAN. WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO ENOURA OBSERVATORY THIS TIME? RICK: WELL, YOU KNOW, WE&#39;RE HERE IN JAPAN TO DO A BOOK SIGNING OF MY NEW RIZZOLI BOOK. THE OTHER TIME I WAS HERE WAS 20 YEARS AGO. IT WAS TIME TO COME BACK AND SAY HELLO TO MY JAPANESE FRIENDS. MICHÈLE AND I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT ENOURA OBSERVATORY SINCE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE. WE DECIDED TO STAY WITH OUR FRIENDS RYOJI AND HIROSHI. NOW THAT WE ARE, WE’RE OVERWHELMED. IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. HIROSHI SUGIMOTO (REFERRED TO AS &quot;HIROSHI&quot; HEREAFTER): WHAT I SHOWED RICK EARLIER WAS ONLY HALF OF IT. ACTUALLY, IF YOU GO FURTHER DOWN FROM HERE, THERE&#39;S ANOTHER HALF. THERE IS A &quot;FOSSIL CAVE&quot; WHERE I DISPLAY MY FOSSIL COLLECTION. IT HAS TRILOBITES, AMMONITES, AND OTHER THINGS FROM OVER 200 MILLION YEARS AGO. IF YOU LIKE, I CAN GIVE YOU A TOUR THERE AFTER THIS. RICK: I&#39;D LOVE TO GO, SERIOUSLY. ANYWAY, MICHÈLE AND I WERE REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY. I&#39;M CURIOUS ABOUT THE SOUND IN THIS CAVE, AND I LOVE THE STONES HERE. THERE ARE SO MANY STONES THAT WE LOVE, AND THERE ARE ALSO CAVES AND TUNNELS. I LOVE IT. HIROSHI: I LOVE STONES. WE ALL LOVE STONES. YOU COULD SAY STONE FETISHIST (LAUGHS). WHEN I WAS BUILDING ENOURA OBSERVATORY, I COLLECTED STONES FROM VARIOUS PLACES. THERE ARE STONES THAT ARE OVER 1,000 YEARS OLD. STONES FROM THE TENPYO ERA, STONES FROM THE ASUKA ERA, STONES THAT WERE USED IN THE EDO CASTLE OF TOKYO, STONES USED IN OLD FRENCH STAIRCASES, AND MANY MORE. IT WAS A STRANGE FATE, OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY KARMA. STONES GATHERED AROUND ME. RICK: YOU ARE A TRUE STONE FETISHIST (LAUGHS). IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ETERNAL. WE ALL FEEL THE CONNECTION, OR WE WANT TO FEEL THE CONNECTION OR ENJOY THE CONNECTION WITH THE ETERNAL. HIROSHI: YEAH, THE STONE IS THE LEAST CHANGING MATERIAL OVER TIME. I MEAN, OUR SOCIETY - HUMAN LIFE IS SO SHORT AND FRAGILE. I WANTED TO USE THESE STONES FOR MY SPACE. I WANTED THIS OBSERVATORY MADE OF STONES TO BECOME A RUIN A THOUSAND OR MAYBE FIVE THOUSAND YEARS LATER. HOPEFULLY LIKE THE EGYPTIAN PIECES (LAUGHS). SPEAKING OF EGYPT, ACCORDING TO HIROSHI’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY &quot;KAGEROU NIKKI (DIARY OF AN OLD MAN IN THE SHADOWS)&quot; (2022), YOU HAVE BEEN ACTIVE AS AN ANTIQUE ART DEALER SINCE 1979 AND LATER BECAME A COLLECTOR. ON THE OTHER HAND, RICK ALSO HAS BEEN COLLECTING ART PIECES. IN A YOUTUBE VIDEO, YOU ALSO SHOWED A DARK-COLORED EGYPTIAN STONE SARCOPHAGUS IN YOUR CONCORDIA HOUSE IN ITALY. RICK: YES. I HAVE A SARCOPHAGUS IN MY HOUSE. I ALSO HAVE A HUMAN SKULL IN MY CONCORDIA HOUSE, IN THE LIDO HOUSE, AND I HAVE A HUMAN SKULL IN PARIS. HIROSHI: I DO OWN A SMALL MUMMY OF A CAT. IT&#39;S A MUMMY ENCLOSED IN A COFFIN, AND THERE&#39;S A PORTRAIT OF A CAT ON IT. IT&#39;S A SMALL AND BEAUTIFUL CAT. RICK: WOW, GREAT. SOMEBODY ONCE ASKED ME, “HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH REMINDERS OF DEATH LIKE THAT AROUND YOU?” AND I SAID, “HOW CAN YOU NOT BE AWARE OF YOURSELF IN THE FACE OF THAT? IT MAKES YOUR OWN INSECURITIES INSIGNIFICANT.” THESE PIECES ARE JUST A REMINDER THAT LIFE IS VERY SHORT, AND THEN ONE DAY, MY SKULL WILL BE ON SOMEBODY ELSE&#39;S DESK, WHICH IS FINE WITH ME. IT&#39;S THE CYCLE OF LIFE. HIROSHI: I LIKE IT. RICK: BUT IT&#39;S ALSO KIND OF… YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER DIED LAST YEAR, AND SHE HAD CANCER THAT CAUSED SO MUCH PAIN. IT WAS SHOCKING HOW MUCH PAIN SHE HAD ENDURED, AND I THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE ENOUGH DRUGS INVENTED TO ELIMINATE ANY PROBLEMS BUT THERE WEREN&#39;T. DOCTORS GAVE HER OPIATES, THEY GAVE HER OXYCODONE, ALL OF THESE DRUGS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER, AND SHE WAS COMPLETELY LUCID, BUT SHE WAS STILL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I WAS SHOCKED. IT ALSO MADE ME REALIZE THAT THERE ARE ALL THESE CRUCIFIXES DISPLAYED IN PEOPLE&#39;S HOUSES IN MEXICO, AND I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT IT WAS JUST A REMINDER OF SPIRITUALITY, BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY SERVES A VERY PRACTICAL PURPOSE. I THINK IT IS TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT SUFFERING IS INEVITABLE. I THINK IT WAS SEEING SOMEBODY SUFFERING ON A CLOCK CROSS EVERY DAY, I THINK IT WAS JUST A DEVICE TO MAKE PEOPLE USED TO THE IDEA THAT SUFFERING IS GOING TO BE THERE. IT&#39;S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF IT HAS TO DO WITH ROCKS OR… OH, SKULLS! THAT’S A REMINDER OF OUR POSITION ON EARTH, WHICH IS NOT THAT POWERFUL. IN 2019, HIROSHI DIRECTED AN UNCONVENTIONAL DRAMA AT THE PARIS OPERA TITLED &quot;AT THE HAWK’S WELL.&quot;, WHICH IS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS IN 1916. HIROSHI INVITED RYOJI TO BE THE SOUND ARCHITECT AND RICK TO BE THE COSTUME DESIGNER. COINCIDENTALLY, THIS PIECE EXPLORED THE THEME OF &quot;MEMENTO MORI.&quot; THE NARRATIVE REVOLVES AROUND AN ELDERLY MAN PATIENTLY WAITING FOR THE IMMORTAL WATER TO EMERGE FROM A WELL. SIMULTANEOUSLY, A YOUNG MAN, DRIVEN BY THE SAME DESIRE FOR IMMORTALITY, AND A HAWK SPIRIT GUARDING THE WELL BECOME CENTRAL FIGURES IN THE STORY. HOW DID THE THREE OF YOU MEET, AND HOW DID YOU COME TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THIS OPERA? RICK: WHICH WAS OUR FIRST TIME TOGETHER? I CAN&#39;T REMEMBER. RYOJI IKEDA (REFERRED TO AS &quot;RYOJI&quot; HEREAFTER): ME NEITHER. BUT, ANYWAY, I GOT CONTACTED BY YOU, NOT BY YOUR TEAM. YOU. RICK: YEAH. I DON&#39;T HAVE PEOPLE FROM MY TEAM CONTACT PEOPLE. I ALWAYS DO IT MYSELF. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT THING OF HAVING MY SECRETARY CALL YOUR SECRETARY, CALL YOUR PRESS OFFICE. I ALWAYS JUST EMAIL PEOPLE MYSELF, AND I ALWAYS STAY DIRECT TO WHOEVER IT IS. SO I KNOW THAT I HAD TO CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY. RYOJI: YEAH, RIGHT. IN PARIS, I HAD A FACE-TO-FACE WITH YOU AND MICHÈLE. I HAVE HAD MANY REQUESTS AND OFFERS FROM OTHER FASHION BRANDS, BUT I COULD NOT REACH THE DESIGNERS DIRECTLY EVERY TIME. I FOUND THAT THEY JUST WANTED TO USE ME. SO, I KEPT SAYING NO TO EVERY OFFER. EXCEPT THIS GUY! YOU, RICK. THAT WAS A GREAT ENCOUNTER INDEED. RICK, IF YOU REMEMBER ME, HONESTLY, I DIDN&#39;T KNOW MUCH ABOUT FASHION BACK THEN. I KNEW RICK ONLY BY NAME BUT DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT YOU. BUT YEAH, THEN WE WORKED ON A LOT OF PROJECTS, AND WE&#39;RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING IN TOKYO TOMORROW. RICK: IT WAS GREAT TO MEET YOU. YOU ARE SUPER EASY TOO. YOU&#39;RE VERY ORGANIZED. I LOVE THAT. SO MANY PEOPLE AREN&#39;T ORGANIZED. THEN, WHEN MR. SUGIMOTO ASKED YOU TO DO &quot;AT THE HAWK&#39;S WELL,&quot; YOU INTRODUCED HIM TO RICK. RYOJI: I FELT A SHARED CONTEXT BETWEEN RICK AND HIROSHI. THE COSTUMES OBVIOUSLY HAD TO BE CREATED BY YOU IN MY MIND. I ALSO INTRODUCED HIM TO ALESSIO SILVESTRIN, A CHOREOGRAPHER WELL-VERSED IN JAPANESE NOH TOO. RICK, I WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU&#39;D CONNECT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE PARIS OPERA HOUSE, PARTICULARLY WITH ITS COSTUME DEPARTMENT, WHICH HAS ITS OWN HERITAGE AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT. IT&#39;S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE CONTEXT OF FASHION. AS A RESULT, SOMETHING TRULY AMAZING EMERGED. HIROSHI: WE CREATED SOMETHING TRULY NON-TRIVIAL. RICK: IT WAS FANTASTIC. FOR ME, IT WAS A UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. IT&#39;S QUITE FATEFUL THAT THE TWO OF YOU, BOTH CONSCIOUS OF MEMENTO MORI, CROSSED PATHS. THE AUDIENCE WHO WITNESSED IT WAS INDEED LUCKY, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS DONE RIGHT BEFORE THE CORONA PANDEMIC. WHAT DID YOU DO DURING THE PANDEMIC?&quot; RYOJI: IT WAS FORTUNATE. IT WAS REALLY LAST MINUTE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. SUGIMOTO: YES, INDEED. HONESTLY, I ENJOYED THE PANDEMIC. IT&#39;S QUITE A HUMAN THING, QUITE HUMAN. NO ONE CALLED ME. I FOUND A MOMENT OF SILENCE. ACTUALLY, I HAD A CHANCE TO STUDY CALLIGRAPHY AND TAUGHT MYSELF DURING THE PANDEMIC. AS YOU SEE, SOME OF MY WORKS ARE HERE. I CARVED THEM ON THE STONE MONUMENTS. RYOJI: I REALLY LIKE YOUR &quot;HETA-UMA (SO-AMATEURISH-IT&#39;S-GOOD)&quot; CALLIGRAPHY (LAUGHS). RICK: HAHA. THAT’S VERY GOOD INDEED. I DON&#39;T KNOW ABOUT CALLIGRAPHY VERY MUCH. FOR ME, THE PANDEMIC WAS A GOOD TIME TO LEARN FRENCH OR ITALIAN, BUT I DIDN&#39;T. INSTEAD, I WENT TO MY LIBRARY. IT WAS A PERIOD WHERE MICHÈLE AND I WOULD LAY UNDER OUR TREES ON OUR TERRACE, AND WE JUST READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT WE HAD BEEN COLLECTING AND PLANNING TO READ BUT JUST NEVER DID. AND THIS TIME, I THOUGHT IT WAS A TIME TO STUDY TO ABSORB INFORMATION UNTIL WE WERE READY TO GO OUT AND PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD AGAIN. IT WAS STUNNING, I THINK, BUT THEN AS SOON AS WE COULD, I WENT BACK TO THE FACTORY IN CONCORDIA BECAUSE THAT WAS OUR SURVIVAL, OUR CENTER OF SURVIVAL, AND IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE EVERYONE THERE. OUR TEAM WAS UNITED, AND WE HAD TO RECALIBRATE OUR BUSINESS SINCE THINGS HAD CHANGED, AND WE HAD CHANGED TOO. WE DECIDED TO DO RUNWAY SHOWS AS SOON AS WE COULD, AND WE DID THEM WITHOUT AN AUDIENCE IN VENICE. WE DID OUR VERY BEST IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY. WE HAD TO SHOW OUR RESISTANCE AND PRESENT THE VERY BEST WE COULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS ALSO A CHANCE TO TRY WORKING IN A DIFFERENT WAY, WHICH WAS VERY BONDING, AND OUR GROUP UNITED IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WAY, IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. EXPLORED BY MR. SUGIMOTO, THE ENOURA OBSERVATORY WAS CONSTRUCTED USING TRADITIONAL, ANCIENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURAL TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY RARE AND OBSOLETE. SPEAKING OF ARTISANS, RICK OWENS ALSO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH JAPANESE ARTISANS. HOW DO YOU PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ITALIAN ARTISANS AND JAPANESE ARTISANS? DID YOU FIND THEM BY YOURSELF? RICK: YES. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DENIM CAPSULE THAT IS MADE JUST IN JAPAN. IF I WERE TO LOOK FOR THEM JUST BY MYSELF, IT WOULD TAKE A MILLION YEARS (LAUGHS). BUT, WE HAVE INQUIRED, AND WE HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE LOOKED FOR US. SO YEAH WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS HERE AND THEY FIGURED IT OUT FOR US. IF I DID IT BY MYSELF, IT WOULD TAKE MILLION YEARS (LAUGH). ITALIAN CRAFTSMANSHIP IS MORE OPERATIC. JAPANESE CRAFTSMANSHIP IS MORE EXQUISITE. HIROSHI: (LAUGH) I HEARD THAT YOUR FATHER ALSO HAS A CONNECTION TO JAPAN. HIROSHI: OH, REALLY? RICK: YES. I FORGOT ALL THE DETAILS, BUT HE WAS A MAIL CARRIER ON A US BASE IN JAPAN AT THE TIME, AND HE WAS VERY ENAMORED WITH THE CULTURE. HE WAS ACTUALLY A VERY CONSERVATIVE, VERY STRICT, MORALISTIC MAN, BUT I REMEMBER THAT IN HIS CLOSET, HE HAD AN OLD TRUNK FULL OF KIMONOS, CALLIGRAPHIC SCROLLS, INCENSE, AND PICTURES OF HIM WEARING KIMONO WITH BEAUTIFUL GIRLS THAT HE DATED IN JAPAN (LAUGH). HE HAD ALSO COLLECTED BOOKS OF JAPANESE WATERCOLORS, OLD, OLD ONES. THERE WERE NO EXAMPLES OF THAT KIND OF ART IN OUR WORLD OTHER THAN HIS BOOKS. BECAUSE MY FAMILY LIVED IN A CONSERVATIVE AMERICAN TOWN THAT DIDN&#39;T REALLY HAVE AN ART CULTURE, THOSE BOOKS IN HIS BASEMENT WERE FROM ANOTHER PLANET TO ME. FROM ANOTHER PLANET. SO THAT MADE THEM VERY SUPERNATURAL. I THINK WHAT ALL THREE OF US HERE HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT WE ARE ALL INDEPENDENTS. NOWADAYS, IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT A DESIGNER BECOMES THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF A BIG FASHION HOUSE OR A BRAND IS ACQUIRED BY BIG CONGLOMERATES. I BELIEVE INDEPENDENCE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT RICK OWENS IS ABLE TO UPDATE THE STRONG ENCHANTING AMBIANCE WITHOUT CHANGING IT AROUND. WHAT DO RICK AND SUGIMOTO-SAN THINK ABOUT BEING INDEPENDENT? RICK: WELL, ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT IF THEY COULD AND I HAD THE FORTUNE TO MEET MICHÈLE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE VERY TALENTED PARTNERS WHO ARE MORE TALENTED THAN I AM AT PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF A GOOD BUSINESS, HONESTLY AND WITH A PURE SPIRIT. WE WERE ABLE TO GROW VERY NATURALLY AND ORGANICALLY FROM VERY SMALL AND TAKE OUT WHAT I DID WITHOUT EXPLOITING IT AND PROTECTING IT AS CAREFULLY AS I DID. SO THAT DOESN&#39;T HAPPEN. THAT&#39;S A MIRACLE. THAT&#39;S LIKE A MIRACLE MARRIAGE. MICHÈLE: (FROM THE TOP OF THE CAVE) HEY. YOU SHOULD COME UP HERE. RICK: HAHAHA. SO, MY INDEPENDENCE CAN&#39;T HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY. OH YEAH. SO IT&#39;S JUST LUCK. HIROSHI WELL, INDEPENDENCE…ACTUALLY, MY FIRST CAREER WAS AS A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER&#39;S ASSISTANT, BACK IN THE EARLY 1970S WHEN, AFTER GRADUATING FROM L.A. PHOTOGRAPHY SCHOOL. HOWEVER, I WAS SO SICK OF BEING CONTROLLED BY OTHERS AND WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE, SO I QUICKLY QUIT – IN JUST TWO MONTHS (LAUGHS). AROUND THAT TIME IN 1974, I ENCOUNTERED A WORK BY DONALD JUDD IN THE CITY. IT WAS A PIECE WITH NUMEROUS VENEER BOARDS MOUNTED ON A WALL. SEEING THAT, I WAS OVERWHELMED, THEN THOUGHT TO MYSELF, &quot;YES, I SHOULD TRY LIVING IN THIS WORLD IN MY OWN WAY.&quot; THEN BECAME AN ARTIST. LATER ON, IN 1979, I BEGAN COLLECTING JAPANESE ART PIECES AND, ALONGSIDE MY OWN ARTISTIC WORK, I STARTED A STORE IN NEW YORK CALLED &quot;MINGEI&quot; IN SOHO WHERE I SOLD JAPANESE FOLK CRAFTS. I COLLECTED BUDDHIST ART AND GRADUALLY BEGAN TO GATHER ITEMS RELATED TO SHINTO. INITIALLY, I SOURCED ITEMS FOR CLIENTS, BUT NOW I COLLECT FOR MYSELF. YOU VENTURED INTO THE REALM OF ARCHITECTURE WITH THE 2002 PROJECT OF REBUILDING THE GO&#39;O SHRINE ON NAOSHIMA AND HAVE BEEN DOING COMMISSIONED WORKS AS WELL, HAVEN&#39;T YOU? HIROSHI: THAT PROJECT LED TO OFFERS FOR ARCHITECTURAL WORKS, AND THAT&#39;S HOW I STARTED TAKING ON COMMISSIONED JOBS. IN 2008, I ESTABLISHED “SHINSOKEN - NEW MATERIAL RESEARCH LABORATORY.” DESPITE ITS NAME, IT EXAMINES NOT ONLY COMMON MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES IN CONTEMPORARY ARCHITECTURE BUT ALSO THOSE FROM ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL TIMES IN ORDER TO PRESERVE AND TRANSFER ALMOST-FORGOTTEN, OBSOLETE TECHNIQUES, IMPROVING UPON THEM. LOOKING BACK AT MY CAREER, IF I WERE TO SUM UP THE COMMONALITY IN MY WORK IN ONE WORD, IT WOULD BE A “SENSE OF SPACE.” THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR ME. IN TERMS OF PHOTOGRAPHY, IT RELATES TO COMPOSITION, TIME, SPACE, AND THE SENSE OF LIGHT AND SHADOW. THE CONSISTENT FACTOR ACROSS ALL MY PROJECTS IS WORKING WITH THIS SENSE. WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO COMMISSIONED WORKS, I ALWAYS OVERLY INVEST, SO I END UP USING UP THE ENTIRE FEE. THERE&#39;S HARDLY ANY PROFIT. IT&#39;S LIKE A LOSS ON TOP OF A MINUS (LAUGHS). ALL: (LAUGH) HIROSHI: INDEED, VENTURING INTO ARCHITECTURE HAS BEEN BOTH REWARDING AND A GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE. MY BACKGROUND AS AN ART DEALER AND AN ARCHITECT GAVE ME THE FOUNDATION TO REALIZE THIS ENOURA OBSERVATORY. IT&#39;S TRULY FULFILLING TO SIT HERE WITH FRIENDS ATOP THESE STONES I LOVE. IF I CAN CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AND LEARN, ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE ELSE IS FOOTING THE BILL, IT&#39;S A WONDERFUL JOURNEY (LAUGHS). RICK, YOU&#39;VE BEEN CRAFTING FURNITURE AS WELL, HAVEN&#39;T YOU? RICK: YEAH. BUT I DON&#39;T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN I STARTED (LAUGH.) THERE SEEMS TO BE A COMMON THREAD BETWEEN YOU TWO – A COMMITMENT TO HANDS-ON CREATIVITY. HIROSHI, YOU’RE NOT JUST INTO PHOTOGRAPHY, BUT YOU IMMERSE YOURSELF IN CARPENTRY, CURATING EXHIBITION CONTENT, AND HAVE PENNED NUMEROUS BOOKS. RICK, ASIDE FROM DESIGNING, YOU’RE ALSO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN PATTERN-CUTTING AND EVEN DRAFTING YOUR OWN COLLECTION NOTES AND PRESS RELEASES. IT’S A COMMENDABLE DEDICATION TO YOUR CRAFT. RICK: THAT&#39;S A BIG ASSET FOR US. THERE&#39;S NOWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY DO THAT. THERE ARE NO OTHER HOUSES WHERE THE DESIGNER IS ALLOWED TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT TO LIKE ME. MOST OF THEM HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE SUPERVISING OR TELLING THEM WHAT TO SAY. SO FOR ME, THAT IS A HUGELY INDEPENDENT THING TO BE ABLE TO DO. YOU ARE ALWAYS TALKING BY YOURSELF, AND YOU ALSO POST VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE. FASHION IS COMMUNICATION. SO OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU ARE MAKING FASHION, YOU ARE MAKING THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. ANY CHANCE I HAVE TO COMMUNICATE AND TO CLARIFY WHAT I&#39;M DOING, I TAKE IT. I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE DISCOURAGED ME FROM DOING THAT VIDEO SHOWING THE INTERIOR OF MY HOUSE IN CONCORDIA. THEY WERE SAYING, “WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING SO VULGAR AS JUST DISPLAYING WHAT YOU HAVE.” AND I SAID, “YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE&#39;S A WAY OF DOING IT THAT IS SOFT AND GENTLE AND POSITIVE AND CAN PROMOTE OUR VALUES.” I KNOW THAT CONTENT IS SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO SEE IF I WAS LOOKING ON THE INTERNET. SO I WANT TO PROVIDE THAT. I WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING I’D WANT TO SEE. SO I FELT LIKE IT WAS A NICE CONTRAST TO PEOPLE SHOWING OFF THEIR…. I DON’T KNOW…THEIR ROLLS-ROYCE AND ALL OF THEIR WATCH COLLECTIONS AND STUFF. BUT WHAT I&#39;VE ALWAYS TRIED TO PROMOTE IS THAT THE WORLD CAN HAVE A VERY STRICT SET OF STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO AESTHETICS AND BEAUTY. IF I CAN PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT, THAT&#39;S WHAT I&#39;M HERE FOR. BECAUSE THERE&#39;S A SENSE OF BIGOTRY IN THE WAY THAT BEAUTY AND A CERTAIN SET OF VALUES ARE PRESENTED. BIGOTRY. THAT IS PRESENTED AS THE ONLY VALID OPTION. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HERE ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU SO THAT PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THAT STANDARD SET OF VALUES CAN HAVE ANOTHER OPTION. THAT IS WHAT I’M HERE TO DO. I BELIEVE IT&#39;S THAT TRANSPARENCY THAT ATTRACTS PEOPLE. SPEAKING OF TRANSPARENCY, YOU OFTEN MENTION IN THE COLLECTION NOTES THAT YOU USE ENVIRONMENTALLY CERTIFIED MATERIALS AND ARE ECOLOGICALLY CONSCIOUS. RICK: I DO. I DO. I DO IT BECAUSE I LIKE THE EFFORT. PERSONALLY, I FEEL LIKE THERE IS AN HONOR IN THAT EFFORT. THERE&#39;S ANOTHER SIDE OF ME THAT&#39;S TOO CYNICAL AND THINKS IT&#39;S TOO LATE. WE&#39;RE ALL GOING TO DIE ANYWAY, AS WE TALKED EARLIER, SO IT DOESN&#39;T REALLY MATTER. BUT TO BE CONSIDERATE OF THE WORLD IS A GOOD MESSAGE. SO THAT&#39;S WHY. TO BE THOUGHTFUL, KIND, AND CONSIDERATE IS GREAT. SO I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT LIKE I SAID, IT&#39;S PROBABLY TOO LATE. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DEFINITION OF LUXURY, HIROSHI, YOU WROTE ABOUT THE TEA MASTER “SEN NO RIKYŪ” IN YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY. WABI-CHA EMERGED THROUGH RIKYŪ AND FOUND BEAUTY IN WHAT MANY PERCEIVE AS NEGATIVE QUALITIES - SIMPLE, DECAYED, UNADORNED, TRANSIENCE, AND IMPERFECTION.” I FEEL THERE&#39;S AN OVERLAP WITH RICK OWENS&#39; CREATIONS. NOWADAYS, THERE ISN’T A DAY WE DON’T HEAR THE WORD &quot;LUXURY&quot; IN FASHION. RICK, WHAT DOES LUXURY MEAN TO YOU? RICK: FOR ME, IT&#39;S ABOUT SPACE AND TIME. THE PROPORTION OF SPACE AND TIME. THE LAVISHNESS OF THAT VAST PROPORTION. THE PROPORTION OF THIS PLACE IS A LUXURY. BEING ABLE TO STOP AND STAND STILL IN TIME, I THINK, IS THE UTMOST LUXURY. BY THE WAY, THE GARDEN AT ENOURA OBSERVATORY IS JUST SUBLIME. I CAN&#39;T IMAGINE ANYTHING BEYOND THIS. HIROSHI: THANK YOU (LAUGHS). ONE LAST QUESTION. IF THERE WERE SOMETHING AKIN TO THE ENOURA OBSERVATORY, SAY, IF YOU WERE TO CREATE &quot;RICK OWENS&#39; RUINS,&quot; WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE? RICK: WELL, IT&#39;LL BE EPHEMERAL, AND IT WILL BE OUT OF A FOG THAT SMELLS LIKE LILIES AND TASTES LIKE ICE CREAM. HIROSHI: WONDERFUL (LAUGHS). RICK, SHALL WE GO SEE THE FOSSILS? RICK: YES!

IN L.A., WHERE IT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANYWHERE WITHOUT A CAR, I RENTED A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR AND CHANGED IT EVERY MONTH. BEFORE THAT, I HAD A BLACK T-TOP V8 CAMARO. I&#39;LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE GLORY OF SPEEDING DOWN THE FREEWAY IN THAT CAR, THE TOP OFF, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND CRESTING THE MOUNTAINS AND SEEING THE LIGHTS OF L.A. I HAD KISS BLASTING ON THE STEREO, A BOTTLE OF VODKA BETWEEN MY LEGS, AND I WAS IMMORTAL. THAT WAS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.&nbsp; IN PARIS, EVERY PLACE I NEED TO GET TO IS A CLOSE METRO RIDE OR WALK. GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT SUBWAYS, THE METRO HOLDS GREAT URBAN NOVELTY FOR ME. BUT WHEN I NEED TO GET SOMEWHERE, I USE A DRIVER, USUALLY KEVIN OR GUY.&nbsp; WHEN I&#39;M TRAVELING, I DEFINITELY HIRE A DRIVER SO I CAN SEE THE MOST THE FASTEST.&nbsp; I REALLY HAVE NO INTEREST IN DRIVING ANY MORE, BUT IF I WAS GOING TO ALLOW MYSELF THE LUXURY OF A FULL-TIME CAR AND DRIVER, I&#39;D DEFINITELY GET A DARK METALLIC GREY CITROEN DS, WITH DARK GREY FELTED CASHMERE UPHOLSTERY AND A BAD-ASS STEREO WITH HARDCORE SOUNDPROOFING.

WHAT IS YOUR OWN FIRST-HAND STORY ABOUT THIS, ABOUT YOUR ROOTS AS A DESIGNER?&nbsp; WELL ACTUALLY, WAL-MART DIDN&rsquo;T EXIST THEN AND I DIDN&rsquo;T EVEN HAVE THE IMAGINATION TO DREAM OF A DECADENT LIFE IN PARIS. I&rsquo;M A CATHOLIC CLICH&Eacute;: STRICT CONTROLLED CHILDHOOD, OUT-OF-CONTROL YOUNG ADULT REACTION, GRADUAL STABILIZING. I&rsquo;D PROBABLY CREATE THE WHOLE CYCLE AGAIN IF I WERE A PARENT.

WHAT DOES THIS MUSIC MEAN TO YOU TODAY?&nbsp; SISTERS OF MERCY IS SUCH A GREAT NAME, ISN&rsquo;T IT? I STILL LOVE THAT BAND, BUT NOW IT HAS A SENTIMENTAL LAYER FOR ME. WHO DOESN&rsquo;T LOVE CRYSTAL METH SELF-INDULGENT MELODRAMA?&nbsp; WHAT EVENTS LEAD YOU TO BECOME PART OF THE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD HUSTLER BAR WORLD, AS YOU DESCRIBED IT IN LEE CARTER&rsquo;S INTERVIEW WITH YOU IN HINT MAGAZINE?&nbsp; I DON&rsquo;T REMEMBER ANY SERIES OF EVENTS. JUST AN ENTHUSIASTIC LEAP.&nbsp; THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAD WITH WORKING FOR KNOCK-OFF COMPANIES IN LA, WAS IT SIGNIFICANT?&nbsp; ITS ONLY SIGNIFICANCE WAS IN REPETITION AND TRAINING. I DID IT BECAUSE I KNEW I COULD ALWAYS FIND A JOB WITH AN EMPLOYABLE SKILL. I DON&rsquo;T REMEMBER BEING VERY AMBITIOUS THEN.&nbsp; CAN YOU POINT OUT THINGS, RELATIONSHIPS, PEOPLE AND/OR EVENTS IN YOUR LIFE THAT HAVE SHAPED YOUR AESTHETICS?&nbsp; ONE OF THE THINGS I REMEMBER IS FEELING A SIGH OF RELIEF ON SEEING &rdquo;PINK FLAMINGOS.&rdquo; IT WAS THE CHEERY F CK-YOU TO CONVENTIONALITY I&rsquo;D BEEN WAITING FOR. IT WAS A CELEBRATION OF SELF-INVENTION. FOOTNOTE: I JUST FOUND OUT THAT LARRY LEGASPI, WHO DID THE COSTUMES FOR LABELLE, ALSO DID THE COSTUMES FOR KISS AND THEN DIVINE&rsquo;S COSTUMES FOR THE PLAY &rdquo;PORK&rdquo;! AND YET THERE&rsquo;S HARDLY ANY DOCUMENTATION ON LARRY LEGASPI! I&rsquo;M GONNA TALK ABOUT HIM EVERY CHANCE I GET.&nbsp; YOU HAVE CALLED YOUR STYLE &rdquo;MORE CAMP THAN GOTH.&rdquo; HOW IS IT MORE CAMP THAN GOTH?&nbsp; &rsquo;CAUSE IT&rsquo;S WITH A LOVING WINK.&nbsp; WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR BREAKTHROUGH?&nbsp; BEING RECOGNIZED BY AMERICAN VOGUE PROBABLY GAVE ME THE CREDIBILITY THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. AT THE TIME, THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AMERICAN DESIGNERS TO PROMOTE AND SPONSORED MY FIRST SHOW. I WAS JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED DECLINING. HOW WOULD MY NARROW AESTHETIC SURVIVE THE SPOTLIGHT OF A RUNWAY FOR MORE THAT A COUPLE OF SEASONS? I MIGHT RISK OVEREXPOSING A LIMITED STORY AND BURNING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT COULD EXTEND LONGER QUIETLY. BUT THEN I GOT OVER MYSELF AND THOUGHT &ldquo;F CK IT. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.&rdquo;&nbsp; WHAT&rsquo;S IT LIKE TO BE AN EXPAT AMERICAN IN PARIS? WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR LIFE LIKE TODAY? AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PARISIAN FASHION WORLD?&nbsp; I WAS SO HORRIFIED THAT I DIDN&rsquo;T PICK UP FRENCH EASILY THAT I JUST NEVER TRIED AGAIN. I LOVE FEELING LIKE A VISITOR EVEN THOUGH I&rsquo;VE BEEN HERE SIX YEARS NOW. I LIVE IN A VERY LOVELY BUBBLE AND APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. LIKE ANY PLACE I&rsquo;VE LIVED, I&rsquo;VE REDUCED IT TO A TRIANGLE BETWEEN MY STUDIO/HOME, THE GYM AND A FEW NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANTS. BUT MY WALK TO THE GYM TAKES ME THROUGH PLACE DE LA CONCORDE, THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES AND PALAIS ROYAL NOW.&nbsp; IT&rsquo;S OFTEN SAID THAT YOU HAVE A CULT FOLLOWING. WHAT KIND OF ATTENTION DO YOU GET FROM YOUR FANS, AND WHAT KIND OF CONTACT DO YOU HAVE WITH THEM? HAVE THERE BEEN INCIDENTS, GOOD AND/OR BAD?&nbsp; SORRY TO DISAPPOINT, BUT NOTHING SIGNIFICANT, ALTHOUGH IT DOES REMIND ME OF A KIND OF UNRELATED STORY. SOMEONE INTRODUCED ME TO SIOUXIE SIOUX A FEW YEARS AGO AND SHE SAID, &ldquo;OH YEAH, I REMEMBER SEEING YOU IN THE LOUNGE AT LAX. I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ITALIAN PORN STAR.&rdquo; I&rsquo;LL REMEMBER THAT LINE UNTIL THE DAY I DIE.&nbsp; SEVERAL CELEBRITIES HAVE WORN YOUR CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THIS? DO YOU HAVE ANY DREAM CLIENT(S)?&nbsp; CELEBRITIES HAVE ONE OF EVERYTHING, SO IF YOU&rsquo;RE IN BUSINESS LONG ENOUGH, SOMEONES GOING TO WEAR ONE OF YOUR THINGS IN A PICTURE. I&rsquo;M GLAD WHEN ANYONE BUYS MY CLOTHES.&nbsp; ABOUT ONE OF THE EDWARD STEICHEN IMAGES IN YOUR BOOK &ldquo;L&rsquo;AI-JE BIEN DESCENDU?&rdquo; YOU SAID: &rdquo;IT&#39;S ONE OF MY STANDARDS. IT&#39;S WHAT I WANT LIFE TO BE.&rdquo; WHICH PHOTOGRAPH WAS IT? AND IN WHAT WAY IS IT HOW YOU WANT LIFE TO BE? HOW DO YOU WANT LIFE TO BE?&nbsp; IT&rsquo;S A PICTURE OF AN OPERA SET FROM THE &#39;30S THAT I TORE OUT OF A NEWSPAPER ONCE AND COULD NEVER FIND AGAIN. IT&rsquo;S A BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF A MOMENT OF SPIRITUAL ASCENSION DURING A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IN THE OPERA. THE SET IS MONUMENTAL AND VAGUELY BAUHAUS/DECO. THERE&rsquo;S A FIGURE THAT&rsquo;S MOVING FROM SPIRITUAL PURSUIT TO SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL RESOLUTION. I&rsquo;M NOT SPIRITUAL AT ALL, BUT THERE&#39;S SOMETHING TOUCHING ABOUT THAT MOMENT. AND THE MOOD OF THE PICTURE IS QUIET, DIGNIFIED AND HEROIC.&nbsp; THE FURNITURE LINE: WHAT ARE THE FUTURE PLANS, IN TERMS OF DESIGN AND COLLECTIONS?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M WORKING ON DOING SOME THINGS IN PATE DE VERRE. I&rsquo;LL KEEP DOING FURNITURE FOREVER, WHETHER ANYBODY&rsquo;S PAYING ATTENTION OR NOT.&nbsp; YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT TAKING A STEP FURTHER TOWARDS BUILDINGS/ARCHITECTURE. WHAT WOULD THE DREAM PROJECT BE?&nbsp; ARCHITECTURE SOUNDS KIND OF LOFTY AND I&rsquo;M KIND OF BUSY. SUFFICE TO SAY THAT I LIKE PLAYING WITH VOLUMES.&nbsp; IN WHAT WAY DO YOU IDENTIFY WITH YOUR PROT&Eacute;G&Eacute; GARETH PUGH, AND WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT HIS PARIS DEBUT?&nbsp; I LOVE THAT HE&rsquo;S A FOCUSED TECHNICIAN, FOLLOWING HIS VISION NO MATTER WHAT.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU GET INSPIRED BY, AT THIS MOMENT?&nbsp; -GRACE JONES&rsquo;S &quot;CORPORATE CANNIBAL&quot; VIDEO -TINA TURNER SINGING &rdquo;ACID QUEEN&rdquo; IN THE MOVIE &rdquo;TOMMY&rdquo; -ARCHITECTURE OF CLAUDE PARENT -ARTIST ANDREI MOLODKIN -LARRY F CKING LEGASPI!

I PICK SOMETHING THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME AND WE DISSECT IT AND SEND SNIPPETS BACK AND FORTH BY COMPUTER. WE COMB THROUGH AND ALTER ALMOST EVERY SECOND OF A 15-MINUTE PIECE. I DELIBERATELY STARTED THIS PROJECT WITH HIM BECAUSE I KNEW WHEN I MOVED TO EUROPE WE WOULD INEVITABLY DRIFT APART UNLESS WE HAD A PROJECT TOGETHER.&nbsp; WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR PARTY TRICK?&nbsp; SWOONING.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE A SECRET OBSESSION?&nbsp; NOT REALLY.

I GO EVERY DAY AT 12:30, THEN HAVE LUNCH, TAKE A NAP, AND GO BACK TO WORK. JUST LIKE IN PARIS.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE NEXT PROJECT THAT YOU WORKING ON AT THE MOMENT?&nbsp; IT&#39;S DECEMBER, SO I&#39;M ADJUSTING THE SAMPLES FOR THE WOMEN&#39;S PRECOLLECTION, THE MEN&#39;S RUNWAY COLLECTION, THE MEN&#39;S AND WOMEN&#39;S SHOE AND BAG COLLECTIONS, THE MEN&#39;S AND WOMEN&#39;S DENIM COLLECTIONS AND THE WOMEN&#39;S LILIES JERSEY COLLECTION&mdash;ALL OF WHICH WILL BE SHOWN IN JANUARY. THIS IS OUR BUSIEST TIME. NEXT WEEK I&#39;LL BE WORKING ON THE FURNITURE THAT I&#39;LL BE SHOWING IN NEW YORK LATER THIS YEAR.&nbsp; HOW DID YOU DECIDED TO BECOME A FASHION DESIGNER?&nbsp; I WENT TO ART SCHOOL TO BE AN ARTIST BUT WASN&#39;T CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN MY INTELLECT, SO DECIDED TO PURSUE FASHION WHICH WAS LESS INTIMIDATING. NOW, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE OVERESTIMATED HOW SMART YOU HAVE TO BE TO MAKE ART. BUT I ALWAYS LIKED FASHION AND I PROBABLY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE USING A LIGHTER TOUCH.&nbsp; DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU&#39;LL BE A DESIGNER? WHEN YOU START, DO YOU THINK &quot;WHAT IF I FELL; WHAT IF I&#39;M NOT GOOD ENOUGH?&quot;?&nbsp; WELL, I DEFINITELY HAD FRUSTRATIONS AND HARD TIMES, BUT I DON&#39;T REMEMBER FEELING I WAS ANY WORSE THAN A LOT OF WHAT I SAW OTHER PEOPLE DOING. IT WAS WHAT IT WAS.&nbsp; AT THE BEGINNING, DID YOU KNOW THAT THE FASHION THAT YOU ARE CREATING WOULD BE THAT SUCCESSFUL?&nbsp; I&#39;M AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE THAT I GOT THIS FAR.&nbsp; WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING THAT YOU CREATED? AND THE FIRST THING THAT MADE YOU FAMOUS?&nbsp; I SUPPOSE IT WAS MY LEATHER JACKETS THAT PEOPLE NOTICED FIRST. CORINNE DAY DID A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF KATE MOSS IN ONE FOR FRENCH VOGUE AND I ASKED CORRINE TO KEEP THAT JACKET. LATER I HEARD THAT CORINNE WAS BURIED IN IT. I DO THE SAME JACKETS IN EVERY COLLECTION TODAY.&nbsp; WHAT INSPIRES YOU? NATURE, ANIMALS, WOMENS, FAIRIES? WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR COLLECTION I SEE MODERN URBAN NOMADS, WOOD FAIRIES IN A BIG CITY; ROMANTICISM AND NATURE AND MINIMALISTISM AND CITIES?&nbsp; I LOVE THE EXTREME OPPOSITES OF NATURE AND CONTROLLED ARTIFICE. AND I LIKE THEM COMBINED. I LIKE TO THINK OF SAVAGE WILDS AND SEVERE ARCHITECTURE. I ALSO LIKE TO THINK OF REDUCTIVE NEEDS. A FUR ON A ROCK NEXT TO A FIRE IN A CAVE.&nbsp; ARE YOU EVER INSPIRED BY REAL OR FICTIONAL PLACES?&nbsp; BOTH. I&#39;M A REALISTIC UTOPIAN. I LIKE EXTREME DISCIPLINE AND VIRTUE EVEN THOUGH I SUSPECT THEY&#39;RE DELUSIONAL AND POINTLESS.&nbsp; WE KNOW THAT MICHELE LAMY IS YOUR MUSE. TELL US MORE ABOUT HER, HOW YOU MET HER, ABOUT YOUR LOVE AND INSPIRATION.&nbsp; SHE&#39;S A BEAUTIFUL MAGIC WITCH THAT SEES A MILLION THINGS I DON&#39;T. SHE&#39;S FEROCIOUS, IMPERIOUS AND TENDER. SHE&#39;S THE MOST BARBARIC AND SOPHISTICATED PERSON I&#39;VE EVER MET. WE&#39;VE BEEN TOGETHER OVER 20 YEARS AND IT JUST SEEMS TO GET BETTER. I CAN&#39;T IMAGINE EITHER OF US WITH ANYBODY ELSE.&nbsp; TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. WHERE DID YOU GROW UP, WHAT WERE YOUR SURROUNDINGS LIKE, AND WHAT WERE YOU INTERESTED IN?&nbsp; I GREW UP A SISSY IN A SMALL JUDGMENTAL TOWN IN CALIFORNIA. I WAS AN ONLY CHILD AND SOCIALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. BY NECESSITY I TOUGHENED UP AS I GOT OLDER BUT SUPPRESSED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RAGE THAT PROBABLY STILL FUELS ME TODAY.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU PLAN YOUR WORK? DO YOU THINK A LOT BEFORE YOU START CREATING A NEW COLLECTION OR DO YOU RELY ON INSTINCT?&nbsp; I TRY NOT TO ANALYZE TOO MUCH, BUT I THINK I PROBABLY EXERT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT FORCING MYSELF TO NOT OVERTHINK.&nbsp; HOW MANY PEOPLE WORK AT RICK OWENS?&nbsp; 10 PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE IN PARIS, AND ABOUT 20 IN ITALY.&nbsp; HOW IS YOUR SELL-THROUGH NOW THAT WE&#39;RE IN A RECESSION?&nbsp; I NEVER EXPECT ANYTHING SO I&#39;M ALWAYS DELIGHTED BY THE RESULTS. I ALWAYS THINK IT&#39;S A MIRACLE WE HAVE ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT &#39;TIL THE NEXT COLLECTION.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE SECRET TO SELLING WELL?&nbsp; I JUST TRY AND LISTEN TO MYSELF. LET&#39;S SEE HOW LONG THAT WORKS.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S THE IDEA BEHIND THE SPRING/SUMMER 2011 COLLECTION?&nbsp; I WANTED A SEVERE OPULENCE. I WANTED THE LUXURY OF METERS AND METERS OF FRESH SILK AND COTTON SWIRLING AROUND A NAKED BODY IN A SUMMER BREEZE. I WANTED A SACRIFICIAL SUMPTUOUSNESS.&nbsp; AND FOR FALL/WINTER 2011? WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?&nbsp; IT WILL BE AN EVOLUTION OF SPRING. EVERY COLLECTION IS ALWAYS AN EXTENSION OF THE ONE BEFORE. I WANT THERE TO BE A DELIBERATE RATIONAL PACE TO WHAT I DO.&nbsp; IS BLACK YOUR FAVORITE COLOUR?&nbsp; NO, GREY IS.&nbsp; WHICH IS THE THING THAT YOU ARE MOST PROUD OF?&nbsp; I&#39;M PROUDEST OF CONVINCING A FAST-PACED FASHION WORLD TO TOLERATE A SLOW-PACED DESIGNER WHO CAN ONLY WORK IN GREYS.&nbsp; HOW TALENTED DOES A PERSON NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO BE A GOOD DESIGNER?&nbsp; PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH AS WE THINK. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER FACTORS THAT MAKE SOMETHING WORK. I&#39;M LUCKY TO HAVE VERY DEVOTED, PROTECTIVE AND WORKAHOLIC PARTNERS.&nbsp; WHAT IS IT LIKE LIVING IN PARIS?&nbsp; PARIS HAS AN UNFORGIVING, RUTHLESS CHIC. IT HAS MAGIC LIGHT AND A HISTORY OF ARTIFICE AND LITERATURE THAT MADE GROWING UP EASIER FOR ME.&nbsp; WHICH IS YOUR FAVORITE SPOT IN PARIS? AND IN THE WORLD?&nbsp; I LOVE WALKING THROUGH THE TUILERIES ON THE WAY TO THE GYM. I LOVE THE WAY THE GARDENS CHANGE WITH THE SEASONS AND HOW THEY&#39;VE CHANGED THAT WAY FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. I LOVE THE SCALE AND PROPORTIONS OF ITS FLOWERBEDS AND TREE-LINED WALKWAYS.&nbsp; AND IN THE WORLD, I SUPPOSE MY FAVORITE PLACE IS ANYWHERE NEXT TO AN OCEAN.&nbsp; TELL US ABOUT FURNITURE.&nbsp; WELL, FURNITURE IS JUST A NATURAL EXTENSION OF CLOTHES. AFTER THE CLOTHES ARE MADE, THE NEXT STEP IS TO CONTROL AND CREATE THEIR ENVIRONMENT; WHERE THEY SIT AND LEAN AGAINST AND STAND.&nbsp; IF YOU COULD CREATE ONLY ONE MORE PIECE OF CLOTHING FOR THE REST YOUR LIFE, WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE?&nbsp; IT WOULD BE A SILK JERSEY DJELLABA TO WEAR IN A WALLED GARDEN.&nbsp; HOW DID YOUR HEELED BOOTS FOR MEN COME ABOUT? ARE THEY COMFORTABLE?&nbsp; COMFORT ISN&#39;T ALWAYS IMPORTANT. SOMETIMES STANDING HIGHER, STRAIGHTER AND PROUDER IS. AND THERE&#39;S SOMETHING WONDERFULLY TRANSGRESSIVE AND VIRILE IN SEEING THE RIGHT MAN IN HEELS.

CONCRETE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MATERIALS TO WORK WITH. IT SUGGESTS IMMOVABILITY, BLUNTNESS AND SILENCE. IT&#39;S MY REACTION TO EXCESSIVE HYPERBOLIC INFORMATION. I WORKED WITH MY AMULETS AND FETISHES: HAIR, ANTLERS AND CRYSTALS. I DON&#39;T BELIEVE IN THEM, OR IN ANYTHING, REALLY. I JUST LIKE THE CEREMONY AND SUPERSTITION ATTACHED TO THEM. A NEED FOR FAITH.&nbsp; DO YOU READ ART BOOKS? IF SO, ARE YOU INSPIRED BY THEM?&nbsp; I LOVE LOOKING THROUGH BOOKS ON BRANCUSI, LUIGI COLANI AND STEVEN PARRINO, TO NAME A FEW. TWO OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS ARE &ldquo;ON THE WAY TO WORK&rdquo; BY DAMIEN HIRST AND &ldquo;THE BAT AND THE BUTTERFLY&rdquo; ABOUT ROBERT DE MONTESQUIOU. THE HIRST BOOK IS A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH HIRST THAT ARE CHARMING BUT VERY DIRECT AND INTIMATE REGARDING HIS CREATIVE PROCESS. THE MONTESQUIOU BOOK IS ALMOST THE OPPOSITE. MONTESQUIOU IS AN EXTREMELY AFFECTED AND SUPERFICIAL CREATURE.

I KIND OF GLIBLY MENTIONED &ldquo;PRIESTESSES OF LONGING.&rdquo; I&rsquo;D KNOWN THIS KIND OF QUESTION WAS COMING AND I&rsquo;D THOUGHT &ldquo;WELL, SOMEONES GONNA ASK. WHAT IS IT I&rsquo;M TRYING TO EXPRESS?&rdquo; AND I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THE WORD &ldquo;LONGING.&rdquo; IT&rsquo;S THE ROOT OF EVERY OPERA, EVERY POP SONG, EVERY RELIGION, EVERY ADVERTISEMENT. LONGING FOR LOVE, LONGING FOR A HIGH, LONGING FOR VALIDATION. AND WHAT IF LONGING WAS ELIMINATED? MIGHT THAT NOT JUST LEAVE A DISCIPLINED FUNCTIONALITY? THAT KIND OF IDEA APPEALED TO ME. LONGINGS, URGES AND POSSESSIVENESS IS SOMETHING I&rsquo;D GRADUALLY BEEN WANTING TO RETREAT FROM AS I GOT OLDER. I DON&rsquo;T KNOW IF I HAVE, OR IF I&rsquo;M KIDDING MYSELF. PROBABLY BOTH. BUT DOESN&rsquo;T &ldquo;PRIESTESSES OF LONGING&rdquo; SOUND PRETTY?&nbsp; YOU ALSO DESIGN A MEN&rsquo;S LINE; LILIES (A JERSEY COLLECTION FOR WOMEN); DRKSHDW (A DENIM COLLECTION FOR MEN AND WOMEN); AND FURNITURE. DO YOU USE THE SAME INSPIRATIONS AND REFERENCES FOR ALL YOUR COLLECTIONS?&nbsp; YES, I DO. I&rsquo;M SOMEWHAT OF A PRAGMATIST. I DON&rsquo;T REALLY DO FANTASIES. MAYBE I SHOULD.&nbsp; OUT OF THE 5 COLLECTIONS YOU DESIGN, WHICH DO YOU FIND THE MOST CHALLENGING?&nbsp; DENIM. I NEVER WEAR JEANS ANYMORE. THEY&#39;RE JUST TOO STIFF AND UPTIGHT. HOW DOES SOMEONE DO SOMETHING MODERN WITH SOMETHING SO PROSAIC AND NORMAL? BUT DON&rsquo;T GET ME WRONG, I DO ENJOY THE CHALLENGE. PERSONALLY, I JUST WEAR SWEATPANTS AND SHORTS SO I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO CHANGE FOR THE GYM EVERY DAY. I LIKE WEARING A UNIFORM. LIKE ALAIA. OR HITLER. OR A PRIEST.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;VE RECENTLY OPENED STORES IN NEW YORK CITY AND LONDON. I WOULD IMAGINE THE PROCESS OF FINDING THE RIGHT SPACE WOULD BE VERY STRENUOUS. WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR WHEN SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT SPOT?&nbsp; SURPRISINGLY, ALL THE STORES JUST FELL FROM THE SKY. I NEVER LOOKED FOR THEM OR PLANNED FOR THEM. BUT AFTER THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST ONE, I GUESS MORE JUST SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA. IT&rsquo;S GOTTA HAVE GOOD BONES AND BE DISCREET BUT NOT BE TOO FAR AWAY FOR SHOPPERS TO WALK TO. I&rsquo;M QUIET BUT I&rsquo;M NOT AN IDIOT.&nbsp; FUTURE PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES? WHICH CITIES?&nbsp; SEOUL IS NEXT.&nbsp; YOU MOVED FROM LOS ANGELES TO PARIS IN 2003. WHY?&nbsp; IT WAS JUST TOO LONG A SCHLEP FROM L.A. TO ITALY, WHERE I&rsquo;D STARTED MANUFACTURING AT THE TIME. IT WASN&rsquo;T THAT BIG OF A DEAL TO MOVE.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU MISS THE MOST ABOUT L.A.?&nbsp; SUNNY WINTER MORNINGS.&nbsp; LEAST?&nbsp; DRIVING.&nbsp; BEST RESTAURANT IN PARIS?&nbsp; NO CLUE.&nbsp; SHOP?&nbsp; MINE. GO BUY SOMETHING.&nbsp; CLUB?&nbsp; DON&rsquo;T GO.&nbsp; DO YOU GO OUT MUCH?&nbsp; RARELY. THE MAIN REASONS FOR TO GO OUT WERE TO GET LAID, WASTED OR NOTICED. I DON&rsquo;T DO ANY OF THOSE ANYMORE BUT I DO DANCE. DANCING IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND PUREST ACTS OF JOY THAT THERE IS. IF I GO OUT, IT&rsquo;S TO SOMEPLACE BLACK, AFTERHOURS, WITH AN ARMY OF MEN FOCUSED ON THE MUSIC.&nbsp; YOU RARELY ATTEND ANY SHOWS BUT YOU WERE RECENTLY SPOTTED AT GARETH PUGH&rsquo;S SPRING/SUMMER 09 SHOW IN PARIS. HOW WAS IT?&nbsp; IT WAS WONDERFUL. FOCUSED AND EDITED.&nbsp; WHICH OTHER DESIGNERS DO YOU ENJOY?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M A BIG FASHION FAN OF A LOT OF DESIGNERS.&nbsp; DO YOU READ FASHION MAGAZINES?&nbsp; SURE. ON THE PLANE.&nbsp; WATCH TV?&nbsp; NO. I&rsquo;LL WATCH ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF SOME OLD MOVIE ON TCM EVERY NIGHT AND FALL ASLEEP.&nbsp; WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN ROTATION ON YOUR IPOD? CD PLAYER? RECORD PLAYER? COMPUTER?&nbsp; JOEY BELTRAM, AUTECHRE, LABELLE, KISS AND ALWAYS MONTSERRAT CABALLE.&nbsp; YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH IN LESS THAN A DECADE.

IT CAN BE AN EXPRESSION OF JOY AND A WAY TO BRING SOMETHING TO THE PARTY OF LIFE.&nbsp; DESCRIBE THE GENERAL PROCESS YOU GO THROUGH TO DESIGN AND REALIZE A PIECE OF CLOTHING.&nbsp; I ANALYZE WHAT I DID THE SEASON BEFORE AND THINK OF THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP. I NEVER START FROM ZERO. EACH COLLECTION IS A REFLECTION AND EVOLUTION OF THE ONE BEFORE. I CREATE A STORY WITH FABRICS AND TEXTURES FIRST AND USUALLY HAVE A SILHOUETTE THAT I&#39;M INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING. I REVIEW THE NOTES I&#39;VE ACCUMULATED ON AIRPLANE FLIGHTS AND AT THE GYM. I THEN HAVE TOILES MADE FROM PREVIOUS SEASONS AND PROCEED TO MODIFY AND MANIPULATE THEM ON THE BODY. I HATE BEING LATE OR RUSHED SO I USUALLY HAVE THE NEXT SEASON MAPPED OUT BEFORE THE RUNWAY SHOW OF THE SEASON BEFORE IT. I&#39;VE LEARNED FROM PAST MISTAKES.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE MAKES A QUALITY ARTICLE OF CLOTHING?&nbsp; TEXTURE, SILHOUETTE, LOGIC. IN THAT ORDER, I THINK.&nbsp; TELL ME ABOUT THE SPRING COLLECTION.&nbsp; I WANTED TO EXPRESS AN AUSTERE OPULENCE. I WANTED THE WEARER TO FEEL THEIR BODY SWIMMING IN SWIRLS OF FABRIC EXTENDING IN A FOG AROUND THEM. I WANTED THE GRANDEUR OF VOLUME WITH THE RESTRAINT OF COTTON SILK POPLINS AND CANVASES.&nbsp; DO MUSIC AND FILM INSPIRES YOUR DESIGN?&nbsp; I&#39;M REVISITING KEN RUSSELL&#39;S &quot;TOMMY&quot; RIGHT NOW : THE ACID QUEEN SEGMENT WITH TINA TURNER AND THE RAINING CHAMPAGNE SEGMENT WITH ANN-MARGRET. YOUTUBE IT. FILM AND MUSIC DOESN&#39;T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT FOR ME.&nbsp; I HEARD YOU HAVE A DEEP INTEREST IN ARCHITECTURE AND INTERIOR DESIGN. WOULD YOU PROJECT THE IDEAS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF YOUR DESIGN?&nbsp; I LOOK TO ARCHITECTURE AS REFERENCE AND INSPIRATION MORE THAN FASHION. THE LOGIC AND BRUTALISM OF LE CORBUSIER, CARLO SCARPA AND LUIGI MORETTI, PRIMARILY. THE CONSISTENCY AND PERMANENCE OF THEIR OUTPUT SOOTHES ME INTO KNOWING WHAT MY NEXT STEP IS.&nbsp; DOES THE FURNITURE YOU DESIGN COME FROM THE SAME AESTHETIC AS YOUR OWN BRAND?&nbsp; IT&#39;S ALL THE SAME STORY. I SEE THE CLOTHES IN THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT.&nbsp; WHAT IS A GOOD FORM FOR YOU, ON BOTH FURNITURE AND CLOTHES?&nbsp; A GRACEFUL, INTELLIGENT LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B.&nbsp; IF YOU TELL US JUST ONE THING ABOUT YOURSELF, WHAT WOULD IT BE?&nbsp; I&#39;M VERY GRATEFUL TO BE IN THE POSITION TO EXPRESS MYSELF CREATIVELY, AND I DON&#39;T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.&nbsp; ARE YOU BEING HARD ON YOURSELF?&nbsp; USUALLY. THAT&#39;S THE TRADE-OFF YOU MAKE.&nbsp; IS FASHION AN ART FORM OR JUST A WAY TO EXPRESS ONESELF?&nbsp; WITH MS. KAWAKUBO, MAYBE ART. WITH ME, PROBABLY NOT.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GARETH PUGH&#39;S ACHIEVEMENT NOW?&nbsp; GARETH IS AN INEVITABLE FORCE. I JUST SEE HIS WORK GETTING MORE AND MORE REFINED. AND HE&#39;S SUCH A LOVELY GUY.&nbsp; EDITORS SEEM INTENT ON WAVING THE GOTH BANNER OVER YOU. WHAT DO THINK ABOUT THAT?&nbsp; IT&#39;S NOT A LABEL I WOULD HAVE COME UP WITH BUT IN A BUSY WORLD THAT NEEDS TO SUMMARIZE, I ACCEPT IT. COMPARED TO A LOT OF OTHER LABELS, I SUPPOSE IT APPLIES. BUT I WOULD HATE FOR IT TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE. I WANT MY CLOTHES TO BE FOR ANYONE.&nbsp; FOR US, RICK OWENS IS SEEMINGLY UNBREAKABLE. IS THAT THE REAL YOU?&nbsp; TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. I&#39;VE GOTTEN MORE THAN MY SHARE IN LIFE SO IF IT ALL WENT AWAY, I STILL WOULD HAVE HAD A GREAT TIME.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF AN IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT?&nbsp; LEAVING LOVE IN YOUR WAKE.&nbsp; IN WRAPPING UP, WHAT CAN YOU SEE YOURSELF IN FIVE YEARS&#39; TIME?&nbsp; PLAYING WITH A KITTEN IN A WALLED GARDEN.

COULD YOU SHARE WITH US THE CONCEPT BEHIND ITS DESIGN AND D&Eacute;COR?&nbsp; I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A LEATHER BAR DESIGNED BY EILEEN GREY IN THE BACK OF MY MIND WHEN WE DO THE STORES. LOTS OF SURFACES IN BLACK PLYWOOD AND CONCRETE THAT HAVE THE PRIMITIVE QUALITY OF A CAVE FILLED WITH ROCKS. I WANT THERE TO BE A BRUTALIST RAWNESS THAT CONTRASTS WITH THE ELEGANCE I&#39;M HOPING TO REACH WITH THE CLOTHES.&nbsp; PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SAY HOW DELIGHTED I AM TO HAVE A LITTLE CORNER IN CHINA. I AM HONORED TO FEEL WELCOMED HERE.&nbsp; YOUR SPRING 2011 COLLECTION WAS SHOWN A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE DATED SNOW WHITE IMAGE INTO AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL PRINCESS FROM THE FUTURE WITH ELEGANT, ETHEREAL DESIGNS IS AMONG YOUR BEST COLLECTIONS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE COUTURE-ESQUE SILHOUETTES AND THE NEO-FEMININE STYLE?&nbsp; I WAS LOOKING FOR AN AUSTERE OPULENCE. THE GLAMOUR OF VOLUME OF METERS AND METERS OF FABRIC THAT WERE SUCH A WONDERFUL GESTURE WITH CHRISTIAN DIOR&#39;S NEW LOOK AFTER THE AUSTERITY OF A WAR. I WAS ALSO THINKING OF THE NAKED BODY FLOATING INSIDE A FRESH COCOON. HONESTLY, I DIDN&#39;T FEEL IT WAS A DEPARTURE, BUT AN EVOLUTION OF FORM AND SILHOUETTE THAT I&#39;VE BEEN DOING ALL THE TIME.&nbsp; YOUR FURNITURE COLLECTION WAS LAUNCHED EARLIER THIS YEAR. WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR LATEST CREATIONS FOR THE HOME? WILL THESE BE AVAILABLE IN THE HONG KONG STORE?&nbsp; I LOVE VESSELS. I&#39;M CURRENTLY WORKING ON BRONZE VASES, BOWL, URNS, FROM SOMETHING SMALL THAT ONLY HOLDS ONE FLOWER, TO SOMETHING LARGE TO HOLD A SMALL TREE. OR EVEN BETTER, TO SIT ON A PLINTH HOLDING NOTHING AT ALL. THESE AND CHAIRS AND STOOLS WILL CIRCULATE THROUGH ALL OF THE STORES AS WILL MY FAVORITE MOVIES AND BOOKS.&nbsp; RICK OWENS SNEAKERS, LEATHER BOOTS WITH GEOMETRICAL OUTLINES, BIKER JACKETS, AND THE LILIES AND DRKSHDW COLLECTIONS HAVE BECOME SOUGHT-AFTER ITEMS AMONG THE YOUNG. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NEW DESIGNERS FOLLOWING YOUR LEAD?&nbsp; I DON&#39;T THINK AN AESTHETIC CAN BE OWNED. ONCE IT&#39;S BEEN RELEASED, IT&#39;S IN THE AIR FOR EVERYONE.&nbsp; RICK OWENS LOVES LEATHER. TRUE?&nbsp; TRUE. I LOVE THE RAWNESS, THE PRIMAL CONNECTION AND THE HINT OF TRANSGRESSION IN LEATHER. AND I LOVE TURNING ALL OF THAT INTO SOMETHING SOFT AND GRACEFUL.&nbsp; YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF GARETH PUGH. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE FOR HIM, IN FACE OF THE RUMORS OF PUGH WITH BIG NAMES SUCH AS DIOR HOMME?&nbsp; I&#39;VE ALWAYS LET GARETH KNOW THAT I THINK HE&#39;S WONDERFUL AND SHOULD JUST CONCENTRATE ON SINGING HIS OWN SONG. BUT MAYBE HE&#39;S MORE OPEN TO OTHER IDEAS THAN I WOULD BE.&nbsp; WHICH IS YOUR PREFERRED PERSONALITY TYPE, RALPH LAUREN OR REI KAWAKUBO?&nbsp; I&#39;M PRETTY SURE YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.&nbsp; WHERE WOULD YOU PREFER TO LIVE: L.A. OR PARIS?&nbsp; I HAVE LOVED LIVING IN BOTH. SOMEDAY I WILL LOVE LIVING SOMEWHERE ELSE. PERHAPS CHINA. IT&#39;S LOVELY NOT HAVING TO CHOOSE.&nbsp; HOW DID YOU MEET MICHELE LAMY?&nbsp; I WORKED AS A PATTERN MAKER IN HER CLOTHING COMPANY FOR 2 YEARS BEFORE I COULD UNDERSTAND HER ACCENT. THEN WHEN I DID, WE BOTH LEFT WHO WE WERE WITH AND HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR OVER 20 YEARS. I CAN&#39;T IMAGINE BEING WITH ANYONE ELSE.&nbsp; WHAT, IF ANY, WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS YOUR OBSESSION?&nbsp; IT USED TO BE COLLAPSE. NOW IT&#39;S DISCIPLINE.&nbsp; HOW OFTEN DO YOU GO TO THE GYM?&nbsp; FIVE TO SIX TIMES A WEEK. IT&#39;S MY MEDITATION, RELEASE AND DISCO BREAK OF THE DAY.&nbsp; WHAT MUSIC ARE YOU LISTENING TO AT THIS MOMENT?&nbsp; HARD TON, CRAZY B TCH IN A CAVE, MONTSERRAT CABALLE, TRANCE GENERATORS, DOROTHY SQUIRES.&nbsp; COULD YOU NAME A FEW OF YOUR WARDROBE STAPLES/NEW ADDITIONS RIGHT NOW?&nbsp; BLACK T-SHIRTS, BLACK SKIRT-SWEATPANTS AND A SABLE COAT.

WHAT WAS IT FOR YOU?&nbsp; I DIDN&rsquo;T HAVE THE BALLS TO BE AN ARTIST. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT IT TAKES MORE BALLS TO BE A DESIGNER; YOU&rsquo;RE TESTED AND JUDGED MORE OFTEN, AND HAVE TO BE RELEVANT AND COMMERCIAL AT A MUCH FASTER PACE. ARTISTS CAN AFFORD TO BE SUPERIOR, SARCASTIC AND CONFRONTATIONAL. AS YOU CAN SEE, I&rsquo;M A LITTLE ANTI-CONTEMPORARY ART RIGHT NOW.&nbsp; DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST FASHION SHOW? WAS IT ONE OF THOSE COME OUT AND GRAB-THE-WORLD-BY-STORM COLLECTIONS THAT IMMEDIATELY PUT YOUR NAME ON THE MAP?&nbsp; JUST THE FACT THAT I WAS ENDORSED BY VOGUE MADE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE. I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE MOMENT IN FASHION WHERE I HAD SOME SPACE AROUND ME THAT MADE ME NOTICEABLE. AT THE TIME, I WAS TOO DUMB TO KNOW WHAT IT REALLY MEANT. THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT NOBLE ROUGHNESS THAT IS MADLY ATTRACTIVE.&nbsp; I GUESS ONE HAS TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WHEN CREATING SOMETHING SO IT DOESN&rsquo;T GO TOO SMOOTHLY. DO YOU BELIEVE SMOOTH PERFECTION IS A RATHER BORING THING?&nbsp; SMOOTH PERFECTION CAN BE BREATHTAKING. THAT&rsquo;S JUST NOT WHAT I&rsquo;M GOOD AT.&nbsp; COULD YOU DEFINE &ldquo;THE LUXURY OF NOT CARING&rdquo;?&nbsp; FREEDOM.&nbsp; IN THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CAREER, YOU USED TO COPY PATTERNS OF DESIGNER CLOTHING FOR KNOCKOFF COMPANIES BASED IN L.A. NOWADAYS IT&rsquo;S PROBABLY SAFE TO SAY THAT QUITE A FEW BRANDS &ldquo;PAY HOMAGE&rdquo; TO YOUR DESIGN BY NIPPING AT YOU LIKE GOLDFISH. DO YOU FIND IT FLATTERING OR AGGRAVATING WHEN PEOPLE TAKE YOUR IDEAS AND MAKE THEM CHEAPER?&nbsp; I THINK IT&rsquo;S SOMETHING IN THE AIR, AND I DON&rsquo;T OWN IT.&nbsp; THE UNQUESTIONABLE FOCUS OF YOUR FALL/WINTER 2009/10 COLLECTION? THERE IS OFTEN A DARKNESS TO YOUR THEMES. AS YOU ONCE SAID, YOU ARE &ldquo;ALL ABOUT DEAD LILIES.&rdquo; THIS SEASON YOUR DARK PRINCESSES WERE JOINED BY THE PALE ANGELS OF DEATH (WHO ROB MEN OF THE VITAL ENERGY AND COURAGE TO DIE).&nbsp; I AM ONLY MISSING THE SERPENTS OF TERROR AROUND THEIR HEADS.&nbsp; ARE YOU EVER TORMENTED BY DEMONS?&nbsp; OH, GOD, NO. I DON&rsquo;T HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR COMPLEXITY AND SUFFERING, ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE DRAMA OF IT. FROM A DISTANCE.&nbsp; DO YOU EVER THINK LIKE: &ldquo;A SHOT OF COLOUR IS JUST WHAT THAT LOW-KEY DRESS CALLS FOR&rdquo;?&nbsp; I SUPPOSE SO, IN MY OWN WAY. IT WOULD USUALLY TAKE THE FORM OF ANOTHER TEXTURE, OR WHITE ON BLACK, OR BLACK ON WHITE.&nbsp; WHICH PIECE OF THE COLLECTION WAS ONE OF THE MOST TECHNICALLY COMPLEX CREATIONS, IN SPITE OF ITS SIMPLE APPEARANCE?&nbsp; WELL, I HAD TO SEND THE BOOTS BACK A COUPLE OF TIMES.&nbsp; THE BEST ANTIDOTE TO GREY AUTUMN SKIES AND COLD DARK EVENINGS?&nbsp; A SATYAJIT RAY MOVIE WITH WARM CHOCOLATE CAKE.&nbsp; THE MOST INTERESTING RUNWAY TREND YOU&#39;VE SEEN GROWING THIS SEASON?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M GLAD TO SEE A SLIGHT IDEA OF FLAMBOYANCE CREEPING BACK INTO FASHION, STARTING WITH STRONGER SHOULDERS. I ALMOST DIDN&rsquo;T DO MINE BECAUSE I WAS HESITANT OF APPEARING TO FOLLOW A TREND. BUT I HAD DONE THOSE PEAKED SHOULDERS IN MY 2001 COLLECTION AND THOUGHT THAT IF ANYONE SHOULD BE DOING AN EXAGGERATED SHOULDER, IT SHOULD BE ME.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE CLOSEST THING TO BROKEN GLAMOUR THAT YOU COULD VISUALIZE WHEN THE TIMES ARE DARK?&nbsp; TIMES ARE NEVER THAT DARK.&nbsp; ACCESSORY FOR A STRIKING INDIVIDUAL THAT SIGNIFIES A MAJOR FINGER UP TO ANY IDEA OF DEPRESSION?&nbsp; SHAVED EYEBROWS.&nbsp; ARE YOU IN AWE OF ANYONE WHOSE INFLUENCE IN IMAGE-MAKING HAS LONG FED INTO WHAT YOU DO?&nbsp; SERGE LUTENS, ROBERT DE MONTESQUIOU, SARAH BERNARDT, DIVINE, JOSEPH BEUYS, LUIGI MORETTI, JAYNE COUNTY, BRANCUSI, RUHLMANN, JEAN-MICHEL FRANK, PIERRE CHAREAU... I COULD GO ON FOREVER.&nbsp; WHO DO YOU HANG OUT WITH?&nbsp; MY BETTER HALF. I DON&rsquo;T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT FOR ANYONE ELSE.&nbsp; IS SOLITUDE PART OF YOUR CREATIVITY?&nbsp; ESSENTIAL.&nbsp; NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE DRESSED IN ENTIRELY THE SAME LABEL. CREATIONS BY WHAT DESIGNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE TEAMED UP WITH YOURS?&nbsp; I COULD NEVER PRESUME TO SUGGEST SOMEONE&rsquo;S PERSONAL CHOICE.&nbsp; TELL ME ABOUT YOUR MUSIC INFLUENCES.&nbsp; OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD: JOEY BELTRAM, LOU REED, WAGNER, JULIE LONDON, MONTSERRAT CABALLE, KISS&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON FAMOUS PEOPLE BECOMING DESIGNERS?&nbsp; EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRY.&nbsp; &hellip; AND DESIGNERS DRESSING CELEBRITIES?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M SURE THIS SYSTEM IS VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR SOME.&nbsp; HOW DOES THE WHOLE THING FIT INTO YOUR AESTHETIC OF BROKEN IDEALISM?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH EITHER OF THESE SYSTEMS TO JUDGE.&nbsp; EVERY BRAND HAS ITS OWN SPIRIT. AT TIMES THE SUCCESS OF ONE HOUSE CANNOT BE REPRODUCED AT ANOTHER. REVILLON STANDS FOR AN IMAGE OF A WOMAN COATED IN WEALTH, WHOSE WILDLIFE INTERESTS EXTEND TO EXOTIC COUTURE. DO YOU FEEL THIS COLLABORATION IS AS YOU EXPECTED IT TO BE?&nbsp; WELL, I HAVEN&rsquo;T BEEN AT REVILLON FOR YEARS, BUT THE EXPERIENCE I HAD WAS VERY SELFISH, I&rsquo;M AFRAID. I WAS ALLOWED TO INDULGE MY VISION OF FURS WITHOUT ADDRESSING ANYONE&#39;S PRECONCEPTIONS. MAYBE THAT WAS A PROBLEM, BUT I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME DOING IT.&nbsp; DOES THE PRESS OFTEN PLAY INTO YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS? OR IS IT THE PUBLIC RESPONSE THAT MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU?&nbsp; IF PEOPLE BUY IT, I GET TO KEEP DOING IT, PERIOD. THE PRESS HAS OTHER PRIORITIES, AND I RESPECT THAT.&nbsp; ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GENERAL LEVEL OF FASHION CRITICISM?&nbsp; ARE YOU KIDDING? I&rsquo;M SATISFIED JUST TO BE CONSIDERED MENTIONABLE.&nbsp; AS AN ART SCHOOL DROP-OUT, DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG TO ELEVATE DESIGNER CLOTHES TO THE LEVEL OF ART?&nbsp; MY QUESTION NOW IS IF ART CAN BE ELEVATED TO THE LEVEL OF FASHION. CONSIDER THIS: A DESIGNER MUST PRESENT COLLECTIONS FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND BE JUDGED ON THE BASIS OF RELEVANCE TO THE MOMENT AND COMMERCIAL VIABILITY. THAT&rsquo;S A REAL TIGHTROPE. AND WHEN I SAY RELEVANCE, THAT&rsquo;S ABOUT A SUBTLE, INSTANT COMMUNICATION OF OUR COMMUNAL CONDITION REFLECTING THE TIME WE&rsquo;RE IN AT THAT INSTANT. A LOT OF THE ART I&rsquo;M SEEING THESE DAYS SUGGESTS AN ARTIST INDULGING IN ARCH COMMENT ON SOCIETY. WITHOUT A REAL DEADLINE. IT GETS A LITTLE SMARTY-PANTS FOR ME.&nbsp; HAS THERE BEEN ONE PIECE OF APPAREL YOU HAVE CREATED THAT YOU REGARD AS A TRANSCENDENT MASTERWORK?&nbsp; OH. PLEASE.&nbsp; THE MOST CLASSIC RICK OWEN-ISM?&nbsp; &ldquo;KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID.&rdquo;&nbsp; WHAT MAKES YOU MAD?&nbsp; UMBRELLAS.&nbsp; WHAT GIVES YOU PEACEFULNESS?&nbsp; CONCRETE.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S YOUR DIVA MOMENT LIKE? DO YOU THROW CLOTHES?&nbsp; I WISH I COULD. I WOULD BE TOO EMBARRASSED TO.&nbsp; YOU MUST HAVE SEEN A HUGE IMPACT ON YOUR COMPANY WITH CELEBRITY EXPOSURE, WHICH MUST BE GRATIFYING, AS YOUR KICK-ASS FASHION PHILOSOPHY HAS CULTIVATED A LOYAL INTERNATIONAL FOLLOWING OF LUMINARIES. I IMAGINE YOU DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO KNOCK ON ANYBODY&rsquo;S DOORS AND RAM THINGS DOWN PEOPLE&rsquo;S THROATS. ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE POWERFUL FRIENDS. ARE YOU ABLE TO WIELD POWER?&nbsp; I HAVE THE GREATEST POWER OF ALL: THE POWER TO WITHDRAW. I DIDN&#39;T START OUT AS A BIG SENSATION SO I HAD A WHILE TO JUST BE THERE. AND NOW I&#39;M JUST THERE. TOO OLD TO BE NEW AND TOO AROUND TO IGNORE, I SUPPOSE. THE MOST POWERFUL RELATIONSHIPS I HAVE ARE WITH MY FABRIC SUPPLIERS AND THE PEOPLE THAT CONSTRUCT MY CLOTHES.&nbsp; MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT FASHION DESIGNERS, SEE THEM VERY TWO-DIMENSIONALLY AND BELIEVE FASHION IS THE ONLY PART OF THEIR LIFE. WHAT OTHER PARTS ARE THERE TO YOU?&nbsp; WHAT OTHER PARTS AM I MISSING?&nbsp; IF YOU COULD HAVE ONE NEW TALENT, WHAT WOULD IT BE?&nbsp; GYMNASTICS.&nbsp; WHICH TOWN BEATS MOST FASHION MAGAZINES WHEN IT COMES TO INSPIRATION?&nbsp; I SUPPOSE I LIKE LONDON.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE BEDTIME CLASSIC?&nbsp; &ldquo;MAPP AND LUCIA&rdquo; BY E. F. BENSON&nbsp; WHERE DO YOU SEE YOUR IMAGE GOING?&nbsp; I&rsquo;LL PROBABLY START BECOMING A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.&nbsp; ANY NEW PROJECTS ON THE WAY?&nbsp; TOKYO STORE OPENING IN SEPTEMBER.

WHY DID YOU SAY YES TO WORK WITH THEM?&nbsp; ACTUALLY, I APPROACHED EASTPAK. I HAD FOND MEMORIES OF SEEING THE STREET KIDS ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD CARRYING THEM. THE BAGS WERE OLD AND DYED BLACK TO MATCH THE BLACK DYED ARMY SURPLUS CLOTHES THEY WORE DECORATED WITH THE METAL ENDS OF USED UP LIGHTERS. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF THIS IS EXACTLY THE IMAGE EASTPAK WANTS TO PROMOTE, BUT IT WAS MY MOTIVATION. MY DRKSHDW DENIM COLLECTION WAS ALWAYS BASED ON THAT.&nbsp; WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO WORK IN FASHION?&nbsp; BECAUSE I DIDN&#39;T HAVE THE BALLS TO BE AN ARTIST.&nbsp; WHAT&rsquo;S THE POINT OF FASHION?&nbsp; COMMUNICATION.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;RE A LATE STARTER. DID YOU EXPECT THINGS TO WORK OUT THE WAY THEY DID?&nbsp; I NEVER EVEN HAD THE IMAGINATION TO DREAM OF IT.&nbsp; WHO AND WHAT INSPIRES YOU? WHY DO YOU THINK YOU FASCINATE PEOPLE? WHERE DID THAT CULT STATUS COME FROM?&nbsp; I&#39;VE ALWAYS LOVED THE IDEA OF SELF-INVENTION AND UNCONVENTIONAL BEAUTY. I&#39;VE TRIED TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE WORLD AS OPPOSED TO AN EXCLUSIVE ONE. MAYBE I&#39;VE PROVIDED A FASHION OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT HAVE BELIEVED IN FASHION.&nbsp; WHAT&rsquo;S THE SECRET OF YOUR SUCCESS?&nbsp; I THINK SUCCESS IS BEING GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING YOU&#39;VE GOT. EVERYBODY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL.&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT?&nbsp; FIGURING OUT THE STRAIGHTEST LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B. HOWEVER, NOT EVERYBODY MIGHT CONSIDER THAT AN ASSET.&nbsp; DO YOU DREAM ABOUT CLOTHES?&nbsp; I ACTUALLY DO DREAM ABOUT CONSTRUCTION OR TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ONCE IN A WHILE. AND I&#39;VE ACTUALLY WOKEN UP WITH SOLUTIONS.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE TASTELESS WEARING YOUR CLOTHES?&nbsp; I KNOW THIS SOUNDS DISINGENUOUS, BUT I&#39;M HONESTLY ALWAYS PLEASED TO SEE THAT SOMEONE FOUND SOMETHING TO RESPOND TO IN MY CLOTHES.&nbsp; WHAT DO PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND ABOUT YOU? AND ABOUT FASHION?&nbsp; I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO BE A BIT MORE FEROCIOUS. I&#39;M AFRAID I&#39;VE DISAPPOINTED SOME. I THINK THAT IT&#39;S EASY TO DISMISS FASHION AS SUPERFICIAL WHEN IT&#39;S ONE OF THE TRUEST AND MOST INSTANT METHODS OF COMMUNICATION AND STUDY OF BEAUTY THAT THERE IS.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE PERSISTENT ALLURE OF VAMPIRES?&nbsp; WELL, WE KNOW IT&#39;S ABOUT SEX. MOST EVERYTHING IS. THE IDEA OF DEVOURING, CONSUMING, POSSESSING SOMEONE WE DESIRE. I THINK IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT THE TITILLATION OF IMAGINING THE MONSTER WE COULD BE IF WE JUST LET OURSELVES GO. WE&#39;RE ALL FASCINATED WITH CORRUPTION. AND THE MORE GLAMOROUS THE BETTER.

YOU ARE FANTASTICALLY RIPPED. WHAT&#39;S THE DEAL?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M NOT REALLY INTO CLOTHES. I WEAR ONE OUTFIT LIKE A UNIFORM. I HAVE FOR YEARS. BLACK SWEATPANTS, BLACK BAGGY SHORTS OVER THEM, A BLACK OR WHITE COTTON T-SHIRT AND A BLACK CASHMERE T-SHIRT OVER THAT. I COULDN&rsquo;T IMAGINE HAVING TO CHANGE OUTFITS EVERY DAY. OR HAVING TO CHANGE FOR THE GYM. AND THIS OUTFIT TAKES ME TO THE GYM, WORK IN THE STUDIO AND TO DINNER WITH A MINK COAT OVER IT. CHANGING YOUR BODY IS SO MUCH MORE HARDCORE. THE EXTREME SENSATION OF WORKING OUT HAS REPLACED THE MOSH PITS OF MY EARLIER YEARS AND THE SEX CLUBS FOR YEARS AFTER THAT. IT&rsquo;S A GREAT COMBO OF DISCIPLINE, JOYOUS RELEASE, MEDITATION AND VANITY. MUSIC NEVER SOUNDED AS GOOD AS IT DOES NOW, POUNDING THROUGH THOSE EARBUD HEADPHONES INTO THE PIT OF MY STOMACH AS I FEEL MY MUSCLES SWELL.&nbsp; LAST SEASON IT WAS SEXY NUNS. TWO SEASONS AGO IT WAS STRAIGHT ARCHITECTURE. FOUR PAST? FURRY CAVEMEN. DID YOU LIFT INSPIRATION FROM ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR FOR YOUR FALL COLLECTION? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE UPCOMING FALL?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M STARTING WITH THE WORD &quot;CRUST&quot; AND LOOKING AT MORE EXTREME TEXTURE. CRUST, BEING A PROTECTIVE LAYER, MADE ME THINK OF VULNERABILITY. NOT SURE WHAT I&rsquo;M GOING TO DO WITH THAT YET. TO TELL THE TRUTH, IT&rsquo;S USUALLY AFTERWARDS, WHEN IT&rsquo;S DONE, THAT I CAN ANALYZE WHERE IT CAME FROM. UNTIL THEN, I TRY NOT TO THINK TOO MUCH.&nbsp; YOU SEEM PRETTY INSPIRED BY ANIMALS AND THEIR FEATURES AND USE LOTS OF ANIMAL MATERIALS IN YOUR COLLECTIONS. WHY THE FASCINATION?&nbsp; I SUPPOSE THERE&rsquo;S A PRIMAL ASSOCIATION THAT APPEALS TO ME, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT&rsquo;S TRANSFORMED AND REFINED INTO SOMETHING ELEGANT. I LIKE TRANSFORMATION.&nbsp; AS FOR YOUR OWN HAIR, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT CUTTING IT?&nbsp; I DOUBT I EVER WILL. I&rsquo;LL BE FINE WITH A LONG COBWEB WREATH WHEN THE TIME COMES.&nbsp; FORGET ABOUT ALL INTERNATIONAL FURRIER AND LEATHER REGULATIONS. FORGET ABOUT PHYSICAL IMPLAUSIBILITY AND COMMODITY RARITY. FORGET ABOUT RULES, MAN. IF YOU COULD MAKE A GARMENT OUT OF ANY MATERIAL WHAT WOULD IT BE?&nbsp; WELL, THERE&rsquo;S A GUY I&rsquo;M WORKING WITH ON SOME HORN ELEMENTS FOR MY NEXT COLLECTION. HE DOES STUFF LIKE CUSTOMIZED CARVED BONE DOOR HANDLES FOR VINTAGE CAR INTERIORS. THAT KIND OF WORLD. HE HAS A PILE OF IVORY TUSKS IN HIS WORKSHOP THAT I&rsquo;M AWEFULLY TEMPTED TO USE FOR FURNITURE. I DO SEE FURNITURE AS AN EXTENSION OF CLOTHES. AND I LOVE SWANSDOWN.&nbsp; HAS YOUR MOVE TO PARIS INFLUENCED HOW YOU THINK ABOUT DESIGN?&nbsp; SURE. IT RAISED THE BAR. THERE&rsquo;S A PLACE THERE FOR A CHIC BORDERING ON THE PERVERSE.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW PARISIANS, NEW YORKERS AND L.A. NATIVES DRESS THEMSELVES? ANY ONE CITY YOU DESIGN WITH IN MIND?&nbsp; I THINK I PREFER NEW YORK STYLE IN GENERAL. THERE&rsquo;S A LITTLE MORE SEVERITY TO MY EYE. BUT I PROBABLY HAVE A CITY DESIGNED BY LE CORBUSIER AND LUIGI MORETTI IN MY HEAD MOST OF THE TIME.&nbsp; IF YOUR FASHION AESTHETIC BECOMES MANIFEST IN A NOISE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?&nbsp; THE LOW HUM OF A HEAVY INDUSTRIAL MOTOR.&nbsp; IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO COMPLETELY UPDATE ONE LONG-ESTABLISHED FASHION HOUSE, WHICH WOULD IT BE? WHAT DIRECTION WOULD YOU TAKE IT?&nbsp; HONESTLY, REVILLON WAS MY ONLY TEMPTATION. I WOULD NEVER BE THE SLIGHTEST BIT INTERESTED AGAIN. I&rsquo;M NOT SAYING THAT BITTERLY. I HAD A LOVELY TIME WITH REVILLON. BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO PUT ALL THAT EFFORT INTO SOMEONE ELSE&#39;S COMPANY WHEN I CAN PUT IT INTO MY OWN?&nbsp; YOU&#39;VE SAID THAT YOU&#39;RE A PRAGMATIC DESIGNER AND THAT YOU&#39;D RATHER SEE YOUR CLOTHES IN STORES THAN OUT ON THE RUNWAY. SO WHY SO QUIET ON THE ADVERTISING FRONT?&nbsp; ADVERTISING PULLS YOU MORE DEEPLY INTO THE FASHION SYSTEM THAN I&#39;M WILLING TO GO. I HAVE ENOUGH. MY BUSINESS IS GROWING AT A PACE GRADUAL ENOUGH TO BE SAFE, AND FAST ENOUGH TO BE MOTIVATING. ADVERTISING&rsquo;S ANOTHER JOB, LIKE RUNWAY SHOWS. ONCE YOU START, YOU NEED TO BE READY TO DO IT FOREVER. THAT BEING SAID, THOUGH, I NEVER THOUGHT I&rsquo;D BE DOING RUNWAY SHOWS.&nbsp; IT&#39;S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING NOW, BUT THE FASHION WORLD HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO THE LUXURIOUSLY LOUCHE AND DRAMATIC LOOK THAT YOU PIONEERED. WE&#39;RE SEEING MOMS IN THE MIDWEST SIDLING INTO YOUR LEATHER JACKETS AND THE COOL CHICKS AT SCHOOL SHELLING OUT FOR A PAIR OF YOUR BOOTS INSTEAD OF THE STANDARD LOUBOUTINS. FROM A GUY WHO&#39;S BEEN DOING THE BEAUTIFULLY DARK AND BROODY THING FOR SO LONG, ANY WORDS OF ADVICE TO YOUR ADMIRERS? WHY DO YOU THINK YOU&#39;RE SO RELEVANT NOWADAYS?&nbsp; WHEN I STARTED OUT, I RESENTED HOW DRAMATIC OR RADICAL FASHION WAS CONFINED TO THE RUNWAY OR SPECIAL OCCASION. I WANTED TO CORRUPT CONFORMITY FROM WITHIN BY TRANSLATING EXTREME SILHOUETTES INTO A SOFT BLACK OR GREY THAT COULD QUIETLY BE PART OF EVERY DAY. I DO SEE HINTS OF THAT HAPPENING AROUND BUT FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WORKED. I THINK IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY, BUT MAYBE I DID HELP.&nbsp; WHAT WAS RICK OWENS THE KID LIKE? RICK OWENS AS A TEENAGER? HOW DO YOU SEE RICK OWENS THE GERIATRIC?&nbsp; RICK THE KID WAS A SOFT SISSY. RICK THE TEENAGER WANTED DESPERATELY TO APPEAR DISSOLUTE. RICK THE GERIATRIC WILL BE DISSOLUTE.&nbsp; I&#39;VE GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR HEELS. ARE THEY COMFORTABLE? I&#39;VE GOT SNEAKERHEAD FRIENDS WHO GO CRAZY OVER YOUR HIGH TOPS, AND ARE SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT YOU MAKE MAN HEELS&mdash;SHOULD THEY BE?&nbsp; UH, DID THEY EVER HEAR &quot;DETROIT ROCK CITY&quot; BY KISS?&nbsp; DESCRIBE A PERFECTLY SELFISH DAY.&nbsp; OUTSIDE IN THE SUN, READING AND SWIMMING.&nbsp; DO THE IGGY POP COMPARISONS EVER GET ANNOYING?&nbsp; OH GOD, NO. I STARTED THEM.&nbsp; YOUR LIFE IN L.A. SEEMED LIKE A BIT OF A DINGY FAIRYTALE FULL OF DRUGS AND BOOZE AND FANTASTICAL CHARACTERS LIKE PERFORMANCE ARTIST VAGINAL DAVIS. TODAY&mdash;WELL, YOU&#39;RE OSTENSIBLY STILL LIVING WHAT WE PLEBES SEE AS KIND OF A FAIRYTALE. THERE&#39;S THE FIVE-STORY MANSION ON THE PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON, THE SCULPTURE OF YOURSELF RELEASING FAKE URINE. WHAT&#39;S THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE L.A. VERSION OF THE RICK OWENS MYTHOLOGY AND THE PARIS VERSION?&nbsp; PROBABLY NOT MUCH. IT&rsquo;S STILL A TRIANGLE OF GYM, WORKING AT HOME AND DINNER DOWN THE STREET. ALL THE OLD FACES COME THROUGH PARIS SOONER OR LATER. OTHER THAN THAT I&rsquo;M ON THE ROAD A LOT MORE THAN I USED TO BE.&nbsp; LAST QUESTION: WHAT&#39;S YOUR BIGGEST VICE?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M A SELFISH CUNT.&nbsp; YOUR BIGGEST VIRTUE?&nbsp; KNOWING I&rsquo;M A SELFISH CUNT.

BOHÈME – BY PETER MCQUAID &#39;&#39;WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE, BEFORE WE OPENED THE CAFE, AND WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY, WE USED TO HAVE TOAST PARTIES,&#39;&#39; RECALLS RICK OWENS, INDICATING IN HIS SOFT-SPOKEN WAY THAT HE&#39;S TALKING ABOUT WHOLE-WHEAT TOAST, NOT CHAMPAGNE.&nbsp; &#39;&#39;WE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE DELI AND BUY SALMON AND WHITEFISH, AND THEN I WOULD SIT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE WITH A LOAF OF BREAD AND A TOASTER AND I WOULD MAKE TOAST, AND WE WOULD PASS IT DOWN, BUCKET-BRIGADE STYLE, AND THE GUESTS WOULD PUT WHAT THEY WANTED ON THE TOAST, AND THAT WAS DINNER. WE HAD THIS INDUSTRIAL REFRIGERATOR IN THE CORNER WITH A GLASS FRONT, AND THAT WAS THE MOOD LIGHTING.&#39;&#39; RICK OWENS SMILES. YOU MIGHT SAY THE DESIGNER AND HIS FRENCH LADYLOVE, MICHELE LAMY, HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THOSE DARK TIMES, WHEN THEY ENTERTAINED IN THREE BOMBED-OUT-LOOKING ATTACHED STOREFRONTS ON A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD, BUT YOU WOULD BE WRONG.&nbsp; THAT WAS BEFORE THE SO-CALLED HOLLYWOOD RENAISSANCE HIT THIS PART OF TOWN. BEFORE LAMY BUILT LOS ANGELES&#39;S HOTTEST BO&Icirc;TE, LES DEUX CAF&Eacute;S, ON A PARKING LOT ACROSS THE STREET, AND BEFORE SID GRAUMAN&#39;S EGYPTIAN DOWN THE BLOCK (YES, THE VERY SAME GRAUMAN OF GRAUMAN&#39;S CHINESE) MORPHED INTO THE AMERICAN CINEMATHEQUE, WHERE YOU CAN CATCH AN EISENSTEIN OR A GRIFFITH OR A FULLY RESTORED PRINT OF ZSA ZSA GABOR IN &#39;&#39;QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE.&#39;&#39; IN OTHER WORDS, OWENS AND LAMY HAVE STAYED PUT, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD (OR AT LEAST THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF IT) HAS COME TO THEM. AFTER YEARS OF KNOCKING AROUND &#39;&#39;DOING KNOCKOFFS AT KNOCKOFF COMPANIES,&#39;&#39; OWENS, 40, STARTED MAKING PATTERNS FOR LAMY, WHO HAD HER OWN CLOTHING LINE AT THE TIME. SINCE THEN, HE&#39;S BEEN OUT ON HIS OWN, DESIGNING THE KIND OF ETHEREAL CLOTHES THAT THE GHOSTS AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT MIGHT WEAR, OWENS BEING PROUDLY GOTH HIMSELF. AND THE WORLD HAS STARTED TO TAKE NOTICE. HE&#39;S SELLING AT MAXFIELD IN L.A. AND HENRI BENDEL IN NEW YORK. HE HAS NEW ITALIAN BACKING. AND OWENS&#39;S FALL SHOW IN NEW YORK WAS FASHION WEEK&#39;S HOTTEST TICKET.&nbsp; SO IF YOU WERE EXPECTING THOSE THREE BLACK STOREFRONTS TO HAVE HAD SOME KIND OF TONY REDO, YOU&#39;D BE WRONG AGAIN. A REAL STUFFED MONKEY GREETS YOU AT THE DOOR. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL WINDOWED OFFICE IN THE WORKROOM AND A WATER CLOSET, TUCKED IN AMONG THE BOLTS OF FABRIC, REAMS OF CASHMERE, OLD FUR AND HANGING PATTERNS, THINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH AS THEY WERE WHEN OWENS AND LAMY FIRST MOVED IN. THERE IS NOW A GRAND PIANO IN THE MAIN ROOM &ndash; OWENS&#39;S CHRISTMAS GIFT TO LAMY -- A THRASHED SOFA COVERED IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE MILITARY-ISSUE WOOL (THE GERMAN ARTIST JOSEPH BEUYS IS ONE OF OWENS&#39;S INSPIRATIONS) AND A RACK OF CLOTHING. THERE IS A SHOWER ENCLOSURE OFF THE DINING ROOM-KITCHEN (BEFORE THAT, SHOWERING WAS DONE AT GOLD&#39;S GYM) AND A MONUMENTAL PLATFORM BED COVERED IN WOOL IN THE WINDOWLESS BEDROOM, WHERE HEAT (EVEN IN L.A., IT&#39;S COLD IN FEBRUARY) IS PROVIDED BY ONE OF THOSE PLUG-IN RADIATORS.&nbsp; THERE IS A MURAL IN THE DRESSING ROOM AND SPACE FOR THE COUPLE&#39;S COLLECTION OF MOSTLY MONOCHROMATIC CLOTHING AND SCUFFED SHOES. BUT THE WALLS ARE WATER-STAINED AND WHAT PAINT THERE IS HANGS IN IMPERTINENT SHARDS, AND IF IT ALL SEEMS A BIT &#39;&#39;GREY GARDENS,&#39;&#39; WELL, THAT&#39;S THE WAY OWENS AND LAMY LIKE IT. TO ENTER THEIR HOME IS TO ENTER A WORLD WHERE DECAY HAS ITS OWN INTEGRITY.&nbsp; IT&#39;S 7 P.M. AND JAN SHARP, AN AUSTRALIAN FILMMAKER, HAS ARRIVED WITH A LATIN AMERICAN ARTIST NAMED EUVA, A RECORD PRODUCER NAMED RICKY FATAAR AND BARBARA LEARY, WHO IS IN FROM BRAZIL.&nbsp; &#39;&#39;I LOVE IT!&#39;&#39; SAYS LEARY, EYEING THE RACKS OF OWENS&#39;S CLOTHES IN THE MAIN ROOM. &#39;&#39;I CAN SHOP AND DINE.&#39;&#39; LEARY, WHO IS FIGHTING A COLD, IS SMOKING A GAULOISES THROUGH A CIGARETTE HOLDER. &#39;&#39;IT&#39;S ONE WAY OF CUTTING THROUGH IT,&#39;&#39; SHE EXPLAINS.&nbsp; SUSAN AND HAROLD BECKER ARRIVE. HAROLD IS A DIRECTOR; SUSAN IS A COSTUME DESIGNER TURNED PRODUCER. SUSAN IS WEARING HEAD-TO-KNEE RICK. SHE HAS FINISHED OFF THE OUTFIT WITH &#39;&#39;COP BOOTS.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I GOT THEM FROM A MOVIE I WAS WORKING ON,&#39;&#39; SHE EXPLAINS. &#39;&#39;THEY ARE SO COMFORTABLE. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING,&#39;&#39; SHE SAYS, UNLACING THE LEFT BOOT. IT HAS A POUCH ON THE INSIDE, PERFECT FOR A SMALL REVOLVER. &#39;&#39;I SUPPOSE IT COULD COME IN HANDY,&#39;&#39; SHE SAYS, THOUGH SHE DOESN&#39;T SEEM MUCH LIKE A PISTOL-PACKIN&#39; MAMA.&nbsp; PAUL FORTUNE, AN INTERIOR DESIGNER AND SOMETIME ACTOR, ENTERS TO KISSES ALL AROUND. &#39;&#39;IT ALL LOOKS QUITE SMASHING, DOESN&#39;T IT?&#39;&#39; HE SAYS OF THE INTERIOR, FESTOONED WITH CANDLES AND FLOWERS, ALL VERY ROMANCE IN A BOMB SHELTER.&nbsp; BOBBY WOODS, A COMPOSER, SLIPS IN NEXT. HE LIKES TO ACCOMPANY MICHELE WHEN SHE CAN BE COAXED INTO SINGING. THE ARTIST KONSTANTIN KAKANIAS ENTERS, ANNOUNCING WITH A SIGH, &#39;&#39;I AM WORKING, WORKING, WORKING.&#39;&#39; HE HAS A SHOW COMING UP IN NEW YORK.&nbsp; SCARLETT, MICHELE&#39;S DAUGHTER BY THE CINEMATOGRAPHER RICHARD NEWTON, IS HERE WITH A FRIEND FROM SCHOOL. ARIANNE PHILLIPS, A STYLIST, IS GOING TO BE A BIT LATE, BUT WHERE&#39;S VAGINAL DAVIS? VAG, RHYMES WITH MADGE, IS THE 6-FOOT-6 AFRICAN-AMERICAN DRAG QUEEN/PERFORMANCE ARTIST WHO HAS FIGURED SO PROMINENTLY IN L.A.&#39;S UNDERGROUND. (HIS MAGAZINE &#39;&#39;FERTILE LA TOYAH JACKSON&#39;&#39; WAS AN L.A. MUST-READ.) HE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE HOSTS. &#39;&#39;SHE&#39;LL GET HERE WHEN SHE GETS HERE,&#39;&#39; OWENS SAYS.&nbsp; ISIS NEAL, THE EXECUTIVE CHEF AT LES DEUX, ARRIVES WITH THE BEGINNINGS OF A FEAST &ndash; OSETRA CAVIAR ON BABY ORGANIC POTATOES, SCALLOPS WITH THREE CAVIARS, RAW OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL AND MUSSELS STEAMED IN VERMOUTH AND TARRAGON. (BESIDES A MICROWAVE, THERE IS NOTHING TO COOK WITH IN THE HOUSE; THE OCCUPANTS TAKE THEIR MEALS ACROSS THE STREET.)&nbsp; THE GUESTS NOW BEGIN TO REGROUP, TRADING GOSSIP, NEWS AND OBSERVATIONS. LEARY IS IN FRONT OF AN ENORMOUS FLOOR-LENGTH MIRROR, TRYING ON ONE OF OWENS&#39;S CASHMERE SWEATER JACKETS. &#39;&#39;I DON&#39;T KNOW,&#39;&#39; MURMURS RICKY FATAAR. AND TO BE FAIR, THE SHAPE OF THE SWEATER IS CHALLENGING. YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ABANDON ALL NOTIONS OF BUTTONS AND ZIPPERS. LEARY, THE WIDOW OF TIMOTHY LEARY, IS NATURALLY UNDAUNTED.&nbsp; &#39;&#39;HOW DO YOU FLING IT?&#39;&#39; ASKS FATAAR, LOOKING AT THE SWATH OF FABRIC HANGING FROM HER CHEST. &#39;&#39;DARLING!&#39;&#39; SHE SAYS, EYEING HERSELF IN THE MIRROR, &#39;&#39;YOU JUST FLING IT!&#39;&#39; SHE DOES.&nbsp; OWENS IS CHOOSING MUSIC. &#39;&#39;I DON&#39;T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK?&#39;&#39; HE ASKS THE VISITOR. &#39;&#39;JULIE LONDON? OH, WAIT,&#39;&#39; HE ANSWERS HIS OWN QUESTION. &#39;&#39;PEGGY.&#39;&#39; AND WHO BETTER THAN THE RECENTLY DECEASED GRANDE DAME TO ASK THE ETERNAL QUESTION &#39;&#39;IS THAT ALL THERE IS?&#39;&#39; OVER IN THE WORKROOM, LAMY HAS GATHERED A GROUP TO WATCH A 1989 VIDEO OF JEAN-PAUL GOUDE&#39;S FRENCH REVOLUTION BICENTENNIAL PARADE ON A BATTERED TV. THE FLORIDA A &amp; M MARCHING BAND IS GETTING DOWN DANS LA RUE IN A BIG WAY.&nbsp; LAMY, A MEMBER OF THE HOLLYWOOD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, HAS THIS DREAM TO REMAKE THE HOLLYWOOD CHRISTMAS PARADE, A CHEESY CAVALCADE OF DREARY FLOATS AND B ACTORS, INTO SOMETHING WORLD CLASS.&nbsp; FORTUNE PIPES UP. &#39;&#39;ALL OF THIS, THE CAFE, RICK&#39;S CLOTHING, THIS VERY EVENING, IS ALL PART OF A MASTER PLAN TO TAKE OVER THE HOLLYWOOD CHRISTMAS PARADE.&#39;&#39; THE GROUP LAUGHS. IT PROBABLY IS.&nbsp; EVERYONE CROWDS AROUND THE TABLE, WHICH CONSISTS OF SEVERAL HEAVY DOORS SCAVENGED FROM THE ALLEY. CRATES SERVE AS EXTRA SEATS. BUT THERE WILL BE NO TOAST TONIGHT. INSTEAD, THERE ARE BABY LAMB CHOPS ON THE BONE, A VEGETABLE RAGOUT, COQ AU VIN AND A ROASTED BEET SALAD.&nbsp; &#39;&#39;I REMEMBER WHEN ALL THEY HAD WAS ONE HOT PLATE AND THEY WOULD COOK MUSSELS AND THEN MICHELE WOULD GO OVER TO MCDONALD&#39;S AND BUY BAGS AND BAGS OF FRENCH FRIES SO WE COULD HAVE MOULES ET FRITES,&#39;&#39; OBSERVES MICHAEL KAPLAN, A COSTUME DESIGNER. BUT TONIGHT IT IS SCALLOPS WITH THREE CAVIARS AND EVEN MORE CAVIAR IN A LARGE SCALLOP SHELL, AND, O.K., THERE IS SOME TOAST FOR THAT.&nbsp; MICHELE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY AND ANNOUNCES IN HER SMOKY VOICE, &#39;&#39;VAG IS HERE.&#39;&#39; BUT IT COMES OUT, &#39;&#39;VAAAHJ EEZ HEER.&#39;&#39;&nbsp; &#39;&#39;I REMEMBER BABY-SITTING FOR YOU,&#39;&#39; VAG TEASES THE NOW VERY SOPHISTICATED SCARLETT IN A QUASI FALSETTO. &#39;&#39;SHE&#39;S SO PERFECT NOW, BUT WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG, SHE WOULD GO ON!&#39;&#39;&nbsp; DOWN AT MICHELE&#39;S END OF THE TABLE, THEY ARE GOING ON ABOUT THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIZ TAYLOR FILM &#39;&#39;X,Y AND ZEE,&#39;&#39; WHICH EVERYONE HAS SEEN RECENTLY. KAPLAN IS DESCRIBING A FUN, NASTY BAR HE VISITED IN THE EAST VILLAGE ON A RECENT TRIP TO NEW YORK. &#39;&#39;I COULDN&#39;T BELIEVE WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE,&#39;&#39; HE OBSERVES. &#39;&#39;AND MY FRIEND WHO TOOK ME THERE ASKED ME, &#39;WHAT DO YOU THINK?&#39; ALL I COULD SAY WAS &#39;&#39;LOVE YOUR NEW MAYOR!&#39;&#39; EVERYONE LAUGHS.&nbsp; AND THE TALKING CONTINUES. A DULL ROAR. AS COOKIES AND COFFEE ARE SERVED, KAPLAN BREAKS OUT A BOTTLE OF ABSINTHE AND TAKES A SWIG. &#39;&#39;YECH! EET IS AWFUL!&#39;&#39; HE EXCLAIMS.&nbsp; OWENS ADMITS TO HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SHY AS A CHILD, AVOIDING SOCIAL CONTACT AT ALL COSTS, SO HE&#39;S VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE FRIENDS HE HAS MADE NOW. &#39;&#39;IT WAS SUCH AN ARDUOUS PROCESS FOR THE BOTH OF US.&#39;&#39; CERTAINLY LAMY IS MORE THE BUTTERFLY, THOUGH OWENS IS FAR FROM TACITURN. &#39;&#39;I&#39;M A LATE STARTER,&#39;&#39; HE EXPLAINS. &#39;&#39;I&#39;M JUST SO GRATEFUL; IT&#39;S ALREADY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.&#39;&#39;&nbsp; IN A CITY KNOWN FOR ITS HIT-AND-RUN DINNER PARTIES, WHERE EVERYONE IS IN BY 7 AND OUT BY 9, AT OWENS AND LAMY&#39;S THERE ARE STILL CONFIDENCES TO BE EXCHANGED, CHAMPAGNE TO BE SIPPED, COFFEE TO BE DRUNK, CIGARETTES TO BE SMOKED, COOKIES TO BE MUNCHED -- IT&#39;S ONLY 1 A.M., AFTER ALL.&nbsp; ROASTED BEET SALAD WITH HORSERADISH CR&Egrave;ME FRA&Icirc;CHE 16 TO 20 ORGANIC BABY BEETS, TRIMMED AND SCRUBBED 1 16-OUNCE HORSERADISH ROOT, SCRUBBED AND TRIMMED 1/2 CUP WALNUT OIL 1/2 CUP CHAMPAGNE VINEGAR 28-OUNCE CONTAINERS CR&Egrave;ME FRA&Icirc;CHE SALT AND PEPPER 4 CUPS ORGANIC BABY SPINACH, TRIMMED AND RINSED 4 WALNUT HALVES.&nbsp; 1.

WHO HASN&#39;T? IT&#39;S KIND OF DELICIOUS THAT A SYMBOL OF LEATHER BARS AND PUNK ROCK HAS BECOME AN ACCEPTABLE PART OF OUR CULTURE. I LOVE A HINT OF CORRUPTION. BUT OF COURSE THERE&#39;S THE ARTISANAL FACTOR. TO PRODUCE CLOTHES OUT OF LEATHER, EACH SKIN MUST BE HAND-CUT, UNLIKE METERS OF FABRIC THAT CAN BE STACKED AND CUT IN MULTIPLES. EACH SKIN IS UNIQUE AND THERE&#39;S GREAT APPEAL IN FEELING THAT HUMAN TOUCH. MY TAKE ON IT WAS TO MAKE IT DRAPE. KIND OF A BLEND OF IGGY AND MADAME GRES. IGGY GRES.&nbsp; WOULD YOU SAY IT&#39;S SOMETHING OF A RICK OWENS SIGNATURE?&nbsp; I&#39;M PLEASED THAT IT SEEMS TO HAVE ENDED UP THAT WAY.&nbsp; HOW IMPORTANT IS THE TACTILE NATURE OF LEATHER TO ITS APPEAL?&nbsp; LEATHER IS ONE OF THOSE MIRACLES OF NATURE THAT CAN&#39;T REALLY BE DUPLICATED. LIKE THE SMOOTHNESS OF MARBLE OR THE WARMTH OF WOOD, OR THE RICHNESS OF A FISTFUL OF EARTH.&nbsp; HOW IMPORTANT IS THE QUALITY OF THE LEATHER TO GIVE IT AN ELEMENT OF LUXURY?&nbsp; TO ME, SOMETIMES ALL THE PROCESSING IN THE PRESUMABLY HIGHER QUALITY LEATHERS SUCKS THE SOUL OUT OF IT.&nbsp; DO YOU THINK LEATHER CAN BE WORN BY WOMEN OF ALL AGES?&nbsp; HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE FAMOUS PICTURES OF MARLENE DIETRICH IN HER &#39;50S IN BLACK LEATHER PANTS AND TUNIC?&nbsp; WHAT CLASSIC LEATHER PIECES SHOULD EVERY WOMAN OWN?&nbsp; UH, BLACK LEATHER PANTS AND TUNIC. OH, AND A JACKET.&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOUR OWN EARLY MEMORIES OF LEATHER?&nbsp; WHEN CHROME HEARTS FIRST STARTED IN L.A.

IT&#39;S IN A BEAUX ARTS BUILDING WITH A GRAND STAIRCASE THAT GIVES THE WHOLE CONSUMER ORGY SOME DIGNITY AND DRAMA.&nbsp; I LIKE TO GO SEE MOVIES AT LA PAGODE IN THE 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT. IT USED TO BE A PRIVATE TEAHOUSE WITH EMBROIDERED PANELING INSIDE THE THEATRE THAT WAS PROTECTED BY CHAIN LINK DURING RECENT REFURBISHING. LOVED IT LIKE THAT.&nbsp; BEHIND THE MUSEE DES ARTS DECORATIFS, THERE&#39;S A RESTAURANT THAT JOINS THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES (LE SAUT DU LOUP). IT&#39;S RIGHT NEXT TO THE BUSHES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE GAY CRUISE CORNER OF THE JARDIN. VERY HANDY.&nbsp; I LOVE EVERY LADUREE. I THINK THERE&#39;S THREE OF THEM. BESIDES PERFECT VANILLA MACARONS IN BEAUTIFUL BOXES, YOU CAN GET THEIR CANDLES IN SCENTS LIKE BRIOCHE THAT ARE AMAZINGLY ACCURATE.&nbsp; BEST GALLERIES FOR FURNITURE ARE JOUSSE FOR 20TH CENTURY LIKE PROUVE, PERRIAND, ETC., AND ERIC DE SOMETHING FOR A BEAUTIFULLY EDITED SELECTION OF VINTAGE SWEDISH AND FRENCH STUFF.&nbsp; THE NEW CURATOR AT PALAIS DE TOKYO SEEMS FRESH.

HOW DO YOU DEFINE YOUR STYLE?&nbsp; ALTHOUGH I&#39;M TOO OLD TO BE REBELLIOUS, I&#39;M PRETTY COMFORTABLE BEING CONSIDERED &ldquo;FRINGE.&rdquo; I THINK I MAKE VERY PRAGMATIC CLOTHES THAT SEEM SUITABLE FOR THE TIMES WE LIVE IN. I TRY NOT TO MAKE THEM SCREAM &ldquo;FASHION,&rdquo; BUT THERE&#39;S DEFINITELY A ROMANTIC HINT OF FLAMBOYANCE. I ALWAYS LOVED EXTREME ARTIFICE, BUT LIKED THE IDEA OF BEING EVEN MORE SUBVERSIVE BY PROPOSING EXAGGERATION IN GREY AND SLIPPING IT INTO ALL DAY EVERY DAY, INSTEAD OF A &ldquo;DRESS-UP&rdquo; MOMENT.&nbsp; WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A COLLECTION OR EVEN JUST ONE PIECE OF CLOTHING, WHAT INSPIRES YOU? DO YOU TAKE IDEAS FROM MUSIC OR FILM?&nbsp; I TRY NOT TO ISOLATE A MOOD TOO MUCH, BUT TO FEEL AN ACCUMULATIVE AESTHETIC INSTEAD THAT I&#39;VE COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS. PART OF THAT COLLECTION WOULD INCLUDE BRANCUSI, BEUYS, FASSBINDER, WAGNER, JEAN MICHEL-FRANK, RHULMANN, COLANI, DE MONTESQUIOU. I&#39;M VERY FAITHFUL TO MY INFLUENCES.&nbsp; I PROBABLY LOOK AT ARCHITECTURE BOOKS MORE THAN FASHION BOOKS, AND MY FAVORITE MAGAZINE IS WORLD OF INTERIORS. I USUALLY FIND A LINE OR PROPORTION WHEN I THINK OF A FIGURE IN A SPACE, OR AN ARCHITECTURAL LINE ON A BODY. I ENJOY THE TECHNICAL PATTERNMAKING PROCESS OF DESIGNING THE MOST.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE PIECE OF CLOTHING THAT YOU LIKE TO DESIGN THE MOST?&nbsp; I PROBABLY LIKE THE ARCHITECTURE OF JACKETS THE MOST; BESIDES, I THINK OF THEM AS LUGGAGE. I LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE FLUID AND SIMPLE, WITH THE LINE OF YOUR CLOTHES FALLING FROM A JACKET WITH A GOOD SHOULDER, AND PLENTY OF POCKETS SO YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO CARRY A PURSE. NOT CARRYING A PURSE SEEMS LIKE THE ULTIMATE CONFIDENT FREEDOM TO ME.&nbsp; HOW DOES THE CREATION PROCESS HAPPEN FOR YOU?&nbsp; I&#39;M USED TO BEING ALONE A LOT, AND TAKE A NAP EVERY AFTERNOON AFTER THE GYM AND LUNCH. I USUALLY SORT MY THOUGHTS AFTER WAKING UP (BOTH TIMES) AND SPEND THE REST OF THE TIME TRYING TO GET THEM EXECUTED. THE GYM IS GREAT FOR DEVELOPING IDEAS, BECAUSE I&#39;M SO DISTRACTED BY EXERTION AND SUPER-LOUD MUSIC ON MY IPOD THAT I DON&#39;T OVERANALYZE THINGS TOO MUCH. AND IT PUTS ME IN A PRIMITIVE, SIMPLISTIC MOOD THAT CARVES IDEAS MORE CRUDELY, THE WAY I LIKE THEM.&nbsp; WHAT KIND OF FABRICS DO YOU PREFER THE MOST, AND WHY?&nbsp; I LIKE THE LIMPEST JERSEYS AND LEATHERS THAT FEEL LIKE THEY&#39;VE BEEN THROUGH YEARS OF LOVE. BUT RECENTLY I&#39;VE ALSO BEEN USING A LOT OF &quot;COUTURE&quot; FABRICS LIKE GAZARS AND ORGANDIES (WASHED, OF COURSE) TO GET A MORE EXAGGERATED, &ldquo;MERINGUE&rdquo; SILHOUETTE.&nbsp; WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE DRESSING EVERY DAY?&nbsp; WHATEVER MAKES THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT. I DON&#39;T LIKE RULES, AND I DON&#39;T SUGGEST THEM.&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE?&nbsp; I&#39;M GOING TO THE STATES (NYC) FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 5 YEARS IN OCTOBER TO ACCEPT SOME FASHION AWARDS.

YOU SEEM TO WORK ON SHAPES AND AESTHETIC, RATHER THAN &ldquo;FASHION.&rdquo; DO YOU AGREE? ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE ACHIEVED YOUR OWN FASHION AESTHETIC, EVEN CONSIDERING (IN SOME VIEWS) THAT YOUR WORK AS REPETITIVE?&nbsp; WHENEVER I FIND MYSELF GETTING DISTRACTED OR INDECISIVE, I LOOK AT BRANCUSI&#39;S WORK. THERE&#39;S SUCH A STRONG, PURE VISION THAT&#39;S CONSISTENT AND PERSONAL. ALMOST OBSESSIVE. I APPRECIATE THE WHIMSY AND JOY IN CREATORS THAT EXPERIMENT AND FLY OFF INTO OTHER DIRECTIONS, BUT I CHOSE A VERY STRAIGHT PATH FOR MYSELF, FOR BETTER OR WORSE. I WAS ALWAYS MORE INTERESTED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLOTHES THAN THE MESSAGE OF CLOTHES. BUT THAT&#39;S JUST ME. I SEE PEOPLE DOING CONCEPT CLOTHES THAT I ADMIRE A LOT. THERE WAS A TIME THAT DESIGNERS HAD A PERSONAL VOCABULARY. VIONNET, GRES AND ALAIA COME TO MY MIND MOST. I&#39;M ATTRACTED TO THAT KIND OF FOCUS AND PACE.&nbsp; YOUR CLOTHES ARE LIKE A BIOGRAPHY, REFLECTING YOUR IMAGINARY AND REAL WORLD. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THEM (THE FALL/WINTER SHOW, FOR INSTANCE, OR IN GENERAL)?&nbsp; I DON&#39;T HAVE AN IMAGINARY WORLD. I TRY TO PUT MY REAL WORLD ON THE RUNWAY. THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS IN THE PAST WHEN I SLIPPED; WHEN I WASN&#39;T AS FOCUSED. BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO.&nbsp; THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE FALL RUNWAY THAT WON&#39;T BE FOR SALE IN MY STORE. OR THAT I DON&#39;T CONSIDER A SERIOUS PROPOSAL ON MY PART. GRANTED, MY IDEAS AREN&#39;T EVERYONE&#39;S CUP OF TEA, BUT THE PROPOSALS ARE GENUINE.&nbsp; I&#39;VE ALWAYS LIKED IT WHEN THE BARBARIC TURNS ELEGANT. AND WHEN IT&#39;S DONE QUIETLY AND CONTROLLED. WITH MY LAST 4 COLLECTIONS I FEEL THAT I&#39;M GETTING CLOSER TO EXPRESSING THAT WITH FEWER MISTAKES.&nbsp; DO YOU FEEL A CONNECTION WITH THE LOS ANGELES/LARRY CLARK SUBCULTURE AESTHETIC? DO YOU HAVE HEROES, OR DO YOU ONLY TRUST YOUR EYES? H&Egrave;L&Euml;NE TOLD ME YOU LIVED IN THE STREET FOR SOMETIME, CHANGING HAIR COLOUR EVERY OTHER DAY, BEFORE MEETING MICHELE.&nbsp; I&#39;M AFRAID I WAS JUST A CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLICHE REACTING AGAINST UNEXCITING MORALITY AND LOOKING FOR EXOTIC SIN. BUT I&#39;VE FORGIVEN MYSELF FOR BEING SO PREDICTABLE; THAT&#39;S WHAT YOU&#39;RE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH YOUR YOUTH.&nbsp; I WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTED TO RECKLESS HEROES, BURNING OUT IN A BLAZE OF GLORY. LIKE BRUNHILDE&#39;S IMMOLATION. THAT WAS THE ENVIRONMENT I PURSUED IN L.A. BUT THEN I REALIZED I MIGHT HAVE MORE OPTIONS. I LOOK BACK ON THAT PERIOD WITH GREAT AFFECTION, THOUGH. I WAS VERY THOROUGH.&nbsp; HOW DID YOU CONSIDER FASHION THEN?&nbsp; I HAD A VERY LARGE NOSE RING WITH A CHAIN TO MY EAR AND ALWAYS WORE HEAVY MAKEUP: CHANEL BASE IN BISQUE, AND POWDER. I PENCILED MY EYEBROWS GOING BACK IN A POINT. I WAS TRYING TO BE A CROSS BETWEEN A THIERRY MUGLER ALIEN AND KLAUS NOMI. I LIVED IN A FRIEND&#39;S WAREHOUSE THAT WAS ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY AN OUTDOOR FIRE ESCAPE. I WORE PLATFORMS, GLOVES AND CAPES. BLACK BLACK BLACK. I HAD A WONDERFUL &#39;50S DODGE WITH TAIN FINS, LOADED WITH WAGNER AND SISTERS OF MERCY CASSETTES. I WISH I HAD PICTURES BUT DIDN&#39;T THINK OF IT THEN AND CAN&#39;T FIND ANY.&nbsp; I&#39;M INTRIGUED BY THE TIME YOU WOKE UP WITH DONNA SUMMER MUSIC AND COCAINE EVERY DAY. WAS IT FUN?&nbsp; OF COURSE IT WAS FUN. EVERYONE KNOWS IT WAS FUN. BUT THEN IT BECAME MORE TROUBLE THAN IT WAS WORTH, AND I MOVED ON TO DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. MAYBE WHEN I RETIRE I&#39;LL GO BACK TO IT.&nbsp; HOW DID YOU MEET MICHELE, AND HOW DO YOU WORK TOGETHER?&nbsp; SOMEONE I WAS SEEING INTRODUCED US AND I ENDED UP LEAVING HIM AND GOING WITH HER. WE&#39;VE BEEN TOGETHER 15 YEARS NOW AND HAVE GONE THROUGH DIFFERENT STAGES. WHEN WE WERE FIRST TOGETHER, SHE STARTED A VERY GLAMOROUS RESTAURANT AND I STARTED MY COLLECTION. WE LIVED IN MY STUDIO AND WERE STARTING BOTH PROJECTS FROM ZERO, SO IT WAS A TRADITIONAL STRUGGLING HONEYMOON. WE&#39;RE PROBABLY BOTH VERY DRIVEN, BUT TOGETHER WE PROBABLY FUELED EACH OTHER&#39;S FEROCITY. IT WAS GREAT. THEN I GOT A DEAL TO WORK IN EUROPE, SHE NEEDED A CHANGE, AND HERE WE ARE. SHE HAS VISION AND MAINTAINS OUR STANDARDS. IN WORK AND IN LIFESTYLE. I ENJOY THE EVERYDAY MACHINATIONS OF BUILDING A BRAND.&nbsp; HOW DID YOU FIRST USE BIAS CUT, MAKING GODDESS DRESSES IN THE MADELEINE VIONNET SPIRIT? AND HOW DID YOU FIRST TRANSLATE THESE LINES IN JERSEY?&nbsp; MY BEST-SELLING BIAS SKIRT WAS FIRST MADE ON A MANNEQUIN IN THE LIVING ROOM OF OUR SUITE AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT WHERE WE WERE LIVING AT THE TIME. I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO MAKE COUTURE SILHOUETTES WITH THE EASE AND FAMILIARITY OF T-SHIRTS. I WANTED TO DRAG SPECIAL-OCCASION CLOTHES INTO EVERY DAY. IT WAS MY FORM OF SUBVERSION TO TRY TO MAKE SKIRTS WITH A TRAIN LOOK COOL AT THE BEACH AND AT THE SUPERMARKET. MAKING T-SHIRTS MIX WITH EVENING WASN&#39;T EXACTLY A NEW IDEA. CHANEL HAD DONE IT, RUDI GERNREICH HAD DONE IT, NORMA KAMALI HAD DONE IT. BUT THEY DID IT WITH THEIR OWN IDENTITY, AND I THINK I HAVE WITH MINE NOW. HOW DO YOU WORK?&nbsp; I&#39;VE BUILT A FOUNDATION OF SHAPES IN WHICH I FIND A NEW LINE TO EXAGGERATE OR OBSESS OVER. I CARRY INDEX CARDS IN MY POCKET AT ALL TIMES AND, ESPECIALLY AT THE GYM, OR AFTER A NAP, I MAKE NOTES AND ROUGH SKETCHES OF THINGS THAT PASS THROUGH MY HEAD. WHEN IT&#39;S TIME TO START A NEW COLLECTION, I COLLATE MY CARDS AND MAKE A COLLECTION OUT OF IT. THEN I WORK ON THE PATTERNS AND FIT ON A MODEL WITH THE TOILES.&nbsp; YOU OFTEN QUOTE YOUR OWN STYLE AS &ldquo;DRAMA QUEEN&rdquo; WHICH USUALLY REFERS MORE TO SEQUINS THAN THE VERY SIMPLE SHAPES AND MATERIALS YOU USE. AREN&#39;T YOU MORE OF A MODERNIST THAN A DRAMA QUEEN?&nbsp; WHEN I REFER TO A DRAMA QUEEN, I&#39;M REFERRING TO EGOTISTICAL AND HISTRIONIC TEMPERAMENT AS IN AN OPERA DIVA SINGING WITH A SCARF IN ONE HAND AND A KNIFE IN THE OTHER ON A BARE WOODEN STAGE.&nbsp; YOU&#39;VE SHOWN CLOTHES FOR MEN AND WOMEN, USING SOME IDENTICAL SHAPES OR MATERIALS. IS THERE STILL A DIFFERENCE, OR A FENCE BETWEEN THE TWO, IN YOUR APPROACH?&nbsp; YES. WITH WOMEN, I THINK IN A PHYSICAL WAY, FINDING NEW WAYS TO CARESS A BODY WITH LINES AND DRAPING OF FABRIC. WITH MEN, I&#39;M MORE INTERESTING IN PROJECTING DIGNITY AND VIRILITY. MAYBE I EMBRACE WOMEN AND OBJECTIFY MEN?

AS EASILY AS THE FRENCH TOOK TO STARBUCKS, IPODS AND NIKE, THEY STILL STAND READY TO PULL UP THE CULTURAL DRAWBRIDGE AT ANY SIGN THAT THEIR GALLIC ESSENCE IS IN JEOPARDY. SO IT&rsquo;S INTERESTING TO NOTE THE SUCCESS AND INCREASING IMPORTANCE ON THE SCENE OF AN AMERICAN DESIGNER LIKE RICK OWENS, A CALIFORNIAN WHO IN SOME WAYS IS AS HOMEGROWN A COMMODITY AS THE BURGERS, JEANS AND POPCORN MOVIES THAT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT, NICOLAS SARKOZY, WHOM HIS CRITICS DERIDE AS &ldquo;SARKO THE AMERICAN,&rdquo; PRAISES LAVISHLY.&nbsp; MR. OWENS, WHO MADE HIS NAME CUTTING CLOTHES FOR ROCK STARS, AND WAS UNEXPECTEDLY ADOPTED BY ANNA WINTOUR AND THE EAST COAST FASHION ESTABLISHMENT (HE WON A PERRY ELLIS AWARD FOR EMERGING TALENT FROM THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA IN 2002), HAD A SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH CAREER IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT IT WAS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE CULT STATUS HE ENJOYS IN FRANCE.&nbsp; FRENCH CRITICS LAUD MR. OWENS&rsquo;S CHALLENGING DESIGNS. FRENCH EDITORS PHOTOGRAPH THEM ALL CONSTANTLY. FRENCH WOMEN BUY THEM WITH RELIGIOUS FERVOR, AND HIS CLOTHES REMAIN BIG SELLERS IN UPSCALE DEPARTMENT STORES LIKE LE BON MARCH&Eacute; AND SPECIALTY BOUTIQUES LIKE MARIA LUISA, OWNED BY THE INFLUENTIAL STOREKEEPER MARIA LUISA POUMAILLOU.&nbsp; THE COLLECTION MR. OWENS SHOWED SUNDAY NIGHT IN A GALLERY AT THE &Eacute;COLE DES BEAUX-ARTS GOT PARIS FASHION WEEK OFF TO A STRONG START WITH ITS ASSURED GEOMETRIES AND DISCIPLINED SILHOUETTE. YET IT IS NOT JUST HIS DESIGN SKILLS THAT ALLY HIM WITH THE OTHER FASCINATING AMERICAN CHARACTERS WHO IMMIGRATED TO PARIS TO FIND THEMSELVES. IT IS HIS BIOGRAPHY.&nbsp; PLENTY OF DESIGNERS SELL WELL AT MARIA LUISA AND COLETTE. TOO MANY DESIGNERS RETAIL A HIPSTER POSE THAT HAS TRULY SEEN BETTER DAYS. NO DESIGNER THAT ONE CAN THINK OF, HOWEVER, CAN CLAIM A BACK STORY ANYTHING LIKE MR. OWENS&rsquo;S, STARTING WITH HIS BOYHOOD IN PORTERVILLE, AN AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY IN THE CALIFORNIA ORANGE BELT.&nbsp; &ldquo;HE DIDN&rsquo;T HAVE A TELEVISION GROWING UP,&rdquo; HIS FATHER, JOHN, A RETIRED SOCIAL WORKER, SAID BACKSTAGE AT THE SHOW. &ldquo;I THINK THAT HAD A LOT OF EFFECT ON HIS RESOURCEFULNESS.&rdquo;&nbsp; OR IT COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN THE LESSONS HIS FATHER DRUMMED INTO HIM ABOUT THE CONFUCIAN ANALECTS AND THE MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS AND HIS ATTEMPTS TO TEACH YOUNG RICK WILDERNESS SKILLS AND HOW TO SHOOT A COLT .45. &ldquo;THAT DIDN&rsquo;T TAKE PARTICULARLY,&rdquo; HE SAID.&nbsp; OF COURSE, IT WAS, AS USUAL, HIS FLIGHT FROM HOME THAT MOST CLEARLY MARKED HIM AS AN AMERICAN, A HAPHAZARD HEGIRA THAT TOOK HIM TO NEW YORK TO STUDY ART AT PARSONS; THEN TO PATTERNMAKER SCHOOL; THEN TO LOS ANGELES, WHERE HE DID JOURNEYMAN WORK FOR LABELS THAT KNOCKED OFF OSCAR GOWNS; THEN TO MEET AND MARRY MICHELE LAMY, A CHARISMATIC AND VISUALLY ECCENTRIC FRENCHWOMAN WHO RAN A HOT HOLLYWOOD NIGHTSPOT CALLED LES DEUX CAFES; THEN TO TAKE DRUGS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND IN QUANTITIES; THEN TO BECOME SOBER AND START A BUSINESS UNDER HIS OWN NAME; THEN TO WIN THE C.F.D.A. AWARD; AND, IN 2003, TO FIND HIMSELF NAMED THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF REVILLON FR&Egrave;RES, THE FRENCH FURRIER.&nbsp; &ldquo;THERE&rsquo;S A GENERATION THAT DRANK AND SMOKED TOO MUCH AND TOOK TOO MANY DRUGS,&rdquo; MR. OWENS ONCE TOLD ME. &ldquo;I&rsquo;M FROM THAT GENERATION. THERE ARE SO MANY OF US.&rdquo;&nbsp; WELL, ACTUALLY, THERE AREN&rsquo;T, SINCE QUITE A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE RICK OWENS WORKED WITH AND PARTIED WITH HAVE DIED. HE HAS BEEN SOBER FOR YEARS. HE WORKS OUT WITH THE FANATICISM HE ONCE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON DESIGNING, SAY, THE TOGAS FOR A LEGENDARY ART/SEX-CLUB INSTALLATION ORGANIZED IN THE &rsquo;90S BY RON ATHEY AND VAGINAL DAVIS AT A SEEDY LOS ANGELES MOTEL.&nbsp; &ldquo;IF THAT ISN&rsquo;T GLAM, I DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHAT IS,&rdquo; MR.

DAVIS&rsquo;S NEW PERFORMANCE PIECE) AND THE RAUNCHY ART-HOUSE FILMMAKER BRUCE LABRUCE, AND ALSO CATER TO THE COUTURE CROWD THAT SEEMS TO SET MR. OWENS APART.

I BECAME A CONDUCTOR THAT THAT ENERGY WENT THROUGH.&nbsp; THAT BEING SAID, I NEVER CREATED MICHELE. SHE&#39;S A POWERFUL FORCE OF NATURE THAT I JUST OFFER SACRIFICES TO SO SHE WON&#39;T HURT ME. I WOULD NEVER PRESUME TO SELECT OR ARRANGE ANY OF HER JEWELRY, BUT SOMETIMES I&#39;M THERE FOR THE MOMENT OF DISCOVERY WHEN SHE FINDS SOMETHING THAT MUST BELONG TO HER.&nbsp; SHE WAS ALWAYS IN LOVE WITH THAT GUY WITH THE GOLD FRONT TEETH FROM &quot;BELLE DE JOUR,&quot; AND THEN SNOOP DOGG. SO OF COURSE SHE HAD HER FRONT TEETH DONE AS SOON AS SHE HAD THE EXCUSE.&nbsp; SO I SUPPOSE THOSE TEETH WOULD BE THE CLOSEST THING I HAVE TO A PERSONAL AMULET.

SARAH MOWER SPECULATES.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IF YOU HAVE A SMALL, TIGHT SHOULDER AND LONG, SKINNY ARMS, IT SETS THE HEAD OFF REALLY GRACEFULLY,&rdquo; SAYS RICK OWENS. &ldquo;ONCE YOU HAVE THAT, IT GETS THE EYE FIXED, AND THEN YOU GET AN IMPRESSION OF LENGTH AND GRACE FLOWING DOWN FROM THAT. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT FLOWING RATHER THAN GRIPPING.&rdquo;&nbsp; OWENS, WHO IS FITTING GEORGINA GRENVILLE (THE MODEL WHO DEFINED THE COLUMNAR FORMS OF GUCCI IN THE NINETIES) INTO A SLITHER OF BIAS SATIN AND A LUXE MINK BOLERO FROM HIS NEW PALAIS ROYAL FUR LABEL, IS DESCRIBING HIS &ldquo;DRIPPY&rdquo; SILHOUETTE. HIS TEMPLATE&ndash; FLUID AS IT MAY BE&ndash; IS A FIXED POINT IN THE LONG-DRAWN-OUT WOMAN&rsquo;S UNIVERSE. I HAD RUNG HIM FOR A COUNSELING AFTER I WAS AWOKEN ONE MORNING BY A FRIEND, R., CALLING DURING RESORT SHOWS IN NEW YORK. &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T YOU THINK IT&rsquo;S GOING FIFTIES?&rdquo; SHE ASKED. &ldquo;BIG SKIRTS, SMALL WAIST? CALL UP VOGUE.COM, PRADA. SEE?&rdquo; SHE WAS RIGHT. BALLERINA-LENGTH. DIRNDL-ISH. FEMININE. IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED, FRIDA GIANNINI AT GUCCI AND DONNA KAREN PUT BIG SKIRTS IN THEIR RESORT COLLECTIONS, TOO. AND WHEN NEW YORK SPRING SHOWS HIT, THEY WERE IN BREAKOUT MODE AT DONNA, ANNE KLEIN, AND OSCAR. (GRANTED, THEY&rsquo;RE USUALLY SOMEWHERE AT OSCAR.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I FIND THAT KIND OF RUDE, LIKE YOU&rsquo;RE NOT THE RIGHT SHAPE,&rdquo; SAYS OWENS, WHO RECENTLY WON A NATIONAL DESIGN AWARD FOR FASHION. &ldquo;I ALWAYS THINK IT&rsquo;S MORE POLITE TO LET FABRIC FLOW OVER CURVES.&rdquo;&nbsp; QUITE. NIP ME IN THE PLACE WHERE A WAIST SHOULD BE, KEEP IT FLARING ON OUT, AND I&rsquo;M A VAST-HIPPED BLOB. QUEEN CELESTE IN BABAR, NOT THE YOUNG PRINCESS MARGARET IN CHRISTIAN DIOR CIRCA 1953, WHOSE IMAGE I SEE BEHIND THOSE PRADA RESORT FLORALS. TIME WAS, THIS WOULD&rsquo;VE MEANT STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF ANOTHER SPELL IN FASHION EXILE FOR WOMEN LIKE ME. WHEN MIUCCIA LAST GOT UP TO HER INEXORABLY INFLUENTIAL SKIRT-INFLATING TRICKS IN HER 2004 &ldquo;FIFTIES LADY TOURIST IN ITALY&rdquo; PHASE, I WAS LOST. THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE.&nbsp; BUT SOMETHING ELSE IS HAPPENING. WHERE R. WAS SEEING CIRCLE SKIRTS, I SAW NARROWNESS. LOOK AT L&rsquo;WREN SCOTT: SHE HAS THE GLAMOUR-SKINNY DOWN, NOT JUST IN HER LICORICE-STICK PANTS AND ANKLE-GRAZING COATS BUT IN DRESSES THAT REMIND US THAT THE FIFTIES WERE ALSO ABOUT COCKTAIL SHEATHS TO THE CALF. THERE IS HOPE IN THE DAY SIDE OF RESORT&rsquo;S NINA RICCI, TOO: THOSE SLINKY DRESSES AND TRAILY PANTS BY OLIVIER THEYSKENS.&nbsp; IT&rsquo;S A STRANGE MOMENT BECAUSE WHEN IT BOILS DOWN TO IT, WIDE AND SKINNY ARE NOT JUST POLES APART AESTHETICALLY BUT PHILOSOPHICAL OPPOSITES, AND NOW WE&rsquo;VE COME TO A FACE-OFF BETWEEN THE TWO. BIG SKIRTS ARE HAPPY SKIRTS FOR THE DAINTY, WHIRLING OUT OF THE UNIVERSE OF FANTASY CHRISTIAN DIOR IMAGINED FOR THE POST-WWII WOMAN. THEY IMPLY CORSETS, ARTIFICE, THE DECORATIVE LADY&ndash; DORIS DAY FOR AMERICA. LONG-SKINNINESS IS ROOTED IN COOL, EDGY REALISM, THE TRADITION THAT WINDS BACK THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND ROCK CULTURE TO (AS OWENS POINTS OUT) THE SOCIAL LIBERATORS OF EARLY MODERN DESIGN, MADELEINE VIONNET AND MARIANO FORTUNY. (&ldquo;THERE WAS NO ONE MORE PUNK ROCK THAN THEM!&rdquo;)&nbsp; AND NOW, INTERESTINGLY, THE REALLY YOUNG ARE ON THE CASE. ALEXA ADAMS AND FLORA GILL OF OHNE TITEL ARE TAILORING PENCIL-THIN SLEEVES INTO HIP-SKIMMING JACKETS AND ELONGATING TROUSERS TO BRUSH THE GROUND. &ldquo;FOR US, THE LONG, LEAN, SKINNY PANT-AND-JACKET SILHOUETTE CONNECTS WITH THE FEMALE BODY AND SIGNIFIES A CERTAIN SHAPE CONFIDENCE,&rdquo; SAYS ADAMS. &ldquo;FOR OUR GENERATION, THIS IS A WHOLE NEW IDEA OF SUITING.&rdquo;&nbsp; FOR THE STOP-PRESS ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ALL UP TO, THOUGH, I SAY WE SHOULD TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE MULLEAVY SISTERS AT RODARTE. IN THEIR LATEST COLLECTION, SKINNY PANTS AND VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS COEXIST. TO THEM, THERE&rsquo;S NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE TWO SILHOUETTES, AND NO WEDDEDNESS TO THE TRADITIONAL VALUES OF ONE OR THE OTHER. THEY JUST SIT HAPPILY SIDE BY SIDE. AND THAT, I BELIEVE, SUMS UP THE SITUATION AS WE RUN FORWARD INTO NEXT SPRING. R. AND I CAN BOTH FEEL RIGHT, AND ON IT, WHILE WEARING PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE THING. SHE CAN SHOW OFF HER TINY ANKLES IN SWISHY SKIRTS, AND I CAN MAKE THE MOST OF MY BIG SHOULDERS SLOUCHING ROUND IN PANTS. WE&rsquo;LL ALL WEAR WHAT SUITS US, AND IT DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER. AS MY DAUGHTERS CONSTANTLY SAY, &ldquo;WELL DUH, MOMMY.&rdquo; I WONDER WHY I PANICKED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

IT WAS TWO DAYS BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF FASHION WEEK, AND VALENTINE, WHO HAD BEEN SELECTED BY OWENS AS A FIT MODEL, WOULD SPEND THE MORNING TRYING ON GARMENTS FROM HIS SPRING 2008 COLLECTION, WHICH WAS TO BE PRESENTED AT THE ECOLE NATIONALE SUPERIEURE DES BEAUX-ARTS ON SUNDAY. OWENS HAS BEEN SHOWING HIS LABEL ON THE RUNWAY FOR JUST SIX YEARS, BUT SINCE THE LATE NINETIES STYLISH WOMEN&mdash;INCLUDING HELENA BONHAM CARTER, ELLEN BARKIN, ANGELINA JOLIE, AND (LATELY) THE OLSEN TWINS&mdash;HAVE BEEN WEARING HIS LONG, CLINGY T-SHIRTS, ELEGANTLY ASYMMETRICAL DRESSES, AND SKINNY-ARMED LEATHER JACKETS, WHICH ARE IN CONSTANT DEMAND AT BARNEYS. OWENS, A FORTY-SIX-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIA NATIVE, WHOSE DECEPTIVELY CASUAL DESIGNS COMBINE LUXURY FABRICS&mdash;OSTRICH, GAZAR, ORGANZA, AND PLEATED EELSKIN&mdash;WITH METICULOUS, HIGHLY UNCONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION, HAS BECOME THE FOREMOST PURVEYOR OF WHAT HE HAS CALLED &ldquo;GLUNGE&rdquo; (GRUNGE PLUS GLAMOUR). HE HAS ACQUIRED A FOLLOWING THAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS CULTLIKE OR EXCLUSIVE, WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT HE SELLS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS&rsquo; WORTH OF CLOTHES EACH YEAR, IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HIGH-END FASHION STORES AROUND THE WORLD. THIS SUMMER, HE WILL OPEN A BOUTIQUE IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN, HIS FIRST IN THE UNITED STATES. VALENTINE GLANCED AROUND NERVOUSLY AS SHE ENTERED OWENS&rsquo;S BUILDING, A STAID, NEOCLASSICAL PILE THAT HE AND HIS WIFE, MICHELE LAMY, WHO IS FRENCH, BOUGHT IN 2004. FRAN&Ccedil;OIS MITTERRAND ONCE HAD AN OFFICE ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THE INTERIOR, HOWEVER, SUGGESTS A GUT DEMOLITION IN PROGRESS, THOUGH IT HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AS MUCH OF A MAKEOVER AS OWENS INTENDS, SINCE HE LIKES TO WORK IN SURROUNDINGS THAT REFLECT HIS AESTHETIC OF&mdash;AS HE HAS PUT IT&mdash;&ldquo;BROKEN IDEALISM.&rdquo; EXCEPT FOR SOME WEDDING-CAKE MOLDINGS IN A FEW ROOMS, INCLUDING MITTERRAND&rsquo;S FORMER OFFICE, HE HAS STRIPPED THE PLACE OF ITS ORIGINAL DETAILS. THE WALLS, SHORN OF WALLPAPER, ARE CRUMBLING; THE FLOORS ARE DUSTY CONCRETE SLABS; AND THE CEILINGS ARE A TANGLE OF DUCTS, WIRES, AND PIPES. ON THE TOP FLOOR ARE OWENS AND LAMY&rsquo;S LIVING QUARTERS: A CAVERNOUS ROOM FURNISHED WITH AN ARMCHAIR, A TV SCREEN MOUNTED ON A BLACK PLYWOOD CUBE, AND A BED, DESIGNED BY OWENS, WITH A U- SHAPED, SIX-FOOT-HIGH HEADBOARD UPHOLSTERED IN BROWN WOOL FELT&mdash;A SAMPLE FROM HIS FURNITURE COLLECTION, WHICH HE WOULD BE PRESENTING TO THE PUBLIC AT A PARIS ART GALLERY THE FOLLOWING WEEK. AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ROOM WAS A SHOWER: A CONCRETE PLATFORM WITH A DRAIN IN THE CENTER AND NO WALLS. VALENTINE MET OWENS IN HIS THIRD-FLOOR STUDIO, A LONG, LOW ROOM WITH WINDOWS COVERED BY SWISS ARMY BLANKETS, BROKEN CEILING BEAMS, AND FIVE RACKS OF CLOTHES, WHICH HAD ARRIVED THAT MORNING FROM THE FACTORY IN ITALY WHERE OWENS&rsquo;S LABEL IS PRODUCED. ON A TABLE AT ONE END OF THE ROOM, A LAPTOP WAS PLAYING THE RAMONES SONG &ldquo;NOW I WANNA SNIFF SOME GLUE.&rdquo; OWENS, WHO WAS EYING THE RACKS WHEN VALENTINE ARRIVED, WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES THAT HE HAD DESIGNED: A SLEEVELESS BLACK T-SHIRT MADE OF FRAYING SILK (EXPOSING GYM-PUMPED ARMS, ADORNED IN TATTOOS), BAGGY BLACK SHORTS, AND, BENEATH THE SHORTS, GRAY SWEATPANTS WITH INSIDE-OUT SEAMS, THE RAGGED ENDS TUCKED INTO UNLACED, HANDSEWN, LEATHER HIGH-TOPS, WHICH SELL FOR TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. LONG STRAIGHT HAIR, DYED BLACK, FRAMED HIS FACE, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY LARGE DARK EYES; HE LOOKS UNCANNILY LIKE IGGY POP. ONCE, WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY AN INTERVIEWER TO NAME HIS &ldquo;TEENAGE DESIRE,&rdquo; OWENS, WHO IS BISEXUAL, REPLIED, &ldquo;TO F CK IGGY POP.&rdquo; HAVING FAILED IN THAT GOAL&mdash;&ldquo;I MET IGGY ONLY ONCE,&rdquo; HE TOLD ME, &ldquo;IN A TACKY MEXICAN DRAG BAR IN L.A.: A LITTLE, SHRIVELLED, UGLY GUY ON THE DANCE FLOOR WITH AN ASIAN WOMAN. BUT THAT&rsquo;S THE WAY TO MEET HIM&rdquo;&mdash;OWENS DID HIS BEST, HE EXPLAINED, &ldquo;TO TURN INTO IGGY POP.&rdquo; THIS AMBITION EXTENDED BEYOND STRAIGHTENING AND DYING HIS HAIR, WHICH IS NATURALLY CURLY AND PREMATURELY WHITE. LIKE IGGY, FOR MANY YEARS OWENS INDULGED IN DRUGS AND ALCOHOL (MOSTLY SPEED, COCAINE, AND VODKA), IN AMOUNTS THAT, BEFORE HE STOPPED COLD TURKEY, IN THE EARLY NINETIES, NEARLY KILLED HIM. HE IMMEDIATELY PUT VALENTINE AT EASE. &ldquo;IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME DOING THE PARIS SHOWS?&rdquo; HE ASKED. SHE SAID THAT IT WAS.&nbsp; &ldquo;ARE PEOPLE NICE TO YOU?&rdquo; HE ASKED. &ldquo;WELL, THE DESIGNERS TEND TO BE AWFULLY BUSY AND THEY SEE A LOT OF GIRLS,&rdquo; SHE REPLIED. &ldquo;YEAH,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. &ldquo;THEY CAN BE SO DISMISSIVE.&rdquo; A FEW MOMENTS LATER, VALENTINE EMERGED FROM THE FITTING ROOM WEARING A GAUZY TUNIC WITH A FOLDED NECKLINE DESIGNED TO STAND AWAY FROM THE NAPE, BUT SHE HAD PUT THE GARMENT ON BACKWARD. &ldquo;YOU KNOW, IT ACTUALLY LOOKS SORTA GOOD THAT WAY,&rdquo; OWENS SAID SOFTLY. SHE REAPPEARED IN A LONG BLACK SKIRT, AND OWENS KNELT IN FRONT OF HER TO ADJUST THE UNFINISHED HEM. &ldquo;GEE,&rdquo; HE SAID, LOOKING UP. &ldquo;ARE YOU EXTRA TALL?&rdquo; &ldquo;NO,&rdquo; SHE SAID. &ldquo;ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-ONE CENTIMETRES&rdquo;&mdash;THAT IS, ABOUT FIVE FEET ELEVEN INCHES, STANDARD FOR A MODEL.&nbsp; &ldquo;SO YOU&rsquo;RE NOT A FREAK,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. &ldquo;NO! THANK YOU,&rdquo; SHE SAID. &ldquo;OH, YES, YOU ARE,&rdquo; HE COUNTERED. SHE FLUSHED AND FROWNED, FAILING TO COMPREHEND THAT, FOR OWENS, &ldquo;FREAK&rdquo; IS A COMPLIMENT OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.&nbsp; OWENS HAS BUILT A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS OUT OF A TALENT FOR INFUSING GARMENTS WITH THE POIGNANT BEAUTY THAT RESIDES IN IMPERFECTION. COURTNEY LOVE, THE LEAD SINGER OF HOLE, WAS AMONG THE FIRST CELEBRITIES TO DISCOVER OWENS, IN THE LATE NINETIES, SHORTLY AFTER HE LAUNCHED HIS LABEL, WHICH CONSISTED MAINLY OF MACHINE-WASHED LEATHER JACKETS, THREADBARE CASHMERE T-SHIRTS, AND ARTFULLY FRAYED HOODIES. &ldquo;HE WAS SO IDIOSYNCRATIC AND SUCH AN ICONOCLAST&mdash; EARLY,&rdquo; LOVE SAYS. &ldquo;YOU WOULD KNOW SOMEONE WAS COOL BECAUSE THEY WERE WEARING RICK OWENS. OTHER THAN MARC JACOBS, HE&rsquo;S THE ONLY BRAND I&rsquo;M GOING TO WEAR ONSTAGE.&rdquo;&nbsp; IN AN INDUSTRY DRIVEN BY THE IMPULSE TO ALLAY BOREDOM AT ALL COSTS&mdash;THROUGH RECOURSE TO SUDDEN COLOR SHIFTS AND EXTREME CHANGES IN SILHOUETTES AND HEMLINES&mdash;OWENS, WHO STUDIED FINE ART IN LOS ANGELES BUT NEVER ATTENDED DESIGN SCHOOL, HAS STEADFASTLY PURSUED AN ANTIFASHION ETHIC. HIS BASIC LOOK&mdash;&ldquo;DRIPPY&rdquo; FORMS IN SUBDUED COLORS THAT RANGE FROM &ldquo;DUST&rdquo; TO &ldquo;DARK SHADOW&rdquo;&mdash;CHANGES LITTLE FROM SEASON TO SEASON. HE HAS USED THE WORD &ldquo;MONOTONY&rdquo; TO DESCRIBE HIS WORK AND HAS COMPARED IT TO LOU REED&rsquo;S MUSIC: &ldquo;MINIMAL CHORD CHANGES, AND DIRECT.&rdquo; HE GIVES FEW INTERVIEWS, DOES NOT EMPLOY A PUBLICIST, AND HAS NEVER ADVERTISED HIS LINE; YET HIS DIFFIDENCE SEEMS ONLY TO ENHANCE HIS CACHET AMONG FASHION EDITORS AND INSIDERS. VOGUE SPONSORED HIS FIRST RUNWAY SHOW, IN 2002, AND THAT SAME YEAR HE WON THE C.F.D.A. PERRY ELLIS AWARD FOR EMERGING TALENT. SINCE MOVING TO PARIS, IN 2003, OWENS HAS BEEN EMBRACED BY LOCAL ARBITERS OF STYLE WITH A PASSION RARELY ACCORDED A NON-HOMEGROWN DESIGNER, ESPECIALLY AN AMERICAN. AS THE TIMES RECENTLY REPORTED, &ldquo;FRENCH CRITICS LAUD MR. OWENS&rsquo;S CHALLENGING DESIGNS. FRENCH EDITORS PHOTOGRAPH THEM ALL CONSTANTLY. FRENCH WOMEN BUY THEM WITH RELIGIOUS FERVOR.&rdquo; LAST FALL, OWENS WON A NATIONAL DESIGN AWARD FROM THE COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM. HE APPEARED AT THE CEREMONY, WHICH WAS HELD AT THE MUSEUM, ON FIFTH AVENUE, IN A BLACK LEATHER MOTORCYCLE JACKET, AND HIS SPEECH CONSISTED OF A FEW BARELY AUDIBLE SENTENCES, IN WHICH HE SAID LITTLE MORE THAN &ldquo;THANKS.&rdquo; AS OWENS CONDUCTED HIS FITTING WITH VALENTINE, LAMY APPEARED IN HIS OFFICE CARRYING A COPY OF AN ITALIAN FASHION MAGAZINE, WHICH CONTAINED A FEATURE ON OWENS&rsquo;S CLOTHES, TITLED &ldquo;ELEGANCE BARBARE.&rdquo; LAMY, WHO IS SIXTY-THREE AND ONCE PRACTICED LAW IN PARIS, HELPS DESIGN OWENS&rsquo;S LINE OF FURS, PALAIS ROYAL. (HIS BUSINESS NOW INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO THE FUR AND FURNITURE LINES AND THE RICK OWENS LABEL, FOR MEN AND WOMEN, A LINE OF MIDPRICED WOMEN&rsquo;S WEAR, LILIES.) LAMY IS ALSO THE INSPIRATION FOR MANY OF HIS DESIGNS. A PETITE, DARK-SKINNED WOMAN WITH AN AGELESS, ELFIN FACE, SHE WAS DRESSED IN A BLACK FUR VEST, THICK BLACK TIGHTS, AND A PAIR OF OWENS&rsquo;S &ldquo;MEGATURBO&rdquo; ANKLE BOOTS&mdash;A HIGH PLATFORM WEDGE WITH A CLOVEN TOE AND A LEATHER PROTRUSION AT THE BACK OF THE HEEL. HER STYLISHLY DISHEVELLED HAIR WAS HENNAED, HER FINGERS WERE TATTOOED IN BLUE INK, AND HER ARMS WERE RINGED FROM WRIST TO ELBOW IN GOLD, BONE, AND IVORY BRACELETS. SHE APPROACHED OWENS WITH TOTTERING STEPS, TRAILING A WAKE OF MUSKY PERFUME AND CIGARETTE SMOKE. SHE SMILED, REVEALING TWO GOLD-PLATED FRONT TEETH, AND HELD OUT THE PHOTO SPREAD. &ldquo; &rsquo;AVE YOU SEEN ZIS, REEK?&rdquo; SHE ASKED, IN A FRENCH ACCENT THAT IS NEARLY IMPENETRABLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE SPENT TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS LIVING IN LOS ANGELES, MANY OF THEM AS THE OWNER AND HOSTESS OF LES DEUX CAFES, A POPULAR HOLLYWOOD NIGHT SPOT, IN THE LATE NINETIES. (LAMY ALSO PERFORMED FOR HER CUSTOMERS, CROONING LANGSTON HUGHES POEMS IN A RASPY VOICE TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF A JAZZ ENSEMBLE.) OWENS, WHO WAS SEWING A COMPLICATED FOLD OF DRAPERY ON THE FRONT OF A DRESS, PEERED BRIEFLY AT THE MAGAZINE, AND SAID, &ldquo;HUH. I&rsquo;LL HAVE TO GIVE THAT TO MY MOM.&rdquo; THEN HE WENT BACK TO HIS WORK.&nbsp; AFTER LAMY LEFT THE ROOM, OWENS SAID THAT HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE HE COULD MAKE OUT A WORD SHE SAID. THEY MET IN LOS ANGELES AND HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS, BUT HAVE BEEN MARRIED ONLY SINCE 2006. LAMY, OWENS SAID, IS A &ldquo;MESMERIZING SPHINX.&rdquo; HE WENT ON, &ldquo;I&rsquo;M SO FASCINATED BY SOMEONE WHO ACTS COMPLETELY ON INSTINCT AND FEELINGS, WHERE I&rsquo;M SO PRAGMATIC AND SENSIBLE AND KIND OF&mdash;COMPARED TO HER&mdash;BORING AND CONSERVATIVE.&rdquo; HE STOOD UP AND WATCHED VALENTINE STRUT DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM, A SWATH OF GRAY-AND-WHITE STRIPED SILK FLOATING BEHIND HER. &ldquo;IN CATHOLIC SCHOOL, I ALWAYS LOVED THAT AESTHETIC OF ALL THOSE ROBES DRAGGING IN THOSE DUSTY TEMPLES, WITH JESUS AND THE DISCIPLES AND ALL THAT,&rdquo; HE SAID. &ldquo;IT WAS VERY EXOTIC AND VERY ALLURING TO ME IN MY VERY SAFE LITTLE WORLD OF SMALL-TOWN CALIFORNIA. WHEN I LOOK AROUND HERE IN THE STUDIO, I SEE WANTING TO RE-CREATE THOSE DUSTY TEMPLES AND ROBES AND STUFF.&rdquo;&nbsp; OWENS&rsquo;S PARENTS ALWAYS COME TO PARIS TO ATTEND HIS SHOWS, AND THEY APPEARED AT HIS STUDIO THAT AFTERNOON, AFTER HAVING SPENT THE MORNING SIGHTSEEING AND SHOPPING. AN ONLY CHILD, OWENS WAS BROUGHT UP IN PORTERVILLE, AN AGRICULTURAL TOWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES, WHERE HIS PARENTS STILL LIVE. HIS FATHER, JOHN, RETIRED AS A SOCIAL WORKER WITH THE LOCAL WELFARE DEPARTMENT; HIS MOTHER, CONNIE&mdash;FOR CONCEPCION&mdash;IS FROM PUEBLA, MEXICO, AND WORKED AS A SCHOOLTEACHER. THEY MET IN MEXICO, IN 1958, WHEN JOHN WAS TEACHING ENGLISH IN PUEBLA, AFTER A STINT IN COLLEGE ON THE G.I. BILL. &ldquo;MY PARENTS ARE VERY, VERY CONSERVATIVE,&rdquo; OWENS TOLD ME. &ldquo;BUT THEY&rsquo;RE MEGA-TURBO SWEET.&rdquo; CONNIE, A STRIKING WOMAN OF SEVENTY-FIVE, WHO HAS OWENS&rsquo;S LARGE, EXPRESSIVE EYES, SAT WATCHING HER SON WORK FOR SEVERAL HOURS, OFTEN SIGHING APPRECIATIVELY OVER HIS DESIGNS. SHE ALSO TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS, WHICH SHE WOULD LATER ASSEMBLE INTO A CAREFULLY INDEXED ALBUM. AT HER HOME IN PORTERVILLE, SHE MAINTAINS AN ARCHIVE OF MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MAGAZINES THAT MENTION OWENS. CONNIE IS A GIFTED SEAMSTRESS, WHO, AS A YOUNG WOMAN, OFTEN REPRODUCED, WITHOUT THE AID OF PATTERNS, DRESSES THAT SHE SAW IN SHOP WINDOWS. SHE TOLD ME THAT AT EIGHTEEN OWENS, WHO HAD JUST LEARNED TO SEW, PRODUCED A DRESS WITH CUTOUTS&mdash;A CREATION SO COMPLICATED THAT SHE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE HAD DONE IT. BUT SHE DISAVOWED ANY DIRECT INFLUENCE ON HIS FASHION LINE. SHE RETRIEVED A PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM FROM HER PURSE. &ldquo;I DRESSED HIM UNTIL HE WAS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN,&rdquo; SHE SAID, POINTING TO PICTURES OF OWENS AS A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD IN KNEE SOCKS AND SHORTS, AND AS A TEEN-AGER IN A BROWN SUIT AND TIE. &ldquo;I ALWAYS DRESSED HIM LIKE A LITTLE GENTLEMAN.&rdquo; CONNIE ADDED THAT OWENS&rsquo;S MEMORIES OF THIS PERIOD ARE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY. &ldquo;HE ALWAYS SAID THAT PORTERVILLE WAS A PRISON.&rdquo; JOHN OWENS, A YOUTHFUL EIGHTY-SIX-YEAR-OLD WITH A WHITE BRUSH MUSTACHE AND SMALL BLUE EYES, SPENT THE AFTERNOON AT A LAPTOP COMPUTER IN A CORNER OF THE STUDIO, ENGAGING IN VIGOROUS DEBATE ON THE INTERNET ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, ABORTION, AND GAY MARRIAGE&mdash;ALL OF WHICH HE OPPOSES. JOHN, WHO HAD HOPED THAT HIS SON MIGHT BECOME AN ARCHITECT, SAID THAT HE HAD HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT OWENS&rsquo;S CAREER AS &ldquo;A MALE DESIGNER OF WOMEN&rsquo;S CLOTHING.&rdquo; THE TWO HAD MANY CONFLICTS WHEN OWENS WAS GROWING UP BUT HAVE DRAWN CLOSER AS OWENS HAS BECOME SUCCESSFUL. &ldquo;HE&rsquo;S THE MOST ADORABLE NAZI,&rdquo; OWENS TOLD ME. &ldquo;WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT? I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO PATRONIZE HIM BY SAYING IT&rsquo;S AMUSING, BUT I CAN&rsquo;T HELP BUT LAUGH AT, LIKE, THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HIM AND ME.&rdquo; STILL, TENSIONS PERSIST. TWO DAYS LATER, ON THE DAY OF OWENS&rsquo;S SHOW, MORE THAN A DOZEN RUNWAY MODELS ARRIVED AT THE STUDIO FOR A FINAL FITTING. JOHN SHOOK HIS HEAD. &ldquo;THESE AREN&rsquo;T MY TYPE OF WOMEN AT ALL,&rdquo; HE SAID. &ldquo;I LIKE THEM A LOT CURVIER&mdash;SHAPELY.&rdquo; OWENS, OVERHEARING, ASKED HIM TO REPEAT WHAT HE&rsquo;D SAID. &ldquo;I SAID, &lsquo;SOME OF THESE MODELS NEED TO EAT SOMETHING,&rsquo; &rdquo; JOHN TOLD HIM. AFTER A PAUSE, OWENS SAID, &ldquo;OH,&rdquo; AND TURNED AWAY. JOHN WENT ON, IN A VOICE LOUD ENOUGH FOR OWENS TO HEAR, SAYING THAT HE RESPECTED HIS SON&rsquo;S &ldquo;DISCIPLINE AND DETERMINATION,&rdquo; BUT THAT HIS CLOTHES ARE &ldquo;TOO AVANT-GARDE FOR ME.&rdquo; HE ADDED, &ldquo;RICK IS THE REBEL. HE&rsquo;S A BORN NONCONFORMIST. I FEEL HE&rsquo;S REBELLING AGAINST SOME OF THE WRONG THINGS. WHAT HE REBELS AGAINST IS THE ESTABLISHMENT.&rdquo; OWENS&rsquo;S UPBRINGING WAS BY NO MEANS CONVENTIONAL, DESPITE HIS PARENTS&rsquo; CONSERVATISM. HIS FATHER&rsquo;S INTERESTS RANGED FROM BUDDHISM TO ASTROLOGY, AND HE DID NOT ALLOW A TELEVISION IN THE HOUSE UNTIL OWENS WAS SIXTEEN. HE REQUIRED HIS SON TO READ CANONICAL WORKS OF LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY&mdash;MARCUS AURELIUS, ARISTOTLE, CONFUCIUS&mdash;AND TO LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC. &ldquo;I DEVELOPED THIS METHOD OF CHILD-REARING AFTER READING THOMAS WOLFE&rsquo;S STATEMENT &lsquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T GO HOME AGAIN,&rsquo; &rdquo; JOHN TOLD ME. &ldquo;I ALWAYS INTERPRETED THAT TO MEAN IT&rsquo;S BECAUSE YOU OUTGROW THINGS. WELL, I ALWAYS WANTED TO EXPOSE RICK TO THINGS HE COULDN&rsquo;T GROW OUT OF.&rdquo; AS A BOY, OWENS OFTEN RESENTED THIS REGIMEN OF ENFORCED CULTURAL APPRECIATION, BUT HE HAS SINCE COME TO VALUE IT. &ldquo;I HAVE SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR BECAUSE OF THAT,&rdquo; HE TOLD ME. &ldquo;NO TV, AND ALL THOSE BOOKS AND RECORDS. IT&rsquo;S LIKE WE WERE ON A DESERT ISLAND IN PORTERVILLE, AND ALL WE HAD WAS DEBUSSY, WAGNER, PROUST, HUYSMANS, PIERRE LOTI. AND THEY WERE STORED IN THE BASEMENT, LIKE A BUNKER. THERE&rsquo;S SOMETHING VERY INSULATED ABOUT THAT LIFE THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME. BECAUSE MY LIFE IS STILL LIKE THAT: I DON&rsquo;T GO OUTSIDE OF MY PERSONAL INTERESTS, MY PERSONAL NUCLEUS OF PEOPLE, MUCH.&rdquo; OWENS ATTRIBUTES ELEMENTS OF HIS FASHION AESTHETIC TO THE ART AND LITERATURE THAT HIS FATHER EXPOSED HIM TO&mdash;AND HE HAS TRIED TO CONVINCE JOHN OF THIS. &ldquo;I TOLD HIM, &lsquo;THE REASON I&rsquo;M SO INTO THIS IS BECAUSE I REMEMBER YOU SHOWING ME JAPANESE HAIKU AND JAPANESE IMAGES, BOOKS OF JAPANESE PICTURES; THAT&rsquo;S WHY I HAVE THIS AUSTERITY THAT APPEALS TO ME,&rsquo; &rdquo; OWENS RECALLED. &ldquo;I ALWAYS LOVED HOW THE JAPANESE APPRECIATED THINGS THAT WERE DAMAGED; THEY WOULD ELEVATE THE IDEA OF SOMETHING DAMAGED AND MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL, AND I SAID, &lsquo;THAT IS SO ALL ABOUT WHAT I AM. AND THAT&rsquo;S BECAUSE OF YOU.&rsquo; &quot; OWENS ATTENDED CATHOLIC SCHOOL FROM FIRST GRADE THROUGH SEVENTH GRADE. &ldquo;IT OFFERED ME AN ELEMENT OF EXOTICISM IN MY LIFE,&rdquo; HE SAID. &ldquo;I PRAYED EARNESTLY. I DON&rsquo;T THINK I EVER REALLY REJECTED IT VIOLENTLY. AFTER A WHILE, I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT, OH, THAT WASN&rsquo;T REALLY FOR ME, WAS IT?&rdquo; HE LIKED HIGH SCHOOL MUCH LESS AND SKIPPED MANY CLASSES TO SMOKE POT AND LISTEN TO LED ZEPPELIN WITH FRIENDS. HE GRADUATED IN 1979 AND MOVED TO LOS ANGELES, WHERE HE STUDIED FINE ARTS AT THE OTIS-PARSONS ART INSTITUTE. HE WAS CAPTIVATED BY THE WORK OF THE CONCEPTUAL ARTIST JOSEPH BEUYS. &ldquo;HE WAS MY FIRST BIG IDOL, BECAUSE IT WAS ALL ABOUT INSULATION AND PROTECTION, AND IT WAS VERY MILITARY, KIND OF,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. BUT HE SOON REALIZED THAT HE LACKED THE DISCIPLINE THAT HE BELIEVED WAS NECESSARY TO BECOME AN ARTIST. &ldquo;I GOT INTIMIDATED BY IT,&rdquo; HE SAID. &ldquo;IT WAS TOO INTENSE&mdash;LIKE ENTERING THE PRIESTHOOD.&rdquo;&nbsp; HE LEFT OTIS-PARSONS AFTER TWO YEARS, TO STUDY PATTERN-CUTTING AT A TRADE COLLEGE. HE BEGAN CREATING COSTUMES AND SETS FOR LOCAL ARTISTS AND PERFORMERS, MEMBERS OF WHAT HE HAS CALLED &ldquo;THE WICKED HOLLYWOOD HUSTLER-BAR WORLD.&rdquo; FOR FOUR YEARS, HE WORKED IN KNOCKOFF HOUSES IN LOS ANGELES, COPYING IN CHEAP FABRICS THE WORK OF WELL KNOWN FASHION DESIGNERS. THE EXPERIENCE PROVED INVALUABLE. MANY DESIGNERS NEVER MASTER THE DIFFICULT ART OF PATTERN-CUTTING, AND THE ORIGINALITY AND SOPHISTICATION OF OWENS&rsquo;S CLOTHES&mdash;HIS ABILITY TO PLANT SEAMS IN UNEXPECTED PLACES AND TO HANG FABRICS ON THE BIAS SO THAT THE CROSS GRAIN CLINGS TO OR DRAPES DRAMATICALLY FROM THE BODY&mdash;DERIVE FROM HIS YEARS IN THE KNOCKOFF MILLS. &ldquo;PICASSO DID CLASSIC FIGURE DRAWING IN THE BEGINNING, AND THEN, AFTER THAT, HE ABSTRACTED,&rdquo; OWENS TOLD ME. &ldquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T CONVINCINGLY GET ABSTRACT UNTIL YOU REALLY KNOW THE FUNDAMENTALS. IT&rsquo;S THE SAME THING WITH PATTERN-MAKING. YOU CAN&rsquo;T START DISTORTING THINGS UNLESS YOU KIND OF KNOW WHAT YOU&rsquo;RE DOING.&rdquo; IN 1988, OWENS&rsquo;S BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME HELPED HIM OBTAIN A JOB AS A PATTERN CUTTER AT A LOS ANGELES SPORTSWEAR COMPANY OWNED BY LAMY, WHO ALSO OWNED A FRENCH BISTRO, CAFE DES ARTISTES. SHE HAD MARRIED AN EXPERIMENTAL FILMMAKER, RICHARD NEWTON, AND HAD A DAUGHTER, SCARLETT. OWENS WORKED FOR TWO YEARS AT LAMY&rsquo;S COMPANY BEFORE THEY BEGAN AN AFFAIR. OWENS LEFT HIS BOYFRIEND, LAMY LEFT HER HUSBAND, AND THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER. STRAPPED FOR CASH, THEY STAYED IN CHEAP HOTELS, INCLUDING ONE THAT OWENS&rsquo;S FRIEND THE INTERSEX MULTIMEDIA ARTIST VAGINAL DAVIS CALLS A &ldquo;FIRST-F CK HOTEL,&rdquo; OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. OWENS AND LAMY DRANK AND USED DRUGS PROLIFICALLY, INSPIRED IN PART BY THE ROCK MUSICIANS THEY ADMIRED&mdash;IGGY POP, KEITH RICHARDS, AND DAVID BOWIE. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S ALSO BAUDELAIRE AND TENNESSEE WILLIAMS,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S JUST THE WHOLE IDEA OF EXCESS AND THE PHRASE &lsquo;A CANDLE THAT BURNS AT BOTH ENDS MIGHT BURN SHORTER, BUT IT BURNS BRIGHTER.&rsquo; &rdquo; LAMY, OWENS SAYS, WAS &ldquo;AN ENTHUSIASTIC DRINKER,&rdquo; BUT, HE ADDS, &ldquo;SHE NEVER WENT AS DEEP AS I DID AND WAS THE ONE TO CALL THE PRIVATE NURSES WHEN I GOT TOO BAD.&rdquo;&nbsp; OWENS AND LAMY HAVE BEEN SOBER FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, BUT HIS MEMORIES OF THAT TIME CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE HIS WORK. &ldquo;I WANT IT TO LOOK USED AND DAMAGED, AND I THINK THAT&rsquo;S WHY WOMEN OVER FORTY RELATE,&rdquo; HE SAID. &ldquo;WE ALL DABBLED IN DRUGS. WE HAD MOMENTS OF BEAUTY BUT ALSO TIMES OF PROBLEMS. IT&rsquo;S NOT A SPARKLING DISCO MINIDRESS THAT&rsquo;S SHINY AND SILVER AND PERFECT AND HOLDING EVERYTHING IN PLACE. LIFE IS NOT LIKE THAT.&rdquo; LAST FALL, OWENS PUBLISHED A BOOK OF PHOTOGRAPHS, &ldquo;L&rsquo;AI-JE BIEN DESCENDU?&rdquo; (&ldquo;HOW WAS MY DESCENT?&rdquo;), WHICH INCLUDES A SELF-PORTRAIT THAT SHOWS HIM SLUMPED, SHIRTLESS, AT A TABLE IN FRONT OF A BOTTLE OF VODKA AND A HANDGUN. ANOTHER IMAGE SHOWS HIM WITH THE GUN&rsquo;S BARREL IN HIS MOUTH AND BLOOD&mdash;WHICH OWENS LATER PAINTED IN&mdash;EXPLODING FROM THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. HE REGARDS THE SUICIDE PHOTOGRAPH AS AN HOMAGE TO HIS DAYS AS A DRUG USER AND HAD IT PRINTED ON A SILK SCARF, WHICH SELLS FOR ABOUT NINETY DOLLARS AT HIS BOUTIQUE IN THE PALAIS ROYAL, NEAR THE LOUVRE.&nbsp; EVEN DURING HIS MOST DISSOLUTE PERIOD, OWENS NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAVE THE KNOCKOFF BUSINESS AND CREATE HIS OWN LINE. &ldquo;I JUST ASSUMED THAT I&rsquo;D DO THIS FOR A WHILE, THEN I&rsquo;D DO MY OWN THING,&rdquo; HE SAID. IN 1994, WHEN HE WAS SOBER, HE BOUGHT INEXPENSIVE FABRIC REMNANTS&mdash;SILK GEORGETTE, COTTON RIBS, COTTON JERSEY&mdash;AT A DOWNTOWN JOBBER AND, AFTER WASHING AND DYING THEM, SCULPTED THEM INTO UNEXPECTEDLY SOPHISTICATED T-SHIRTS, SKIRTS, AND DRESSES. PERHAPS THE MOST UPSCALE STORES IN LOS ANGELES WAS MAXFIELD, ON MELROSE AVENUE, WHICH SPECIALIZED IN CLOTHES BY EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNERS LIKE YOHJI YAMAMOTO AND COMME DES GAR&Ccedil;ONS. OWENS BROUGHT HIS CLOTHES TO MAXFIELD, BUT THE STORE&rsquo;S BUYER WASN&rsquo;T AVAILABLE TO LOOK AT THEM. &ldquo;SO I WENT TO THE NEXT BEST STORE, CHARLES GALLAY&rdquo;&mdash;THE FIRST RETAILER IN LOS ANGELES TO CARRY VERSACE, MONTANA, MUGLER, AND MARTIN MARGIELA (DESIGNERS KNOWN FOR WHAT OWENS CALLS &ldquo;THE REALLY EXTREME STUFF &quot;). GALLAY ARRANGED AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL WITH OWENS. &ldquo;I SAID, &lsquo;I&rsquo;M BROKE. CAN YOU PAY FIFTY PER CENT UP FRONT?&rsquo; AND THEY DID,&rdquo; OWENS RECALLED. &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S HOW I DID IT. I NEVER GOT AN INSURANCE POLICY, I NEVER HAD EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, I DIDN&rsquo;T DO TAXES, I DIDN&rsquo;T TAKE OUT A LOAN. I HAD ONE SEWER FULL TIME AND THEN TWO SEWERS WHEN IT WAS MORE OF A CRUNCH. I WAS BARELY, BARELY SURVIVING AND WE WEREN&rsquo;T MAKING THAT MANY CLOTHES, BUT I HAD NO OVERHEAD, SO I WAS ABLE TO DO IT.&rdquo; A FEW YEARS LATER, WHEN THE CHARLES GALLAY STORE CLOSED, OWENS NEGOTIATED AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL WITH TOMMY PERSE, THE OWNER OF MAXFIELD. LISA LOVE, A WEST COAST EDITOR OF VOGUE, SAYS THAT OWENS&rsquo;S MOVE FROM GALLAY TO MAXFIELD COINCIDED WITH A CHANGE IN HIS WORK. &ldquo;AT MAXFIELD, HE MOVED INTO THE MORE HIGH-END FABRICS AND THE MORE TORTURED DESIGNS, DRAPING LEATHERS AND CASHMERES AND FUR, AND MAKING THESE INCREDIBLE T-SHIRTS,&rdquo; LOVE SAID. &ldquo;THE CASHMERES WERE SO LUXURIOUS, BUT THEN HE WOULD THROW THEM IN A POT OF DYE. I MEAN, NO ONE TREATS FABRIC LIKE THAT. MACHINE-WASHING THE LEATHER! LOS ANGELES WAS AND IS, MOSTLY, A VERY JEANS KIND OF WORLD. BUT HIS STUFF WAS DIFFERENT FROM STUFF THAT WAS COMING OUT OF LOS ANGELES. AND NEW YORK, TOO, FOR THAT MATTER. VERY BODY-HUGGING, CLINGY, NOT CONVENTIONAL. IT WAS MORTICIA-LIKE&mdash; WITCHY AT THE SAME TIME AS ELEGANT AND GOTH. STREET, BUT IT LOOKED SO GREAT ON SO MANY WOMEN.&rdquo; BY THIS TIME, OWENS AND LAMY WERE LIVING IN A FORMER FIVE-AND-DIME STOREFRONT ON LAS PALMAS, A GRITTY SIDE STREET OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. THEY STRIPPED THE INTERIOR WALLS AND CEILINGS TO THE PLASTER AND FURNISHED THEIR ROOMS WITH A THRIFT-STORE VERSION OF OWENS&rsquo;S BEUYS-INSPIRED BEDS AND COUCHES, USING FLANNEL ARMY BLANKETS AND CASHMERE TO DRAPE THE WALLS AND WINDOWS. THE SIDEWALKS IN FRONT OF THEIR BUILDING WERE A GATHERING PLACE FOR RUNAWAYS, TRANSSEXUAL HOOKERS, AND DRUG ADDICTS, WHO PROVIDED OWENS WITH A CONSTANT SOURCE OF INSPIRATION. IN THE EARLY NINETIES, LAMY&rsquo;S SPORTSWEAR COMPANY DECLARED BANKRUPTCY, AND SHE DEVOTED HER ATTENTION TO CAFE DES ARTISTES, WHICH BECAME SO SUCCESSFUL THAT, IN 1997, SHE OPENED A LARGER RESTAURANT, ACROSS THE STREET FROM THEIR HOME ON LAS PALMAS. SHE BOUGHT A CRUMBLING FORMER CRACK HOUSE AND THE ADJOINING PARKING LOT AND TURNED THEM INTO A VINE-DRAPED BISTRO THAT SHE CALLED LES DEUX CAFES. THE RESTAURANT WAS POPULAR WITH DIRECTORS AND ACTORS, INCLUDING OLIVER STONE, QUENTIN TARANTINO, PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON, AND NICOLE KIDMAN. &ldquo;IT WASN&rsquo;T THIS WEIRD, NEW, CELEBRITY-FOR-CELEBRITY&rsquo;S-SAKE NONSENSE THAT YOU HAVE NOW,&rdquo; COURTNEY LOVE, WHO WAS ALSO A REGULAR, TOLD ME. &ldquo;THE VIBE WAS JUST COOLER.&rdquo; LAMY, DRESSED IN CLOTHES BY OWENS, OFTEN PERFORMED THE DUTIES OF HOSTESS. &ldquo;SHE LOOKED COOL,&rdquo; LOVE RECALLED. &ldquo;I ASKED HER, &lsquo;WHO MADE THAT SKIRT?&rsquo; &rdquo; SOON, LOVE AND OTHER CELEBRITIES WERE VISITING OWENS&rsquo;S STUDIO, ACROSS THE STREET. HIS SLEAZILY GLAMOROUS LEATHER JACKET, WHICH HAD RIBBING ALONG THE INNER SEAMS OF THE ARMS TO MAKE THEM HUG THE BODY, WAS PARTICULARLY PRIZED BY LAMY&rsquo;S CUSTOMERS. IT MANAGED TO SEEM BOTH LUXURIOUS AND CASUAL, AN EFFECT THAT OWENS ACHIEVED BY MACHINE-WASHING AND TUMBLE-DRYING THE LEATHER UNTIL IT RESEMBLED DESICCATED SKIN. &ldquo;IT WAS REAL POPULAR WITH ROCKERS OR PEOPLE WILLING TO TAKE THAT KIND OF CHANCE,&rdquo; LOVE SAID. &ldquo;ANDROGYNOUS WOMEN AND POWER LESBIANS.&rdquo; OWENS&rsquo;S JACKET AND HIS TATTERED T-SHIRTS BEGAN TO APPEAR IN PHOTO SPREADS IN ART AND FASHION MAGAZINES. IN 1998, JULIE GILHART, THE FASHION DIRECTOR AT BARNEYS, SAW A PHOTOGRAPH OF AN OWENS T-SHIRT IN AN OBSCURE FASHION MAGAZINE WHOSE NAME SHE NO LONGER RECALLS. GILHART HAD NO IDEA HOW TO CONTACT OWENS, BUT SHE TORE OUT THE PAGE AND KEPT IT ON HER DESK. A YEAR LATER, BARNEYS&rsquo; CREATIVE DIRECTOR, SIMON DOONAN, WHO HAD BEEN A WINDOW DRESSER AT MAXFIELD, TOLD GILHART THAT OWENS LIVED IN LOS ANGELES. GILHART BEGAN TO BUY HIS LINE FOR BARNEYS, WHERE IT BECAME A TOP SELLER. I WAS IN BARNEYS LAST SPRING WHEN A SHIPMENT ARRIVED ON THE FIFTH FLOOR. THE REST OF THE STORE WAS NEARLY EMPTY, BUT WOMEN CROWDED FOUR DEEP TO GET AT OWENS&rsquo;S CLOTHES AND BOUGHT FOUR OR FIVE PIECES EACH. (PRICES RANGE FROM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A RIBBED TANK TOP TO SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR A WATERSNAKE JACKET.) I MENTIONED WHAT I&rsquo;D SEEN TO GILHART, WHO SAID THAT IT WAS HARDLY UNUSUAL. &ldquo;I LOVE RICK BECAUSE HE&rsquo;S SO PERFECTLY BARNEYS,&rdquo; SHE TOLD ME. &ldquo;HE DOESN&rsquo;T ADVERTISE, HE ISN&rsquo;T ALL OVER THE MAGAZINES, YET HE APPEALS TO A LUXURY CUSTOMER. EVEN THOUGH HE&rsquo;S NOT SEEN AS A LUXURY BRAND, HE IS. HE&rsquo;S THE ESSENCE OF INSIDER EXCLUSIVITY.&rdquo; IN 2003, HENRI BENDEL, THE FIFTH AVENUE DEPARTMENT STORE, CREATED A RICK OWENS SALON ON ITS TOP FLOOR. &ldquo;ANYONE WHO LOVED RICK WOULD BE UP THERE LOOKING THROUGH THE RACKS,&rdquo; SALLY SINGER, THE FASHION-NEWS DIRECTOR AT VOGUE, TOLD ME. &ldquo;YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD GO ON SALE, AND IT WOULDN&rsquo;T, BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT AT FULL PRICE.&rdquo; SINGER WAS AMONG THE FIRST MEMBERS OF THE FASHION ESTABLISHMENT TO PROMOTE OWENS&rsquo;S WORK. SHE LIVES IN THE CHELSEA HOTEL&mdash;WHERE SHE RECENTLY HELD A CANDLELIT DINNER FOR OWENS AND FIFTY FRIENDS AND ADMIRERS&mdash; BUT AS A TEEN-AGER SHE SPENT TIME IN LOS ANGELES. &ldquo;I KNOW THE CLUBS AND THE MUSIC THAT HE CARED ABOUT, AND THE KIND OF GOTH, SPEED METAL, SLIGHTLY DISTRESSED, AND WORN EDGE THAT HE BRINGS TO LUXURIOUS THINGS,&rdquo; SHE TOLD ME. &ldquo;BUT I THINK I ALSO REALLY RESPOND TO THE CLASSICAL IMAGERY IN HIS CLOTHES. THIS IS A DEEPLY CULTURED PERSON PUTTING OUT THESE THINGS. HE KNOWS THE HISTORY OF ARMOR, HE KNOWS THE HISTORY OF DRAPING, AND THE GRECIAN STUFF.&rdquo;&nbsp; BY 2001, OWENS&rsquo;S BUSINESS HAD GROWN TOO LARGE FOR HIM TO CONTINUE PRODUCING CLOTHES IN HIS HOME STUDIO. SO HE SIGNED A DEAL WITH EBA, AN ITALIAN SALES AGENCY, NOW A DIVISION OF NAXECO, THAT HAD REPRESENTED OTHER AVANT-GARDE DESIGNERS, MAINLY EUROPEANS, INCLUDING OLIVIER THEYSKENS AND ANN DEMEULEMEESTER. EBA&rsquo;S PRESIDENT, LUCA RUGGERI, AND ITS C.E.O., RUGGERI&rsquo;S SISTER-IN- LAW, ELSA LANZO, WERE INTRODUCED TO OWENS&rsquo;S WORK BY A FRENCH BUYER. &ldquo;HE WAS DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT&mdash;WHAT WE WOULD WEAR,&rdquo; RUGGERI, A TALL MAN WHO OFTEN DRESSES IN OWENS&rsquo;S MENSWEAR LINE OF DISTRESSED-LEATHER JACKETS AND SHARP-SHOULDERED BLAZERS, TOLD ME. EBA HELPED OWENS FIND A MANUFACTURER FOR HIS CLOTHES AND SOLD THEM TO STORES, AND IN 2003 OWENS BECAME THE AGENCY&rsquo;S PRINCIPAL CLIENT. &ldquo;THEY DIDN&rsquo;T KNOW ME VERY WELL AT THE BEGINNING, AND IT WASN&rsquo;T A VERY BIG COLLECTION&mdash;MAYBE TWELVE PIECES&mdash;SO NOBODY ASKED THAT MANY QUESTIONS, BECAUSE IT WASN&rsquo;T A BIG INVESTMENT,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. &ldquo;IT WENT WELL, SO, AS WE GREW, NOBODY QUESTIONED WHAT I WANTED TO DO, OR HOW MUCH MONEY I WAS GOING TO SPEND.&rdquo; EVEN NOW, OWENS TOLD ME, RUGGERI AND LANZO DON&rsquo;T SEE THE CLOTHES UNTIL THE WEEK BEFORE THEY START SELLING THEM. &ldquo;WE DON&rsquo;T TALK ABOUT IT, I DON&rsquo;T SHOW THEM ANYTHING,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. &ldquo;THEY&rsquo;RE BOTH INCREDIBLE,&rdquo; HE ADDED. &ldquo;I COULDN&rsquo;T BE LUCKIER.&rdquo; OWENS&rsquo;S ARRANGEMENT WITH EBA WAS CONSIDERED UNUSUAL AT THE TIME. &ldquo;AT THAT MOMENT, ALL THE DRAMA IN FASHION WAS ABOUT HOW TO JOIN A CONGLOMERATE,&rdquo; SINGER TOLD ME. &ldquo;WHO WAS GETTING THE BIG JOBS, WHO WAS TAKING OVER THE BIG HOUSES, WHO WAS GOING TO GET BACKING FROM THE GUCCI GROUP. STELLA MCCARTNEY SIGNED UP, ALEXANDER MCQUEEN SIGNED UP, BALENCIAGA WAS BOUGHT BY GUCCI.&rdquo; IN THE FALL OF 2001, SINGER INCLUDED OWENS IN A STORY THAT SHE WROTE FOR VOGUE ABOUT A SMALL GROUP OF MOSTLY EUROPEAN DESIGNERS WHO HAD REFUSED TO SELL THEIR LABELS TO A CONGLOMERATE, AND SHE ARRANGED TO HAVE OWENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY ANNIE LEIBOVITZ. IN THE IMAGE, HE APPEARS SHIRTLESS, IN UNBUTTONED BLACK JEANS, ON THE EDGE OF A BED IN A LOW-RENT MOTEL ROOM. STANDING NEXT TO HIM IS HIS FRIEND KEMBRA PFAHLER, THE LEAD SINGER OF THE NEW YORK PUNK BAND THE VOLUPTUOUS HORROR OF KAREN BLACK, DRESSED IN A CLASSIC OWENS ENSEMBLE: AN INTRICATELY GATHERED, FLOOR-LENGTH, SANDCOLORED SKIRT AND A LONG-SLEEVED T-SHIRT. IN ORDER TO PERSUADE ANNA WINTOUR, THE EDITOR OF VOGUE, TO FEATURE OWENS PROMINENTLY IN THE MAGAZINE, SINGER AND LOVE ARRANGED FOR HIM TO VISIT WINTOUR AT HER SUITE AT THE RITZ, IN PARIS. &ldquo;HE CAME WITH A LONG ARMY DUFFELBAG FULL OF CLOTHES, AND A MODEL, AND HE JUST PULLED THEM OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND PUT THEM ON THE MODEL IN FRONT OF ANNA,&rdquo; SINGER RECALLED. &ldquo;IT WAS EIGHT OR NINE IN THE MORNING. WE HAD THIS FANTASY THAT WAS AN EARLY HOUR FOR RICK OWENS. I DON&rsquo;T ACTUALLY KNOW IF IT WAS.&rdquo; WINTOUR PUBLISHED THE LEIBOVITZ PHOTOGRAPH AS A DOUBLE-PAGE SPREAD, AND FIVE MONTHS LATER VOGUE SPONSORED OWENS&rsquo;S FIRST FASHION SHOW, IN NEW YORK. WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, OWENS HAD WON A PERRY ELLIS AWARD, AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR HE WAS HIRED AS THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR FOR REVILLON FRERES, THE PARIS FUR COMPANY, FOUNDED IN 1723. THE LABEL, LIKE MANY OTHER UPSCALE FURRIERS, HAD ATTRACTED A FOLLOWING IN THE NINETEEN-SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES BUT HAD SINCE DECLINED IN POPULARITY. OWENS, FOR HIS FIRST COLLECTION, WHICH HE PRESENTED IN THE SUMMER OF 2003, MADE PUFFY SKI JACKETS LINED WITH SABLE, COATS TRIMMED WITH HAND-KNOTTED OSTRICH FEATHERS, AND A JACKET WITH A MINK TORSO, FOX SLEEVES, AND A GOAT-AND-HORSETAIL FRINGE. &ldquo;JUST AS SURELY AS JOHN GALLIANO SMASHED THE RESTRAINED, BOURGEOIS IMAGE AT DIOR, OWENS KNOCKED THE STUFFING AND THE STUFFINESS OUT OF FURS,&rdquo; SUZY MENKES, THE INFLUENTIAL FASHION CRITIC FOR THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, WROTE IN A REVIEW. (IN 2006, REVILLON WAS SOLD AND OWENS LEFT THE COMPANY. LAST YEAR, HE LAUNCHED HIS OWN FUR LINE, PALAIS ROYAL.) WITH EACH NEW FAVORABLE NOTICE, OWENS SEEMS MORE DETERMINED TO PROVE HIS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE FASHION ESTABLISHMENT. IN MAY, 2002, HE PUBLISHED A GRAINY, BLACK-AND-WHITE SELFPORTRAIT IN THE BRITISH MAGAZINE I-D, IN WHICH HE APPEARED ON ALL FOURS, CLAD ONLY IN A PAIR OF BLACK LEATHER CHAPS. FACING HIM, IN A CRUDELY PIECED-TOGETHER DOUBLE EXPOSURE, WAS ANOTHER IMAGE OF HIM, URINATING INTO HIS DOPPELG&Auml;NGER&rsquo;S MOUTH.&nbsp; THE PHOTOGRAPH, AS GUY TREBAY NOTED IN THE TIMES, WAS NOT LIKELY TO APPEAR IN VOGUE &ldquo;DURING ANY OF OUR LIVES.&rdquo; IN 2006, OWENS OPENED HIS BOUTIQUE IN THE PALAIS ROYAL&mdash;THE ENCLOSED ARCADE WHERE LOUIS XIV LIVED AS A BOY&mdash;AND LATER INSTALLED, NEAR THE FRONT WINDOWS, OVERLOOKING THE COLONNADE, A LIFE-SIZE, ANATOMICALLY CORRECT NUDE WAX SCULPTURE OF HIMSELF, MADE BY ARTISANS WHO SUPPLY WORKS TO MADAME TUSSAUDS. THE SCULPTURE, WHICH OWENS SHOWED AT A TRADE FAIR IN FLORENCE, WAS EQUIPPED WITH TUBING ENABLING IT TO RELEASE A JET OF FAKE URINE. OWENS REFRAINED FROM ACTIVATING THE PEE FUNCTION WHEN HE INSTALLED THE WORK IN HIS STORE, AND HE DRAPED THE FIGURE IN A BLACK VELVET CLOAK. EVEN SO, HE SAYS, &ldquo;ANYONE WHO EXPRESSES INTEREST CAN SEE WHAT&rsquo;S UNDER THE CAPE.&rdquo; HE DOESN&rsquo;T WORRY THAT HIS PROVOCATIVENESS WILL ALIENATE CUSTOMERS OR CRITICS. &ldquo;I KNOW I&rsquo;M NOT EVERYBODY&rsquo;S CUP OF TEA,&rdquo; HE TOLD ME, &ldquo;AND I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO BE.&rdquo;&nbsp; ON THE MORNING OF THE DAY OF OWENS&rsquo;S SPRING 2008 SHOW, ABOUT TWENTY MODELS ARRIVED AT HIS STUDIO FOR A FINAL FITTING. A MAKEUP ARTIST AND A HAIR- DRESSER DISCUSSED WITH HIM HOW TO ARRANGE THE MODELS&rsquo; FACES AND HAIR. HIS CHIEF STYLIST, PANOS YIAPANIS, AND HIS ASSISTANT, ASHA MINES, COLLECTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE MODELS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE LOOKS, WHICH THEY TACKED TO A LARGE BOARD. AS THE MOOD IN THE STUDIO GREW MORE FRANTIC, JUSTINIAN KFOURY, A FASHION AGENT AND A FRIEND OF OWENS&rsquo;S FROM LOS ANGE- LES, ANNOUNCED THAT THE &ldquo;KADRINGLE&rdquo; HAD BEGUN&mdash;HIS TERM FOR THE FRENZY, FUELLED BY ADRENALINE AND TERROR, THAT INVARIABLY PRECEDES A RUNWAY SHOW. THE ONLY PERSON WHO SEEMED IMMUNE TO THE KADRINGLE WAS OWENS. HE STROLLED CALMLY THROUGH THE STUDIO, ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN HIS UNHURRIED CALIFORNIA DRAWL. NOT FAR AWAY, AT THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, WORKERS HUNG LIGHTS ABOVE A CENTRAL RUNWAY IN THE MAIN HALL&mdash;A SOARING SPACE THAT HAS A VAULTED CEILING DECORATED WITH REPRODUCTIONS OF ITALIAN MURALS. AROUND FOUR O&rsquo;CLOCK, OWENS&rsquo;S MODELS ASSEMBLED BACKSTAGE, AT THE FOOT OF A WIDE FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEIR LONG HAIR WAS ROLLED AND PINNED UNDER IN HIGH BUNS, AND SMOOTHED AWAY FROM THEIR FOREHEADS TO CREATE AN AERODYNAMIC EFFECT. THEIR FACES WERE MADE TO LOOK PALE WITH FOUNDATION, AND THEIR EYEBROWS CONCEALED WITH MAKEUP. PHOTOGRAPHERS, FASHION REPORTERS, AND FRIENDS OF OWENS&rsquo;S GATHERED ON A LANDING AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS. A REPORTER FROM THE TIMES INTERVIEWED OWENS&rsquo;S FATHER. &ldquo;I&rsquo;M ENJOYING THE REFLECTED GLORY OF BEING RICK OWENS&rsquo;S PARENT!&rdquo; HE EXCLAIMED AFTERWARD. OWENS ARRIVED AT ABOUT FIVE O&rsquo;CLOCK AND LINGERED NEAR THE RUNWAY, WATCHING AS THE TECHNICIANS FINISHED INSTALLING THE LIGHTS. HE WAS DRESSED IN BLACK JEANS, A LONG, DARK, MILITARY-STYLE COAT, AND A PAIR OF BOOTS WITH FIVE-INCH HEELS. GAZING AROUND THE ROOM, HE CONSIDERED HIS CAREER. &ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T KNOW IF ANYONE CAN START THE WAY I DID ANYMORE,&rdquo; HE SAID. &ldquo;THERE ARE SO MANY DESIGNERS NOW&mdash;THEY&rsquo;RE THE NEW ROCK BANDS.&rdquo; THEN HE JOINED YIAPANIS AND MINES BACKSTAGE, WHERE THEY WERE HELPING THE MODELS INTO THE CLOTHES. APART FROM A FEW WHO WERE WEARING OWENS&rsquo;S NARROW BLACK LEATHER JACKETS, MOST OF THE MODELS WERE DRESSED IN TUNICS AND DROOPY SHORTS MADE FROM LAYERS OF SEMI-TRANSPARENT ORGANZA AND GAZAR, A LOOSELY WOVEN SILK FABRIC PRINTED WITH A PATTERN OF GRAY AND WHITE STRIPES THAT OWENS HAD DESIGNED ON A COMPUTER. THE TUNICS WERE WRAPPED AROUND THE MODELS&rsquo; TORSOS LIKE M&Ouml;BIUS STRIPS OR STIFFLY FOLDED ORIGAMI. ALL THE MODELS WORE OWENS&rsquo;S MEGA-TURBO BOOTS, ALONG WITH BLACK SOCKS EMBLAZONED ACROSS THE TOP WITH THE TITLE OF THE COLLECTION: CREATCH, SHORT FOR &ldquo;CREATURE,&rdquo; A NICKNAME THAT OWENS&rsquo;S FRIENDS GAVE HIM AS A TEENAGER. THE FLOWING YET RIGOROUSLY STRUCTURED TUNICS REFLECTED OWENS&rsquo;S LOVE OF EARLY-TWENTIETH-CENTURY DESIGNERS SUCH AS VIONNET, FORTUNY, AND GRES, AND THE LOW-SLUNG SHORTS CONJURED SKATER STREET WEAR. WHEN I ASKED OWENS ABOUT HIS INSPIRATION FOR THE COLLECTION, HE SAID, &ldquo;I JUST THINK, ELEGANT MONSTERS.&rdquo; AT 6:30 P.M., THE SOUNDTRACK BEGAN TO PLAY FROM BEYOND A HIGH WHITE SCRIM SEPARATING THE BACKSTAGE AREA FROM THE RUNWAY. DESPITE HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR IGGY, BOWIE, AMERICAN HEAVY METAL, AND GERMAN OPERA, OWENS SAYS THAT HE DISLIKES THE &ldquo;FRANTIC&rdquo; MUSIC THAT MANY DESIGNERS USE AT SHOWS, AND HE HAD CHOSEN A PIECE BY A LONDON-BASED TECHNO MUSICIAN CALLED REX THE DOG. HE HAD ASKED A FRIEND TO SLOW THE MUSIC TO HALF SPEED&mdash;TO ONE BEAT PER SECOND. &ldquo;I HOPE IT&rsquo;LL FORCE PEOPLE TO SLOW THEIR EYE AND LOOK AT THE CLOTHING,&rdquo; HE TOLD ME. OWENS SAID THAT THE CLANGING, DISTORTED ELECTRONIC NOISE THAT FILLED THE HALL SOUNDED TO HIM &ldquo;KIND OF LIKE A STONED ICE-CREAM TRUCK.&rdquo; AS THE MODELS HURRIED TO FORM A LINE BEFORE STEPPING ONTO THE RUNWAY, OWENS, WHO HAD REMOVED HIS COAT AND WAS WEARING A BLACK WIFE-BEATER T- SHIRT, STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE SCRIM, JUST OUT OF VIEW OF THE AUDIENCE, AND ADJUSTED EACH OUTFIT. THE COLLECTION HAD TAKEN OWENS MONTHS TO CONCEIVE AND MANUFACTURE. THE SHOW LASTED FIFTEEN MINUTES. AFTERWARD, FANS APPEARED BACKSTAGE TO CONGRATULATE HIM. COURTNEY LOVE, WEARING A RICK OWENS BLACK LEATHER JACKET LINED IN WHITE SHEARLING AND HIS MEGA-TURBO BOOTS, EMBRACED HIM. BUT OWENS DIDN&rsquo;T LINGER. ACCOMPANIED BY LAMY AND HIS PARENTS, HE SOON LEFT THE BUILDING TO ATTEND A PARTY HOSTED BY THE VINTAGE-CLOTHING RETAILER DIDIER LUDOT, IN FRONT OF HIS BOUTIQUE IN THE COLONNADE AT THE PALAIS ROYAL. OWENS STAYED AT THE PARTY FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES, THEN LEFT TO HAVE DINNER AT DAVE, A CLAUSTROPHOBIC CHINESE RESTAURANT THAT SERVES MIDDLING FOOD BUT HAS, FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS, ATTRACTED TOP DESIGNERS AND FASHION POWER BROKERS. &ldquo;IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE WALLS, IT&rsquo;S ALL LAGERFELD AND EVERYBODY,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. &ldquo;I WAS A LITTLE INTIMIDATED, AND I NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE IF MICHELE HADN&rsquo;T MADE ME GO. YOU KNOW, MICHELE DOESN&rsquo;T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING.&rdquo; OWENS AND HIS PARTY, WHICH INCLUDED GARETH PUGH, A TWENTY-SIX- YEAR-OLD BRITISH DESIGNER OF PUNK- AND GLAM-INSPIRED CLOTHING, WHOM LAMY HAD STARTED PROMOTING, WERE SEATED AT A COVETED TABLE NEAR THE RESTAURANT&rsquo;S ENTRANCE. AT THE NEXT TABLE, TO OWENS&rsquo;S UNRESTRAINED EXCITEMENT, WAS THE JAPANESE DESIGNER REI KAWAKUBO. A FEW MINUTES AFTER OWENS&rsquo;S GROUP SAT DOWN, COURTNEY LOVE ARRIVED. SHE PULLED UP A CHAIR, SQUEEZED IN BESIDE JOHN OWENS, AND BEGAN TO DESCRIBE AN ABORTIVE PLAN TO BUY KATE MOSS&rsquo;S HOUSE IN LONDON. BUT NO ONE WAS LISTENING. JOHN OWENS&rsquo;S SPOON HAD GONE MISSING, AND HE WAS COMPLAINING VOCIFEROUSLY. OWENS TRIED TO FLAG DOWN A WAITER.&nbsp; &ldquo;DO YOU WANT TO HEAR MY KATE MOSS STORY?&rdquo; LOVE SAID, WITH EXASPERATION. &ldquo;YEAH,&rdquo; OWENS REPLIED, LOOKING UNDER NAPKINS AND SCANNING THE FLOOR. &ldquo;BUT WE&rsquo;VE GOT TO GET DAD&rsquo;S SPOON SETTLED.&rdquo; A NEW SPOON WAS PROCURED FROM DAVE CHUNG, THE RESTAURANT&rsquo;S OWNER, AND LOVE FINISHED HER ANECDOTE. (&ldquo;I COULDN&rsquo;T BUY THE HOUSE WHEN I SAW THAT KATE&rsquo;S WALK-IN CLOSET WAS BIGGER THAN HER KID&rsquo;S BEDROOM!&rdquo;) SOON, SHE AND JOHN OWENS WERE DEEP IN CONVERSATION ABOUT A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER THAT JOHN HAD BEEN READING ABOUT ON THE INTERNET. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S A CONDITION CALLED APOTEMNOPHILIA,&rdquo; HE EXPLAINED. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S A COMPULSION PEOPLE FEEL TO HAVE PARTS OF THEIR BODY SURGICALLY AMPUTATED. ARMS. LEGS. APPARENTLY, IT IS DRIVEN BY CERTAIN SEXUAL COMPULSIONS.&rdquo; LOVE NODDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. &ldquo;WELL, YOU KNOW SYD BARRETT? ONE OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF PINK FLOYD?&rdquo; &ldquo;NO, I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE I DO,&rdquo; JOHN SAID. &ldquo;WELL, HE WAS AMAZING,&rdquo; LOVE SAID.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREAT, GREAT MUSICIAN. BUT HE WENT COMPLETELY CRAZY AND ATE HIS OWN FINGERS OFF.&rdquo; (THOUGH BARRETT WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXHIBITED PSYCHOTIC BEHAVIOR, HE RETAINED ALL TEN DIGITS UNTIL HE DIED.) JOHN CONSIDERED THIS FOR A MOMENT. THEN HE SAID, &ldquo;I&rsquo;M NOT SURE THAT THAT, TECHNICALLY, WOULD QUALIFY AS A TRUE CASE OF APOTEMNOPHILIA.&rdquo; OWENS, WHO HAD BEEN EAVESDROPPING ON THE CONVERSATION, FOUGHT BACK LAUGHTER. LATER, HE TOLD ME HOW MUCH HE HAD RELISHED THE SIGHT OF HIS FATHER AND LOVE TOGETHER AT DAVE&mdash;AND REI KAWAKUBO JUST INCHES AWAY. &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S WHEN I THINK, MY LIFE IS PERFECT,&rdquo; OWENS SAID. BEFORE THE DINNER BROKE UP, LOVE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE PLANNED TO BE &ldquo;HIGHLY SELECTIVE&rdquo; IN HER ATTENDANCE AT THE REST OF THE FASHION SHOWS THAT WEEK. &ldquo;BUT I HAVE TO COME AND SUPPORT RICK,&rdquo; SHE SAID. &ldquo;I ALWAYS SUPPORT RICK.&rdquo; JOHN LOOKED PUZZLED. &ldquo;SUPPORT?&rdquo; HE SAID. &ldquo;HOW DO YOU MEAN? YOU PUT MONEY&mdash;?&rdquo; &ldquo;SHE MEANS EMOTIONALLY, DAD,&rdquo; OWENS INTERRUPTED. &ldquo;OH,&rdquo; JOHN SAID, AND RESUMED EATING. FASHION WEEK WAS NOT QUITE OVER FOR OWENS. FOUR NIGHTS LATER, HE ATTENDED THE OPENING FOR HIS FURNITURE LINE, AT THE GALERIE PHILIPPE JOUSSE, ON THE LEFT BANK. OWENS&rsquo;S PARENTS DROVE WITH HIM TO THE GALLERY IN A CHAUFFEURED S.U.V. JOHN, WHO WAS SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT, ASKED OWENS HOW HIS FASHION SHOW HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY THE CRITICS. &ldquo;WELL,&rdquo; OWENS REPLIED, &ldquo;SUZY MENKES SEEMED TO LIKE IT QUITE A BIT.&rdquo; (THIS WAS TYPICAL UNDERSTATEMENT. MENKES HAD WRITTEN A RAVE REVIEW, IN WHICH SHE COMPLIMENTED OWENS FOR ACHIEVING NEW ELEGANCE AND SOPHISTICATION WITHOUT SACRIFICING HIS STREET EDGE.) &ldquo;ANY CRITICISMS AT ALL, RICK?&rdquo; JOHN ASKED. &ldquo;ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ANY?&rdquo; OWENS REPLIED. &ldquo;WELL,&rdquo; JOHN SAID. &ldquo;YEAH.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;M AFRAID NOT, DAD,&rdquo; OWENS SAID WITH A CHUCKLE. A MOMENT LATER, HE ADDED, &ldquo;WELL, STYLE.COM DIDN&rsquo;T LIKE THE LOW-CROTCH PANTS MUCH.&rdquo; &ldquo;I SEE,&rdquo; JOHN SAID. BUT THERE WAS NO NOTE OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE. &ldquo;I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HIM LOSING HIS TOUCH,&rdquo; HE HAD TOLD ME A FEW DAYS EARLIER. IN 2004, OWENS WAS OFFERED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR HIS LABEL, AND JOHN WORRIED THAT HIS SON HAD DONE THE WRONG THING BY SAYING NO. &ldquo;YOU GET TO THOSE FIGURES, AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT,&rdquo; JOHN SAID. &ldquo;IF YOU SELL OUT, YOU DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT, YOU&rsquo;RE SET FOR LIFE.&rdquo; I LATER REPEATED JOHN&rsquo;S COMMENT TO OWENS, WHO SMILED. &ldquo;AND THAT&rsquo;S WHY ME AND MY DAD, MUCH AS I LOVE HIM, WILL ALWAYS NEVER QUITE SEE EYE TO EYE ON THINGS,&rdquo; HE SAID. AT THE GALERIE JOUSSE, MEN AND WOMEN, DRESSED IN RICK OWENS DESIGNS, CHATTED AMONG PIECES FROM HIS FURNITURE LINE&mdash;AN UNSETTLING COLLECTION OF CUBE- SHAPED CHAIRS, SOFAS, AND SIDE TABLES UPHOLSTERED IN MINK, SABLE, AND FELT, SOME OF THEM DECORATED WITH DEER ANTLERS. OWENS STOOD IN A CORNER, SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS, INCLUDING LOVE. SOMEONE SUGGESTED THAT THE GROUP HAVE DINNER AT BRASSERIE LIPP. OWENS APPROACHED HIS PARENTS, WHO WERE SITTING ON ONE OF HIS COUCHES, A LONG BENCHLIKE PIECE UPHOLSTERED IN GLOSSY MINK. &ldquo;EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO TO BRASSERIE LIPP,&rdquo; OWENS TOLD THEM, SITTING DOWN BETWEEN HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S SO HIP AND FABULOUS,&rdquo; HE ADDED WEARILY. &ldquo;CAN WE JUST GO HOME?&rdquo; HIS PARENTS SAID YES.

WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FASHION AND ART?&nbsp; FASHION IS AMUSING AND ART IS COMFORTING.&nbsp; IN ART, THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAY OF EXPRESSION. WHAT KIND OF ART ARE YOU INTERESTED IN?&nbsp; I USUALLY LIKE THINGS THAT ARE QUIET AND RESTRAINED AND AMBIGUOUS. I USUALLY DON&#39;T LIKE THINGS THAT ARE ARCH, CONFRONTATIONAL OR SUPERIOR.&nbsp; WHO ARE THE ARTISTS YOU RESPECT THE MOST, AND WHY?&nbsp; I LIKE JULIAN SCHNABEL&#39;S HUNGER FOR GRANDEUR. I LOVE BEUYS&#39;S HOLISTIC POETRY. I&#39;M REASSURED BY BRANCUSI&#39;S CONSISTENCY. I&#39;M IMPRESSED WITH TIM HAWKINSON&#39;S INGENUITY. I&#39;M ENGAGED BY IAN KEIR&#39;S REDUCTIVENESS. I LOVE RACHEL WHITEREAD&#39;S CONTINUING STORY. I COULD GO ON FOREVER.&nbsp; HOW DOES ART INFLUENCE YOUR WORK IN FASHION AND FURNITURE?&nbsp; IT REMINDS ME OF POSSIBILITIES AND COURAGE.&nbsp; WHEN DOES FASHION SPILLS OVER INTO ART?&nbsp; I THINK REI KAWAKUBO SEEMS PRETTY CLOSE, BUT I&#39;M NOT SURE.&nbsp; WHAT DOES THE ACT OF CREATING MEAN IN LIFE?&nbsp; MOMENTUM, PROGRESS AND EGO.&nbsp; WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO BECOME A DESIGNER?&nbsp; I WENT TO ART SCHOOL AND WAS INTIMIDATED BY THE COMMITMENT THAT I FELT WAS NECESSARY TO BECOME AN ARTIST. FASHION SEEMED LIKE THE NEXT BEST THING.&nbsp; HOW DID YOU START YOUR OWN BRAND?&nbsp; I VERY INNOCENTLY THOUGHT THAT IF I JUST KEPT MAKING THINGS AND KEPT PUTTING THEM OUT THERE, EVENTUALLY IT WOULD CATCH THE EYE OF SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP ME FINANCE AND DISTRIBUTE IT, WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED. I DON&#39;T REALLY KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE NOW. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE DESIGNERS THAN THERE USED TO BE. AND, COMING FROM L.A, I WAS ALLOWED TO BUILD A BUSINESS QUIETLY WITHOUT BECOMING HOT AND THEN DISPOSABLE.&nbsp; YOU COME FROM THE MIDDLE OF CALIFORNIA. LATER YOU MOVED TO L.A. TO STUDY IN AN ART SCHOOL. IS THERE ANY INFLUENCE FROM YOUR COUNTRY, THE USA, IN YOUR COLLECTIONS?&nbsp; I SUSPECT THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN AMERICAN DIRECTNESS AND PRAGMATISM THAT COMES THROUGH.&nbsp; SINCE YOU LIVE IN FRANCE, ARE YOU BEING INFLUENCED BY PARIS?&nbsp; SHOWING IN PARIS RAISES THE BAR, FOR SURE. FANTASY AND POETRY ARE DEMANDED HERE. I SEE NO DEMERITS IN BEING BASED HERE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;M SURE, IN THE PARISIAN PRET-A-PORTER BUSINESS, THERE ARE SOME RULES TO FOLLOW. WHAT KIND OF MERITS AND DEMERITS DID YOU FIND OUT?&nbsp; IF THERE ARE RULES, I GUESS I&#39;M NOT AWARE OF THEM OR ELSE MY HEAD JUST DOESN&#39;T REGISTER THEM. THE ONLY RULES I REALLY FOLLOW ARE DEADLINES. YOU CAN HAVE THE MOST POETIC COLLECTION IN THE WORLD BUT IF YOU SHIP IT TOO LATE TO SELL, YOU&#39;RE OUTTA BUSINESS.&nbsp; RIGHT NOW IN MEN&rsquo;S FASHION, THE TRADITIONAL STYLE OF THE AMERICAN EAST COAST IS VERY POPULAR. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS?&nbsp; I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND PREPPIE.&nbsp; IN A NEAR FUTURE, IN WHICH DIRECTION DO YOU THINK MEN&rsquo;S FASHION WILL GO?&nbsp; IT&#39;S BEEN PRETTY RESTRAINED FOR A WHILE. MAYBE IT&#39;S TIME FOR FLAMBOYANCE AGAIN. I HOPE SO.&nbsp; WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR MEN&rsquo;S AND WOMEN&rsquo;S COLLECTIONS?&nbsp; THE WOMEN&#39;S IS MORE ABOUT ALLURE AND THE MEN&#39;S IS MORE RESERVED. BUT THEY&#39;RE BOTH ABOUT THE TOUCH AND DRAPE OF THE FABRIC.

I LOVE WAKING UP EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, GULPING A COFFEE AND GOING THERE FOR THEIR AFTER-HOURS. THE WINDOWS ARE BLACKED OUT, THE FOG MACHINE IS PUMPING AND IT&#39;S PACKED BUT NOT TOO PACKED. IT&#39;S VERY MELLOW OLD SCHOOL. LAST TIME, I LEFT AT 1 PM AND IT WAS STILL GOING STRONG. I LOVE THE PERVERSITY OF DENYING MORNING AND PLUNGING INTO THE DARK ON A COFFEE BUZZ.&nbsp; FIRST PARIS, NOW NYC&mdash;WHICH CITY IS NEXT FOR A STORE OPENING?&nbsp; I KNOW&mdash;NOW I&#39;M HOOKED.

THE WORD SEEMS TO IMPLY FRIVOLOUS WHIM. BUT I HAVE NO BETTER WORD TO OFFER AS A REPLACEMENT.&nbsp; IN OUR LAST INSTALLMENT WE HAD ROBERT FARRELL PHILOSOPHICALLY EXAMINE THE TERM &ldquo;FASHION.&rdquo; HE CONCLUDED, &quot;FASHION EQUIPS US FOR A WORLD THAT HAS LOST SIGHT OF THE EARTH.&quot; WOULD YOU AGREE?&nbsp; VERY POETIC, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.&nbsp; THE MATERIALS YOU DESIGN WITH ARE A STRANGE DICHOTOMY OF SOFT AND HARD, LEATHER VERSUS KNITWEAR. IS THIS REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR PERSONALITY?&nbsp; YEAH, CONTRASTS ARE MORE DRAMATIC.&nbsp; WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO FINISH A COLLECTION? IS IT EVER FINISHED, OR IS IT ALL JUST A CONTINUATION OF SOMETHING LARGER?&nbsp; I USED TO FEEL DISAPPOINTED AND DRAINED. YOU&#39;RE RUNNING FULL SPEED TRYING TO GET TO THE FINISH LINE AND WIN AFTER MONTHS OF TRAINING. YOU GET THERE AND THEN&mdash;YOU&#39;RE DONE. ALL THAT ADRENALINE TURNS INTO POISON AND YOU OBSESS ON ALL YOUR MISTAKES.&nbsp; NOW I&#39;VE GOTTEN MORE USED TO STARTING EARLIER AND LEARNING HOW TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF A COLLECTION AND TO ALREADY BE STARTED ON ANOTHER. SO NOW IT&#39;S MORE OF A ROLLING-ALONG PROCESS. THE HIGHS AREN&#39;T AS HIGH, BUT THERE&#39;S NO CRASH ANYMORE, REALLY.&nbsp; FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, YOU SEEM TO LIVE IN A HAUNTED WORLD, ONE WHICH PEOPLE OFTEN DESCRIBE AS DARK OR PERVERSE. IS THIS A FAIR ASSUMPTION? WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF HAUNTED, AND DOES THAT COME OUT IN YOUR WORK?&nbsp; THE PERVERSITY ISN&#39;T EARNEST. IT WAS THAT MOMENT OF LIBERATION OF SEEING DIVINE&#39;S SHAVED FOREHEAD AND MAKEUP IN &ldquo;PINK FLAMINGOS&rdquo; WHEN I WAS A KID THAT MADE ME FIND MY PLACE IN THE WORLD. I LOVE DRAMA, I LOVE ROMANCE, I LOVE CAMP.&nbsp; WOULD YOU DRESS THE DEVIL IF HE WERE TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO YOU?&nbsp; I GUESS I&#39;D DRAPE HIM IN THE INTERIOR OF MY RECTUM.&nbsp; IN REALITY, AS IT EXISTS TO US THUS FAR, WE ALL DIE. IS THIS REALITY FRIGHTENING FOR YOU?&nbsp; YES. THE FEAR OF DEATH AND THE YEARNING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOTIFS IN WHAT I CREATE AND IN THE CREATIVE WORKS OF OTHERS.&nbsp; LASTLY, OPERATING AS AN EXPAT, DO YOU STILL CONSIDER YOURSELF AN AMERICAN? OR HAS RELOCATING TO EUROPE CHANGED YOUR PERSONAL IDENTITY? DO YOU FEEL YOUR AMERICAN UPBRINGING IN YOUR COLLECTIONS, OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS TRANSCENDED BY YOUR DESIGNS?&nbsp; YOU KNOW, WHEN I MOVED HERE, I WAS SO SELF-CONSCIOUS OF DEVELOPING A PRETENTIOUS EURO ACCENT TO MY ENGLISH THAT I OVERCOMPENSATED AND DEVELOPED AN EVEN MORE EXTREME SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VALLEY DRONE THAN I EVER HAD TO BEGIN WITH. EUROPEAN COMPEXITY AND FORMALITY MAKES ME APPRECIATE AMERICAN BLUNTNESS MORE. AND VICE VERSA. I DEFINITELY SEE AN AMERICAN&#39;S NAIVE INTERPRETATION OF EUROPEAN GLAMOUR IN WHAT I DO.

COULD YOU TELL US WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS, ACCORDING TO YOU, CONCERNING LEATHER?&nbsp; I HAVE TO HAVE A GUT FEELING. THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS ANALYZE IT. OVER TIME I&#39;VE ACCUMULATED ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WITH LEATHER THAT I CAN KIND OF FIGURE HOW IT&#39;S GOING TO TURN OUT.&nbsp; THAT BEING SAID, IT&#39;S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE SINCE YOU&#39;RE DEALING WITH NATURAL ELEMENTS, SO THERE&#39;S ALWAYS THAT ELEMENT OF RISK. AND RISK IS VERY ATTRACTIVE.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU DESIGN GARMENTS, SUCH AS JACKETS, IN LEATHER?&nbsp; YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP THE SIZE OF THE SKINS IN MIND AND WHERE THE SEAMS HAVE TO GO ON THE BODY. SOMETIMES THAT LEADS YOU TO A NEW IDEA.&nbsp; IN YOUR MEN&rsquo;S COLLECTION, DO THE SHOES OCCUPY A PROMINENT PLACE?&nbsp; I THINK THAT YOU CAN WEAR THE MOST BASIC JEANS AND T-SHIRT BUT THE SHOE ALWAYS DEFINES THE OUTFIT.&nbsp; WHEN YOU MAKE SHOES, WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU? DESIGN? FITTING? MATERIAL?&nbsp; I ALWAYS THINK THE FIT SHOULD COME FIRST, THEN THE MATERIAL. DESIGN LAST.&nbsp; IN YOUR PRIVATE LIFE, WHAT KIND OF SHOES DO YOU LIKE BEST?&nbsp; I USED TO HATE SNEAKERS. I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE MOST PROSAIC, CONVENTIONAL, DEPRESSING, MUNDANE SYMBOL OF BOREDOM. I THOUGHT BOOTS WERE MORE FLAMBOYANT, VIRILE AND DIGNIFIED. I DON&rsquo;T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED BUT I CHANGED. IN MY PERSONAL LIFE, I WORK, GO TO THE GYM AND BACK TO WORK. I WOULD FEEL RIDICULOUS HAVING TO CHANGE TWICE A DAY. SO I REPROPORTIONED OLD-SCHOOL BASKETBALL SHOES AND WEAR THEM WITH MY UNIFORM OF LONG BLACK BAGGY GYM SHORTS AND BRIGHT WHITE T-SHIRTS--KIND OF MY ABSTRACTED VERSION OF A &#39;30S MILITARY ACADEMY UNIFORM: FUNCTIONAL, DISCIPLINED, SEVERE AND MINIMAL.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR COMMITMENT WHEN YOU MAKE SHOES?&nbsp; I USUALLY LIKE THINGS THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR A GAY LEATHER BAR.&nbsp; DO YOU DESIGN YOUR SHOES AS A SEPARATE ITEM FROM YOUR COLLECTION? OR DO YOU ALWAYS MAKE MATCHING SHOES TO EACH COLLECTION?&nbsp; SHOES DEFINITELY ARE A SUCH A GREAT WAY TO DEVELOPE EACH COLLECTION&rsquo;S STORY.&nbsp; COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THE SHOES IN THIS SEASON&rsquo;S COLLECTION REFLECT ITS THEME?&nbsp; THE SWIRLING FLAPS OF SHEARLING THIS SEASON MOVED THE ACTION FROM THE BODY. THEY WERE ALMOST AN EXTENSION OF THE CAPES THAT DRIPPED FROM THE SHOULDER TO CREAT A LINE THAT TRAILED AWAY.&nbsp; HOW IMPORTANT ARE THE SHOES IN YOUR COLLECTION IN GENERAL?&nbsp; PARAMOUNT.&nbsp; DO YOU FIND ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING CLOTHES AND MAKING SHOES?&nbsp; I KNOW LESS ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF SHOES SO THE PROCESS IS A LOT MORE ARDUOUS.&nbsp; FOR SHOES, I SUPPOSE THAT YOU NEED TO USE DIFFERENT FACTORY AND PROCESS FROM THE OTHER ITEMS IN YOUR COLLECTION. WHEN YOU CHOOSE THE FACTORY FOR YOUR SHOE COLLECTION, WHAT IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL THING FOR YOU?&nbsp; PUNCTUALITY.

THE ART IS LEE BONTECOU&rsquo;S ASSEMBLAGES OF METAL, CANVAS AND DENIM. I&rsquo;VE LIKED HER FOR A LONG TIME AND FINALLY HAD A GOOD MOMENT TO FOCUS ON HER.&nbsp; THE OTHER WAS A SILHOUETTE FROM THE BAND KISS. I&rsquo;D BEEN LOOKING AT THEIR EARLY PERFORMANCES FROM THE &#39;70S WHEN THEIR AESTHETIC WAS MORE DO-IT-YOURSELF. I MISS THE SPIRIT OF THOSE PERFORMANCES-- DYONISIAN, TRANSGRESSIVE BUT WITH GOOD-NATURED CAMP.&nbsp; SEASON AFTER SEASON, WHAT&#39;S THE BRAND&#39;S SIGNATURE AESTHETIC IDENTITY? AND WHAT&#39;S THE BRAND&#39;S MAIN INSPIRATION?&nbsp; I GREW UP IN A SMALL CONSERVATIVE TOWN AND WENT TO A CATHOLIC SCHOOL. I&rsquo;VE REALIZED RECENTLY HOW STRONG OF AN IMPACT THAT CATHOLIC IMAGERY MADE ON ME. SPIRITUALLY ELEVATED CHARACTERS IN DRAGGING ROBES IN DUSTY TEMPLES WERE AN EXOTIC AND GLAMOROUS IMAGE FOR A YOUNG SISSY TO CLING TO. IS THAT A DESIGNER CLICH&Eacute;? I&rsquo;VE KEPT THAT LONG GREY LINE AS A CONSTANT, AND IT&rsquo;S BEEN WORKING FOR ME SO FAR. D&Eacute;FIL&Eacute;S ARE GREAT FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH A FLAMBOYANCE I PROBABLY WOULD NEVER HAVE PERMITTED MYSELF, AND I LIKE TO THINK ADD FRESH ENERGY TO MY MAIN LOOK.&nbsp; SHOULD FASHION DESIGNERS AND BRANDS MAINTAIN A CONSTANT, RECOGNIZABLE STYLE IN ALL THEIR COLLECTIONS, OR CAN THEY AND SHOULD THEY MAKE SIGNIFICANT AESTHETIC CHANGES?&nbsp; THERE DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO BE ANY RULES. I&rsquo;VE ALWAYS PREFERRED DESIGNERS, ARTISTS OR ARCHITECTS THAT ARE COMMITED TO A PERSONAL VISION AND I&rsquo;VE TRIED TO FOLLOW THAT ROUTE. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE DESIGNERS THAT MAKE EXTREME CHANGES THAT ARE DARING AND EXCITING TO WATCH.&nbsp; CREATIVITY-WISE, WHAT&#39;S MORE COMPLEX: CREATING THE AESTHETIC IDENTITY OF A NEW BRAND OR MAKING THE CREATIVE PERSONALITY OF A BRAND WITH HISTORY AND TRADITION EVOLVE WITH THE TIMES?&nbsp; I HAVE NO IDEA. I WOULDN&rsquo;T ENJOY INTERPRETING SOMEONE ELSE&#39;S VISION FOR VERY LONG TIME. I&rsquo;M PRETTY SELFISH AND SPOILED AND ONLY KNOW HOW TO DO WHAT I WANT. INTERPRETATION IS AN ADMIRABLE SKILL THAT I&rsquo;M AFRAID I WOULD BE A FAILURE AT.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S THE BEST IDEA YOU REMEMBER COMING ACROSS TO DESIGN A COLLECTION (WHETHER IT&#39;S DUE TO GOOD REVIEWS, RESULTS OR PERSONAL SATISFACTION)?&nbsp; I LIKED THE SEASON IN WHICH WE DID ALL THE SKIRTS WITH STIFF FOLDS, CREATING VOLUME IN FRONT THAT WE REFERRED TO AS BONERS [AN AMERICAN EXPRESSION FOR ERECTIONS]. I GIGGLED FOR WEEKS TO HEAR EVERYONE REFERRING TO THE &ldquo;BONER SKIRTS&rdquo; AT THE FACTORY. THAT&rsquo;S THE ONLY EXAMPLE THAT I COULD COME UP WITH TO THAT QUESTION. ALL THE REFERENCES THAT GO INTO A COLLECTION ARE SO INTERWOVEN THAT I WOULDN&rsquo;T BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THEM. NOR WOULD I WANT TO. I DON&rsquo;T THINK IT&rsquo;S FUN TO ANALYZE TOO MUCH. EITHER IT CLICKS OR IT DOESN&rsquo;T.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S THE WORST IDEA YOU REMEMBER COMING ACROSS TO DESIGN A COLLECTION (WHETHER IT&#39;S DUE TO BAD REVIEWS, PROBLEMS IN ITS REALIZATION OR BAD RESULTS)?&nbsp; WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING SHOWS I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO COLLABORATE MORE AND INVITE NEW ENERGY AND IDEAS INTO MY PERSONAL SPACE. I WAS REALLY WRONG AND HAD TO GET RID OF EVERYONE AND LISTEN TO MYSELF. FOR BETTER OR WORSE, I&rsquo;M A LONER AND CAN&rsquo;T USE OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S CREATIVITY EFFECTIVELY. SOME DESIGNERS ARE GREAT AT THAT. IT SEEMS I&rsquo;M NOT.&nbsp; DO TRENDS IN FASHION SERVE YOU AS AN INSPIRATION, OR ARE THEY INSPIRATION&#39;S WORST ENEMIES?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M A FASHION FAN AND SOMETIMES THERE&rsquo;S SOMETHING IN THE AIR THAT SEEMS FRESH AND A LOT OF TIMES THERE&rsquo;S STUFF TO REACT AGAINST. NOTHING&rsquo;S REALLY NEW, AND THE SPEED OF FASHION NOW HAS CREATED SUCH A BLUR THAT VIRTUALLY NOTHING&rsquo;S TABOO OR WRONG NOW. THIS GENERATION&#39;S SENSE OF IRONY CAN KIND OF ACCEPT ANYTHING AS FABULOUS NOW.&nbsp; YOU MAY REMEMBER SEEING A GENIUS IDEA IN ANOTHER DESIGNER&#39;S COLLECTION AND THINKING &quot;WHY DIDN&#39;T THAT OCCUR TO ME?&quot;. IS SEEING OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S GOOD IDEAS A STIMULUS TO MAKE YOU THINK?&nbsp; SURE. A LITTLE COMPETITION IS INVIGORATING AND MAKES YOU RISE TO THE OCCASION.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE STEALING YOUR IDEAS? DO YOU FEEL FLATTERED? FRUSTRATED? FURIOUS? INDIFFERENT?&nbsp; I ALWAYS ASSUME THAT IT WAS NEVER MY IDEA TO START WITH. I PROBABLY FELT SOMETHING IN THE AIR AROUND THE SAME TIME AS EVERYONE ELSE.&nbsp; HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU WORK ON A DAILY AVERAGE?&nbsp; ALL THE TIME. ALTHOUGH I WOULDN&rsquo;T REALLY CALL IT WORK.&nbsp; DO YOU SPEND MORE TIME THINKING OR MAKING?&nbsp; IT&rsquo;S MORE LIKE MANEUVERING AN ARMY. THE CREATIVE MOMENTS ARE JUST GRABBED AT FLEETINGLY. THE TRICKY PART IS THE EXECUTION.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S THE BEST IDEA YOU&#39;VE SEEN LATELY&mdash;IN ANY FIELD: FASHION, SCIENCE, POLITICS, TV, MUSIC, SPORTS...&nbsp; DANCING. I HADN&rsquo;T GONE TO CLUBS IN YEARS BECAUSE THE MAIN REASONS TO GO ARE TO GET HIGH AND GET LAID. I DON&rsquo;T NEED TO DO EITHER ANYMORE. BUT RECENTLY, I&rsquo;VE BEEN GOING BY MYSELF TO AFTER-HOUR CLUBS EARLY ON SUNDAY MORNINGS. I LIKE THAT KIND OF CREEPY DARKNESS. AND DANCING IS SUCH A SIMPLE, PRIMAL AND PURE EXPRESSION OF JOY. I GET LOST FOR HOURS. Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?&nbsp; IT WAS A QUOTE FROM A FAMOUS PARISIAN SHOWGIRL NAMED CECILE SOREL WHO USED TO SAY IT TO THE AUDIENCE AFTER MAKING HER GRAND ENTRANCE ONSTAGE, DESCENDING A LONG STAIRCASE IN A HUGE FEATHER OUTFIT. IT MEANS &ldquo;HOW WELL DID I DESCEND?&rdquo; TAKING IT OUT OF THAT CONTEXT, I LIKED THE OMINOUS CONNOTATION.&nbsp; HOW DID THIS EVOLVE INTO A BRAND BOOK? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHOW THROUGH IT?&nbsp; I HAD ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO MAKE A HANDBOOK FOR NEW EMPLOYEES TO SHOW THEM WHAT THE BRAND WAS ABOUT AND WHAT I WANTED IT TO BE. AFTER COMPILING IT, I THOUGHT MAYBE SOME OF OUR CLIENTS MIGHT LIKE IT, TOO.&nbsp; WHAT DID THE BOOK ALLOW YOU TO EXPRESS?&nbsp; IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXERCISE TO ISOLATE WHATEVER I FELT I DID GRACEFULLY AND ELIMINATE WHATEVER I CONSIDERED AWKWARD OR UNRESOLVED. I WISH IT WERE AS EASY IN REAL LIFE. I WANTED TO EXAMINE WHAT I&rsquo;D DONE CALMLY, SUMMARIZED. I&rsquo;M AFRAID THAT IT WAS A VERY SELFISH INDULGENCE.&nbsp; THIS IS A BOOK WITH BLACK-AND-WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS. WHAT DOES BLACK REPRESENT FOR YOU?&nbsp; I GET TIRED OF THINGS EASILY IN COLOR. BLACK AND WHITE IS LESS INTRUSIVE AND GIVES EVERYTHING A SENSE OF GRAVITAS AND ELEGANCE. TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE AND STRIP IMAGES DOWN TO SILHOUETTES AND HIGHLIGHTS IS PLEASANT FOR ME. IT&rsquo;S JUST ONE TINY STEP LESS CLOSE TO CHAOS.&nbsp; I HEARD THAT YOU TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALMOST ALL THE PHOTOS IN THE BOOK.&nbsp; I DON&rsquo;T PRETEND TO BE A GREAT PHOTOGRAPHER, BUT WHEN IT&rsquo;S A PERSONAL EXPRESSION, I DON&rsquo;T THINK YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A MISTAKE. I LIKE THE IDEA OF CAPTURING AND APPRECIATING PERFECT MOMENTS. MANIPULATED OR NOT. I&rsquo;M NOT PRESENTING THIS AS AN ART BOOK, BUT AS A PERSONAL ALBUM.&nbsp; WHAT BOOKS OR VISUAL WORKS INSPIRE YOU?&nbsp; MY FAVORITE PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK IS &ldquo;BUNKER ARCHAEOLOGY&rdquo; BY PAUL VIRILIO. HE DOCUMENTED WORLD WAR II BUNKERS ON THE FRENCH ATLANTIC COAST AFTER THE WAR. THEY&rsquo;RE ABANDONED CONCRETE FORMS THAT LOOK LIKE ALIEN BAUHAUS TEMPLES TO ME. I LIKE TO PRETEND THAT MY CLOTHES BELONG IN THEM.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR NEXT STEP?&nbsp; I&rsquo;LL BE OPENING STORES IN NEW YORK AND LONDON THIS SUMMER, FOLLOWING THE OPENING OF THE PARIS STORE A YEAR AGO.

AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO GO INTO FASHION?&nbsp; I JUST WANTED TO BE BAD-ASS AND GLAMOROUS.&nbsp; YOU SET UP YOUR LABEL IN 1994 AND HAVE BEEN DESIGNING FOR ALMOST 15 YEARS. WHAT WERE THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF YOUR CAREER?&nbsp; I DON&rsquo;T REMEMBER ANY SPECIFIC LOWS, JUST A DULL SENSE OF SCRAPING ALONG. LATER, I DO REMEMBER HEARING MY FAVORITE SISTERS OF MERCY SONG WHILE I WAS BEING DRIVEN TO MY FACTORY THROUGH THE FOGGY ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE EARLY ONE MORNING AND FINDING MYSELF CRYING. I WAS HEARING THAT SONG UNDER SUCH DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THAN WHEN I FIRST USED TO HEAR IT IN MY YOUNGER DAYS.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU THINK FASHION HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU STARTED? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT EVOLUTION?&nbsp; EVEN IN MY RELATIVELY SHORT EXPERIENCE IT&rsquo;S ACCELERATED. AND EVERY COMPANY&rsquo;S STRATEGIES AND MACHINATIONS ARE COMPLETELY EXPOSED. EVERY CONSUMER IS COMPLETELY AWARE OF EVERY MEASURE BEING TAKEN TO SEDUCE THEM.&nbsp; SO THE METHODS OF SEDUCTION NEED TO SHIFT. AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SEDUCED. I&rsquo;M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW IT&rsquo;S GONNA CHANGE, BUT I&rsquo;M WATCHING.&nbsp; HOW IMPORTANT IS BEAUTY TO YOU? WHAT IS IT THAT ATTRACTS YOU IN A PERSON?&nbsp; ANYONE, ANYONE CAN BE WILDLY ATTRACTIVE BY MAKING THEMSELVES FIT, BY GROOMING, AND BY HAVING AN OPEN HEART AND AN EASY LAUGH.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU ENVISAGE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOUR FURNITURE DESIGN, PHOTOGRAPHY AND FASHION WORK? DO ALL FIELDS FEED EACH OTHER?&nbsp; YEAH, IT&rsquo;S ALL ONE BIG PACKAGE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE.&nbsp; DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR WORK PERSONAL OR AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL? AND IF SO, IN WHICH WAYS?&nbsp; IF I EXPLAINED THAT, I&rsquo;D RUIN ANY POETRY IN IT.&nbsp; YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO MICHELE LAMY HAS BEEN PIVOTAL IN YOUR LIFE AND CAREER. IN WHAT WAYS IS SHE UNIQUE AND INDISPENSABLE?&nbsp; I HAVE WONDERFUL BUSINESS PARTNERS BUT MICHELE FILLS ANOTHER, MORE SUBTLE ROLE; SHE&rsquo;S ABOUT REFINEMENTS AND LOOKING UPWARD AND ONWARDS. AND REMINDING ME TO EAT AND PLAY. I THANK MY STARS FOR HER EVERY DAY.&nbsp; ARE THERE ANY ARTISTS, FILMMAKERS OR MUSICIANS YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO GO BACK TO? AND WHO ARE THE ONES THAT CURRENTLY EXCITE YOU THE MOST?&nbsp; OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD: BRANCUSI, JEAN MICHEL-FRANK, COLANI, RUHLMANN, CHAREAU, HUYSMANS, DIVINE, BRODOVITCH, WAGNER, IAN KEIR, AUTECHRE, OLD SCHOOL HOUSE MUSIC, AC/DC, SATYAJIT RAY, CHARLOTTE RAMPLING, KLAUS NOMI.&nbsp; ARE THERE ANY OBJECTS OR PLACES THAT YOU CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT?&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOUR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE? DO YOU STILL HAVE MANY DREAMS THAT ARE NOT FULFILLED?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M LOOKING FORWARD TO ENDING UP PLAYING WITH A KITTEN IN A WALLED GARDEN.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR ESCAPE PLAN WHEN IT ALL BECOMES TOO MUCH? WHERE DO YOU FIND REFUGE?&nbsp; I TAKE A ONE-HOUR NAP EVERY DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY.

IT REMINDED ME OF ONE OF THOSE ITALIAN OCCULT HORROR MOVIES FROM THE &#39;70S. I ALWAYS DO THE MUSIC WITH A FRIEND OF MINE FROM L.A. THAT I&#39;VE KNOWN FOR 20 YEARS. WHEN I MOVED TO EUROPE, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WOULDN&#39;T DRIFT APART, WHICH HAPPENS. SO DOING THE MUSIC TOGETHER TWICE A YEAR MAKES SURE THAT DOESN&#39;T HAPPEN. WE WORK ON IT BY EMAIL AND ON THE PHONE FOR A MONTH BEFORE THE SHOW, RE-ARRANGING AND TWEAKING AND CHOPPING UP AND DISTORTING. SOMETIMES IT COMES OUT SOUNDING ALMOST NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL. THIS ONE WAS CLOSE TO PERFECT ALREADY, THOUGH. SOMETIMES THE BEST DESIGN IS TO KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE SOMETHING ALONE.

SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHO WOULD WEAR THE RICK OWENS DRESSES THAT EXPOSED THE MODELS&rsquo; BREASTS. OLGA WAS TOO BUSY TEXTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION. IT WAS MOOT ANYHOW, SINCE THE MODELS WERE ALREADY PAIRED UP WITH THE OUTFITS THEY WOULD EACH WEAR FOR EACH EXIT, AND THERE WERE NO REAL DECISIONS FOR THEM TO MAKE. THERE REALLY NEVER ARE. IT&rsquo;S FUNNY TO THINK BACK ON THE DAYS OF THE SO-CALLED SUPERMODELS &mdash; FOUR SPOILED WOMEN WHOSE CAREERS SOME PEOPLE IN THE PRESS ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO REVIVE &mdash; AND THEIR INFAMOUS BACKSTAGE ANTICS. THERE WERE LINDA&rsquo;S IMPERIOUS FOOT STAMPINGS ABOUT RUNWAY PRECEDENCE. THERE WERE NAOMI&rsquo;S TANTRUMS ABOUT, WELL, ANYTHING. (INCLUDING A LUNCH AT LE GRAND VEFOUR, WHERE SHE ORDERED, OF ALL THINGS TO EAT AT A HALLOWED TEMPLE OF HAUTE CUISINE, A CLUB SANDWICH AND THEN SENT IT BACK BECAUSE THE BREAD WAS SCRAPING HER GUMS.) THERE WAS THE UNWELCOME PRESENCE AT SHOWS OF ONE MODEL&rsquo;S BOOKER WITH WHAT SEEMED LIKE A STOPWATCH, CLOCKING THE BILLABLE HOURS AS THEY TICKED BY. THE MOVIE-LOT THEATRICALITY OF THOSE TIMES HAS LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED FROM THE RICH BACKSTAGE REALM, WHICH ITSELF SHOWS ALARMING SIGNS OF DYING OUT AS DESIGNERS LIKE MARC JACOBS AND DONNA KARAN AND DONATELLA VERSACE RESTRICT THE ACCESS THAT HAS FOR SO LONG BEEN A PART OF KEEPING THE IMAGE MACHINE STOKED. &ldquo;WHEN I STARTED OUT 20 YEARS AGO, THERE WAS NO ONE BACKSTAGE, BECAUSE NOBODY WANTED TO BE THERE,&rdquo; SAID THE PHOTOGRAPHER ROXANNE LOWIT. &ldquo;PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY NOT TO DO THE RUNWAY AND SPEND ALL MY TIME BACKSTAGE. BUT THAT&rsquo;S WHERE THE MAGIC IS.&rdquo; THAT&rsquo;S WHERE YOU WOULD WITNESS A THEATER AS FASCINATING AS ANY SPECTACLE ON ANY RUNWAY, WHERE CRAMMED INTO SOME UNLIKELY SPACE THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE, AS AT MR. OWENS&rsquo;S SHOW, RELATED BUT ONLY MARGINALLY COMPATIBLE ECOLOGIES LIKE THOSE OF HAIRDRESSING, MAKEUP, FOOD SERVICES AND DRESSING THROWN TOGETHER FOR TWO HARRIED HOURS AND CONJURING OUT OF THE TUMULT A CLEAR 15-MINUTE DISTILLATION OF THE DESIGNER&rsquo;S DREAM. THERE YOU&rsquo;LL ENCOUNTER THE UNASSUMING HAIRDRESSING GENIUS WHO LOOKS LIKE A GARDEN GNOME AND WHOSE ANNUAL EARNINGS ARE RIGHT UP THERE WITH A SENIOR EXECUTIVE IN THE FORTUNE 500. THERE YOU&rsquo;LL MEET THE ETHEREAL CANADIAN MODEL WHO GREW UP ON A PIG FARM AND WAS DISCOVERED AT A DOUGHNUT SHOP. RIGHT NOW SHE&rsquo;S CHEWING GUM AND FIDDLING WITH HER SOLID GOLD MEN&rsquo;S ROLEX WHILE CHATTING UP A FELLOW CANADIAN OF LUNAR BEAUTY, A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE BIG BREAK CAME WHEN A MODELING AGENT HAPPENED UPON HER DURING A HOSTESS SHIFT AT EAST SIDE MARIO&rsquo;S. &ldquo;WHERE IN THE WORLD WOULD I BE IF THAT HADN&rsquo;T HAPPENED?&rdquo; THAT WOMAN, THE MODEL ALANA ZIMMER, SAID ON SUNDAY. PERHAPS SHE WOULD HAVE WORKED PART TIME WHILE FINISHING COLLEGE. PERHAPS SHE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A JOB THAT PAID SOMETHING IN THE MID-FIVE FIGURES. PERHAPS SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN WHAT IT&rsquo;S LIKE TO EARN IN A SEASON THE EQUIVALENT OF A CHIEF EXECUTIVE SALARY WHILE DOING A JOB THAT, SHE SAID, &ldquo;I NEVER TALK ABOUT TO ANYONE BACK HOME,&rdquo; IN KITCHENER, ONTARIO. &ldquo;I NEVER EXPLAIN WHAT I DO,&rdquo; SHE ADDED, AS THE DRESSERS BEGAN FITTING THE MODELS INTO CLOTHES THAT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING FUTURISTIC NUNS MIGHT WEAR IN A MARGARET ATWOOD NOVEL AND WITH GAITERS THAT WRAPPED AROUND THEIR ANKLES AND MADE THE WOMEN SEEM TO HAVE NOT FEET BUT HOOVES. &ldquo;YOU NEVER COULD,&rdquo; SHE SAID. BY NOW IT&rsquo;S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE OF FASHION IS AT LEAST AS COMMERCIALLY VITAL AS THE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD ENTERPRISE OF SELLING CLOTHES. AN AWFUL LOT DEPENDS ON THE LUSH VISUAL CONTENT FASHION CRANKS OUT. AFTER ALL, LITTLE ELSE TRANSLATES AS WELL ACROSS CULTURES, OTHER THAN SPORTING EVENTS AND ACTION FILMS; AND THERE IS PROBABLY NO PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT ENSORCELLED BY THE IMAGE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN ON PARADE. DOES IT MATTER EXACTLY WHAT OR &ldquo;WHO&rdquo; THEY ARE WEARING? TO MOST PEOPLE IT PROBABLY DOES NOT. AND SO IT SOUNDED PARTICULARLY INAPPOSITE WHEN A CHORUS OF HAND-WRINGERS STARTED RAISING A COLLECTIVE PLAINT ABOUT THE INAPPROPRIATENESS OF ATTENDING TO STUFF SO APPARENTLY INESSENTIAL AS FASHION IN &ldquo;THESE HARD TIMES.&rdquo; YET, STANDING AMID THE GAIETY AND TEEN-GIRL HIGH SPIRITS BACKSTAGE AT RICK OWENS &mdash; A BLUR OF MODELS POSING, PHOTOGRAPHERS SNAPPING, HAIRDRESSERS DARTING FROM ONE WOMAN TO THE NEXT AND, AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL, THE MUSCLED GOTH FIGURE OF MR. OWENS HIMSELF &mdash; IT SEEMED ALTOGETHER OBVIOUS THAT THE NEED IS NEVER GREATER FOR ESCAPIST SILLINESS, THE BREAD-AND-CIRCUSES FRIVOLITY OF PAINT AND GLITTER THAN IN TIMES AS TOUGH AS THOSE WE FIND OURSELVES IN. &ldquo;FUN, FUN, FUN,&rdquo; THE MODEL IRINA LAZAREANU KEPT SAYING ON SUNDAY, AS SHE DARTED MANICALLY BACKSTAGE HOLDING AN UNLIGHTED CIGARETTE IN A WAY THAT MADE HER LOOK LIKE GROUCHO MARX, BUT MORE CHIC. &ldquo;WE USED TO HAVE FUN,&rdquo; SAID THE MODEL. &ldquo;WHERE&rsquo;S THE FUN?!&rdquo; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

IT&#39;S A 17TH CENTURY BUILDING LOOKING ONTO THE PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON. IT&#39;S GOT A TRADITIONAL GRAND FACADE AND 5 FLOORS OF CONCRETE &#39;50S OFFICE BUILDING IN BACK OVERLOOKING THE GARDENS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. IT&#39;S ALL BEEN STRIPPED AND LEFT RAW. ARE YOU PROUD OF STILL BEEING AN INDEPENDENT DESIGNER?&nbsp; SURE.&nbsp; YOUR WORK SEEMS TO BE ONE EVOLVING PROCESS, NOT SEASON-RELATED. DOES IT BOTHER YOU SOMETIMES TO BE &quot;FORCED&quot; TO PRESENT FOUR COLLECTIONS PER YEAR AT A CERTAIN POINT IN TIME?&nbsp; I FIND IT STIMULATING. IT USED TO STRESS ME OUT AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I DID FEEL PRESSURED TO DO SOMETHING NEW ALL THE TIME. NOW I&#39;VE REALIZED THAT I CAN DO IT HOWEVER I WANT. IT&#39;S A PLEASURE TO REINTERPRET AND REFINE MY ORIGINAL CONCEPT. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL BE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT FOREVER, BUT I&#39;M OK WITH THAT.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S THE MAIN FUNCTION OF FASHION?&nbsp; BEAUTY IS ONE OF LIFE&#39;S GREATEST REWARDS.&nbsp; ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE WORK OF OTHER CONTEMPORARY FASHION DESIGNERS?&nbsp; SURE. I&#39;M A FASHION FAN.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT &quot;CALIFORNIAN STYLE&quot; EXEMPLIFIED BY CHRISTIAN AUDIGIER, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY A LOT OF CELEBRITIES?&nbsp; UNFAMILIAR WITH IT.&nbsp; DOES THE PRESS INFLUENCE YOUR WORK?&nbsp; PROBABLY. ANY CRITICISM, NO MATTER HOW FAR-FETCHED, USUALLY HAS A GRAIN OF TRUTH. WHY NOT LEARN FROM THAT?&nbsp; WHAT INSPIRES YOU?&nbsp; I LOOK AT ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN BOOKS A LOT. CHARLOTTE PERRIAND, LOUIS KAHN, CARLO MOLLINO, JEAN MICHEL-FRANK, THAT KIND OF STUFF. THOSE TIMELESS PROPORTIONS ARE VERY SOOTHING AND PUT ME IN A RATIONAL FRAME OF MIND.&nbsp; WHICH OTHER CREATIVE DISCIPLINES INFLUENCE YOUR WORK?&nbsp; I LOOK AT ARTISTS LIKE PAUL KOOIKER, BRANCUSI, STEPHEN PARRINO, AND READ A LOT OF BIOGROPHIES LIKE STEPHEN TENNANT&#39;S AND ROBERT DE MONTESQUIOU&#39;S.&nbsp; WHAT ABOUT MUSIC?&nbsp; JULIE LONDON, DAVE CLARKE, KISS, MONTSERRAT CABALLE.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S THE THEME OF YOUR NEXT COLLECTION?&nbsp; CRUST. TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE COVERINGS THAT FALL OFF AND DECOMPOSE, REVEALING NEW STRENGTH UNDERNEATH.&nbsp; YOU RECENTLY LAUNCHED YOUR FURNITURE COLLECTION. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE PIECES AND YOUR CONCEPT BEHIND THE LINE?&nbsp; I WANTED TO FURNISH MY HOUSE, BUT ALL THE RUHLMANN FURNITURE I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FILL IT WITH WAS TOO EXPENSIVE, TOO SHINY AND TOO SMALL. SO I MADE MY OWN.&nbsp; WHERE CAN PEOPLE BUY RICK OWENS FURNITURE?&nbsp; I SELL IT THROUGH GALERIE JOUSSE IN PARIS.&nbsp; COULD YOU IMAGINE STOPPING THE FASHION THING ONE DAY COMPLETELY TO CONCENTRATE ON INTERIORS OR ARCHITECTURE?&nbsp; PROBABLY NOT. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, I&#39;M ADDICTED TO THE FASHION PACE NOW. WAITING 7 YEARS TO GET A BUILDING UP WOULD F CKING KILL ME.&nbsp; DO YOU STILL WORK FOR REVILLON?&nbsp; NO. THEY SIMPLY DIDN&#39;T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO WHAT A LUXURY HOUSE HAS TO DO. AND MAYBE I WASN&#39;T THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THEM TO ATTRACT INVESTORS WITH. WHO KNOWS. MAYBE THEIR NEXT STEP WILL BE A HUGE SUCCESS.&nbsp; WHAT&#39;S SO FASCINATING ABOUT FURS?&nbsp; I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WORKING AS A DESIGNER FOR A MAISON WAS A SELLOUT FOR DESIGNERS AFRAID OF COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO THE RISK OF DOING THEIR OWN THING. BUT REVILLON WAS SPECIFICALLY A FRENCH FUR MAISON PEAKING IN FIN-DE-SIECLE PARIS: MY NE PLUS ULTRA OF RARIFIED ARTIFICE AND GLAMOUR. PROUST&#39;S MOTHER AND SARAH BERNHARDT WORE REVILLON FURS. I COULDN&#39;T RESIST. AND IF MARBLE IS A STEP BEYOND STONE FOR A SCULPTOR, FUR IS A STEP BEYOND LEATHER FOR A DESIGNER. THE TOUCH OF FUR IS A MIRACLE THAT CAN&#39;T BE DUPLICATED. LIKE THE WARMTH OF WOOD OR THE RICHNESS OF A FISTFUL OF EARTH.&nbsp; WHAT DO LUXURY AND DECAY MEAN TO YOU?&nbsp; THERE&#39;S A MOMENT JUST PAST ITS PEAK WHEN A FLOWER GIVES OFF ITS STRONGEST SCENT. ITS LAST GASP. THERE&#39;S ALSO A MOMENT IN MOST OPERAS WHEN THE HEROINE&#39;S ARIA REACHES A TRANSCENDENT PEAK WHERE THERE&#39;S NOWHERE TO GO FROM, AND SHE DIES. I LIKE THAT IDEA OF EXTREME, ULTIMATE SENSATION. AND I LOVE THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF IT.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU STAGE YOUR PERSONAL DECAY?&nbsp; DO I STAGE IT OR HAS IT BECOME REAL?&nbsp; PLEASE DEFINE &quot;BEAUTY.&quot;&nbsp; ONE OF LIFE&#39;S GREAT MYSTERIES, LIKE LOVE AND DEATH.&nbsp; ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEATH?&nbsp; I THOUGHT I WASN&#39;T WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND THEN GOT TOO CLOSE TO IT. IT&#39;S A GOOD LESSON THAT MAKES ONE MORE APPRECIATIVE LATER.&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOU BELIEVING IN?&nbsp; REASON AND ORDER.&nbsp; YOUR GIRLFRIEND, MICHELE LAMY, PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR YOUR LIFE AND WORK. CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP?&nbsp; SHE REMINDS ME TO BE HUMAN. SHE&#39;S ALL INTUITION WHERE I&#39;M TOO PRACTICAL. SHE&#39;S THE INCENSE AND VEILS BEHIND MY CONCRETE WALLS.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE FRENCH MENTALITY?&nbsp; I DON&#39;T REALLY PERSONALLY ENGAGE WITH FRANCE. I&#39;M JUST A VISITOR.&nbsp; DO YOU FEEL DESIRE FOR LOS ANGELES SOMETIMES?&nbsp; NOT REALLY. I&#39;M NOT VERY SENTIMENTAL, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER BEACHES TO VISIT.&nbsp; CAN YOU IMAGINE RETURNING ONE DAY?&nbsp; ONE DAY MY PARENTS WILL BE TOO TIRED TO VISIT.&nbsp; AND THE FINAL QUESTION: WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE USA?&nbsp; THE PEOPLE&#39;S CHOICE.

WHAT WAS THE TRIGGER?&nbsp; I THINK IT WAS WHEN I SAW MUGLER&#39;S ADS FOR HIS METROPOLIS COLLECTION IN THE &#39;70S. HIS HEROIC, EXAGGERATED FIGURES IN PSEUDO-FASCIST UNIFORMS ON MODERNIST BUILDINGS. THAT AND BOWIE, KLAUS NOMI AND DIVINE.&nbsp; DID YOU BECOME A DESIGNER BY ACCIDENT OR WAS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY WANTED TO DO?&nbsp; I WENT TO ART SCHOOL TO BE A PAINTER BUT CHICKENED OUT. I THOUGHT I&#39;D BETTER LEARN A TRADE SO I WENT TO TRADE SCHOOL TO LEARN TO MAKE PATTERNS. I WAS INTERESTED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLOTHES, AND, THINKING PRACTICALLY, I&#39;D ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET A JOB AS A PATTERN MAKER. I STILL FIND A CERTAIN COMFORT IN THAT.&nbsp; WHAT WAS IT LIKE DESIGNING IN L.A.? WAS IT AN EXCITING TIME FOR YOU?&nbsp; IT WAS GREAT. I HAD A QUIET ISOLATED LITTLE CORNER OFF OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AND COULD BLAST IGGY POP ALL NIGHT WORKING BY MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.&nbsp; A WHOLE GENERATION OF DESIGNERS GAINED PROMINENCE IN THE MID &#39;90S, CHANGING PEOPLE&rsquo;S PERCEPTION OF FASHION AND DRESSING. DID YOU, AT ANY POINT, FEEL PART OF A GROUP OR MOVEMENT?&nbsp; I FEEL PART OF A NATURAL EVOLUTION.&nbsp; IS FASHION PURELY SUPERFICIAL OR DOES IT HAVE A DEEPER PURPOSE?&nbsp; IT&#39;S ONE OF THE MOST DIRECT WAYS OF COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER. AND SINCE WHEN IS THE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY SUPERFICIAL? IT&#39;S ONE OF LIFE&#39;S GREATEST REWARDS. BUT MAYBE THE PACE THE FASHION SYSTEM HAS TAKEN ON MIGHT CONSUME IDEAS AND PEOPLE MORE THAN IT SHOULD.&nbsp; ARE APPEARANCES ALWAYS DECEIVING?&nbsp; I DON&#39;T KNOW. I RARELY LOOK.&nbsp; WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU LOVE ABOUT YOUR WORK? AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU COULD REALLY DO WITHOUT?&nbsp; I LIKE CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING, QUIETLY AND ALONE.&nbsp; COMMUNICATING TECHNICAL DETAILS CAN BE TEDIOUS.&nbsp; YOU HAVE USED FUR AND ANIMAL SKINS FOR YEARS AND I LOVE THE WAY YOU&rsquo;VE TAKEN ALL THE BOURGEOIS CONNOTATIONS OUT OF THEM. HOW DO YOU APPROACH SUCH MATERIALS?&nbsp; I PICTURE BRANCUSI&#39;S STUDIO, JOSEPH BEUYS&#39; INSTALLATIONS, MADAME GRES&#39; TURBAN AND THEY TELL ME WHAT TO DO.&nbsp; WHAT DOES LUXURY MEAN TO YOU? IS IT ONLY MATERIAL OR DOES IT HAVE MANY FACES?&nbsp; LUXURY TO ME IS A COFFEE BUZZ, FREE TIME, OPEN SPACE AND LITTLE BAGGAGE.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FASHION&rsquo;S SCHIZOPHRENIC WAVES AND STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF?&nbsp; I LIVE IN MY OWN LITTLE SELFISH BUBBLE.&nbsp; IS FASHION GOING TOO FAST? ARE WE CLOSE TO BURNOUT?&nbsp; I HOPE SO. BURNOUTS LEAD TO THE REBIRTHS.&nbsp; WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE NOT DESIGNING?&nbsp; A BITTER ALCOHOLIC PAINTER.&nbsp; CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE LIFE-SIZE STATUE OF YOURSELF IN THE PARIS STORE? WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?&nbsp; I COMMISSIONED IT AS A PORTRAIT WHEN I BOUGHT MY HOUSE. TRADITIONALLY, WHEN A MAN REACHES A CERTAIN AGE AND SECURITY, HE IMMORTALIZES HIMSELF AT HIS PEAK. THE IMPLICATION OF COURSE IS THAT FROM THERE, IT&#39;S DOWNHILL TILL DEATH. I LIKED THE IDEA AS A SILLY EXERCISE IN VANITY AND MORTALITY. AND SENTIMENTALITY. IT WAS MY VERSION OF MY PORTRAIT OVER MY FIREPLACE. PITTI IMAGINE INVITED ME TO DO AN INSTALLATION IN FLORENCE, AND IT SEEMED AMUSING TO SHOW IT THERE, ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY ITS INTENT HAD ONLY BEEN FOR MY HOUSE. AFTERWARDS, IT SEEMED TO SUIT THE PALAIS ROYAL LOCATION, SO I JUST KEPT IT THERE.&nbsp; ARE ALL DESIGNERS CONTROL FREAKS? DO YOU FIND IT EASY TO DELEGATE?&nbsp; I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DELEGATE. I&#39;M A TOTAL CUNT, AND I&#39;M ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE AS I GET OLDER.&nbsp; YOU HAVE RECENTLY OPENED STORES IN NEW YORK AND LONDON. WHAT WAS THE CONCEPT BEHIND THEM?&nbsp; THE PARIS STORE IS COZY, INSULATED AND HIDDEN IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN. CONTAINING OF COURSE MY &quot;CORPSE.&quot; THE NYC STORE IS IN A BLEAK AREA NORTH OF TRIBECA WITH A LOT OF SPACE. I INSTALLED A FOG MACHINE WALL TO &quot;CAPTURE&quot; AN ELEMENT OF DREAMY DRAMA IN THE SPACE. THE LONDON STORE IS VERY CLASSICAL AND WILL HAVE A WAX HEAD ON A PLATE IN HOMAGE TO MR. WILDE&#39;S FAMOUS PLAY &quot;SALOME.&quot;&nbsp; DO YOU STILL GET NERVOUS BEFORE SHOWS, OR ARE YOU FAIRLY CONFIDENT IN YOUR VISION?&nbsp; I USUALLY SAY NO, BECAUSE AT THE SHOW I FEEL PRETTY CALM AND HAVE A GOOD TIME, BUT I REALIZE THAT I DO WAKE UP AND CHAIN SMOKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FOR THE 2 WEEKS BEFORE. I&#39;M MORE NERVOUS ABOUT THE TIME THAN THE RESPONSE, THOUGH.&nbsp; WHERE ARE YOU ACTUALLY BASED? DO YOU HAVE HOMES IN SEVERAL CITIES?&nbsp; NO, I JUST HAVE A HOUSE IN PARIS. I THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING A PLACE IN ITALY, BUT DECIDED I PREFER HOTELS.&nbsp; JOURNALISTS OFTEN REFER TO AN &ldquo;AMERICAN SENSIBILITY&rdquo; IN FASHION, COMBINING SPORTSWEAR, CLEAN LINES AND COMFORT. DO YOU RELATE TO ANY OF THAT?&nbsp; TOTALLY.&nbsp; WHICH CITIES INSPIRE YOU? AND WHY?&nbsp; I GO TO VENICE A LOT&mdash;IT WAS BETWEEN SETTLING DOWN IN VENICE OR PARIS. I LOVE GOING THROUGH THE TRAIN STATION IN MILAN. I LOVE THE SUN IN TANGIER. I LIKE THE GREYNESS OF BERLIN. BUT I ALWAYS FEEL I&#39;M IN THE RIGHT PLACE AS I&#39;M CROSSING THE BRIDGE FROM THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE TO MY HOUSE ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE AIRPORT.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;VE PUT MEN IN STACKED HEELS, AND YOUR WOMEN&rsquo;S CLOTHES ARE OFTEN ANDROGYNOUS. IS GENDER STILL RELEVANT IN FASHION?&nbsp; WE&#39;RE IN A PRETTY CONSERVATIVE ERA. I DON&#39;T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD, BUT IN MY WORLD THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A DARK CORNER FOR SEXUAL AMBIGUITY.

THEY ARE PREMONITIONS OF THE MELTDOWN OF LIFE AND CULTURE THAT IS RIGHT AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. THEY ARE TROLL CLOTHES FOR THE MOST DESPERATE LEMMINGS IN THE FASHION HERD. IT&rsquo;S ALWAYS SO INTERESTING TO ME THAT WHEN SOMETHING TRULY QUESTIONABLE IN VISION AND EXECUTION COMES DOWN THE PIKE, THE FIRST THING THE PRESS SAYS IS WHAT BRILLIANT TAILORING IT POSSESSES. WELL IT DOESN&rsquo;T. SAVILLE ROW OR LOWER ORCHARD STREET HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE STARVING WILL EAT ANYTHING NOT MOVING TOO FAST, WHETHER ITS ANIMAL, MINERAL OR VEGETABLE. A LINE NEEDS TO BE DRAWN WHEREBY CREDIT IS GIVEN TO COLLECTIONS THAT DESERVE THEM. TOO MUCH TALK IS SPENT ON TOO LITTLE.

SHOPTALK ENSUED AS DID CHANEL BISQUE FOUNDATION, TINA TURNER&#39;S &ldquo;ACID QUEEN,&rdquo; AND A &ldquo;MOMENT&rdquo; WHEN LISTENING TO SISTERS OF MERCY.&nbsp; A CALIFORNIAN LIVING IN PARIS SINCE 2003, RICK OWENS WAS WORRIED ABOUT LOSING TRACK OF HIS ROOTS. &ldquo;I WAS SO CONSCIOUS OF GETTING A FAKE EURO ACCENT, I STARTED EXAGGERATING MY CALIFORNIA ACCENT,&rdquo; HE LAUGHS, &ldquo;SO NOW I&#39;M A CARTOON.&rdquo; IF THAT IS THE CASE, WE&rsquo;RE NOT TALKING DISNEY. OWENS&rsquo; SENSIBILITY IS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF TIM BURTON&rsquo;S &quot;NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS,&quot; OR EMILY THE STRANGE. IN SHORT, HE COULDN&rsquo;T BE FURTHER FROM HIS FELLOW CALIFORNIAN JEREMY SCOTT IF HE TRIED. OWENS&rsquo; VISION, AS HE HIMSELF ADMITS, IS TIED UP WITH THE MACABRE, THE DARK, THE SHADOWY AND, OF COURSE, THE GOTH. WITH HIS SPRING/SUMMER COLLECTION, ENTITLED &ldquo;DUST,&rdquo; HE USES &ldquo;MINIMALIST GOTH&rdquo; AS BUZZWORDS FOR PALE GIRLS DRESSED IN LUXE BLACK LEATHER BASQUES, ARTFULLY FLARED COATS AND BOOTS COVERED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE SHINY BLACK BIN BAGS. THIS, AGAIN, LEADS BACK TO OWENS&rsquo; ROOTS. &ldquo;AS A TEENAGER, I HAD HAIR SPIKES HELD UP WITH EGGWHITES, A ROSARY FROM NOSE TO EAR, AND CHANEL&#39;S BISQUE FOUNDATION AND POWDER,&rdquo; HE REMEMBERS. &ldquo;EVERYTHING ELSE WAS BLACK, OF COURSE.&rdquo; OF COURSE. ON THE VERGE OF LAUNCHING HIS THIRD STORE &ndash; THIS TIME IN LONDON &ndash; CALIFORNIA&rsquo;S FAVOURITE GOTH LET US INTO HIS LAIR.&nbsp; YOU MENTION &ldquo;MINIMALIST GOTH&rdquo; FOR THE DUST COLLECTION. WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT GOTHIC STYLE?&nbsp; RIGHT NOW, MY FAVORITE GOTH MOMENT IS TINA TURNER SINGING &quot;ACID QUEEN&quot; IN &quot;TOMMY.&quot; YOUTUBE IT. THERE&#39;S SEX, DEATH, CAPES, PLATFORM BOOTS AND DRUGS. IT&rsquo;S EXAGGERATED, SENSATIONAL AND SILLY. MY FAVOURITE THINGS.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE INSPIRATIONS THAT YOU COME BACK TO ALL THE TIME?&nbsp; IT&#39;S ALWAYS BACK TO BAUHAUS &ndash; THE DESIGN SCHOOL AND THE BAND. OPERA, TOUJOURS OPERA. OH, AND KISS. RECENTLY, AUTUMN/WINTER WAS INSPIRED BY JOYFUL AND PLAYFUL TRANSGRESSION. SPRING WAS MORE ABOUT RESTRAINT, DISCIPLINE AND SACRIFICE.&nbsp; BOTH COLLECTIONS SEEM TO SHOW A NEWLY SLICK RICK.&nbsp; I FEEL LIKE I&#39;VE FINALLY LEARNED TO DRIVE MY MACHINE. WHEN YOU FIRST LEARN STICK SHIFT, YOU AWKWARDLY LURCH AND STALL, BUT GRADUALLY YOU LEARN TO SHIFT THE GEARS MORE SMOOTHLY. I KNEW HOW TO MAKE CLOTHES BUT HAD A LOT TO LEARN IN PRESENTATION. AND I HAD A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN A LOT OF LANGUAGES I DIDN&#39;T KNOW, ACCORDING TO A LOT OF SCHEDULES THAT I HAD TO LEARN FOR THE FIRST TIME. I&#39;D BEEN DOING IT FREESTYLE ON MY OWN FOR SO LONG.&nbsp; YOU DESIGN FURNITURE, DENIM AND JERSEY ALONG WITH THE MAIN LINE. IS IT DIFFICULT SWITCHING FROM EACH OF THEM?&nbsp; NOT REALLY. IT&#39;S ALL PART OF THE SAME STORY. FURNITURE IS THE NEXT NATURAL HUMAN ENVELOPE AFTER CLOTHES, AND BUILDING IS THE NEXT AFTER THAT. I&#39;M TALKING WITH SOME FRIENDS ABOUT A HOTEL. WOULDN&#39;T THAT BE A COOL THING TO DO?&nbsp; IT WOULD INDEED. A NEW STORE IN LONDON IS FIRST, THOUGH. WHY THE UK?&nbsp; THE PARIS STORE WAS A FLUKE BECAUSE THAT SPACE BECAME AVAILABLE AND THE PALAIS ROYAL WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS IN PARIS. I DIDN&#39;T REALLY EXPECT IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT IT SURPRISED US. SO WE BECAME OPEN TO THE IDEA OF OPENING STORES. AN OPPORTUNITY CAME UP IN NEW YORK; WE OPENED THAT LAST JULY AND THE RESULTS COULDN&#39;T BE BETTER. I DON&#39;T REALLY KNOW ABOUT LONDON, THOUGH. THEY SEEM PRETTY FANCY. I MIGHT NOT BE THEIR CUP OF TEA. WE&#39;LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;RE CERTAINLY WELL THOUGHT-OF IN LONDON, ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR SUPPORT OF GARETH PUGH. HOW DID YOU DISCOVER HIS WORK?&nbsp; HE INTERNED FOR ME AT REVILLON [THE FUR HOUSE WHERE OWENS WAS CREATIVE DIRECTOR UNTIL 2006] FOR HALF A MINUTE, BUT IT WAS MICHELE [LAMY, OWENS&rsquo; WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER] WHO NURTURED HIM. SHE&#39;S THE LOVING, OVERINDULGENT MOTHER AND I&#39;M THE DISTANT, CRITICAL FATHER. MY FAITH IN GARETH STEMS FROM IDENTIFYING WITH HIM. HE&#39;D BE MAKING CLOTHES IF WE WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM OR NOT. HE HAS A FEROCIOUS FOCUS.&nbsp; WERE YOU PROUD TO SEE HIS FIRST SHOW IN PARIS?&nbsp; IT WAS ACTUALLY THE THIRD SHOW I&#39;D EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE. THE FIRST WAS GAULTIER MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO, AND THE SECOND WAS RAF SIMONS TWO YEARS AGO. I WAS PROUD TO BE GARETH&#39;S FRIEND.&nbsp; WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHEN WAS YOUR OWN PROUDEST MOMENT?&nbsp; I WAS LISTENING TO THE SISTERS OF MERCY AS I WAS WALKING HOME ACROSS THE BRIDGE FROM PLACE DE LA CONCORDE ONE DAY AND FELT A SURGE OF EMOTION. IT WAS UNDER SUCH DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THAN THOSE IN WHICH I&#39;D LISTENED TO THEM IN MY YOUTH.&nbsp; WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO MOVE FROM CALIFORNIA TO PARIS?&nbsp; PURELY PRACTICAL. I WAS MANUFACTURING IN ITALY AND IT WASN&#39;T GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT IF I WASN&#39;T THERE A LOT. I WAS ALSO STARTING TO SHOW IN PARIS SO IT SEEMED THAT EUROPE WAS THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS HAPPENING FOR ME.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU MISS ABOUT THE US?&nbsp; BLUNTNESS.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT PARIS?&nbsp; ITS ALOOF BEAUTY.&nbsp; WHICH OTHER DESIGNER DO YOU ADMIRE?&nbsp; LONG LIST.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE FASHION ERA?&nbsp; THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES.&nbsp; WHAT MADE YOU DROP ART SCHOOL AND BECOME A DESIGNER?&nbsp; FEAR. ART WAS THE PRIESTHOOD AND FASHION WAS DISCO DANCING.&nbsp; WERE YOU ALWAYS INTO CLOTHES?&nbsp; I WAS A LATE BLOOMER. LOOKING BACK, I WISH I&#39;D GONE FURTHER.&nbsp; YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY VOGUE AND THE CDFA FOR YOUR FIRST SHOWS. DO YOU WANT TO SUPPORT GARETH PUGH IN A SIMILAR WAY?&nbsp; I DON&#39;T HAVE THAT POWER. VOGUE&#39;S INITIAL ENDORSEMENT VALIDATED ME TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. MY SUPPORT FOR GARETH CAN ONLY HELP HIM MANUFACTURE HIS CLOTHES. THE REST IS UP TO HIM. AND HE&#39;S DOING JUST FINE.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE RICK OWENS SIGNATURES?&nbsp; I KNOW THAT I ALWAYS WANT TO GET TO A CERTAIN ELEGANCE BUT I WANT TO SHOW THE ROUGH SPOTS IT TOOK TO GET THERE.

AND I WAS ATTRACTED TO THE HIGHER SPIRITUAL PLANE DRAMA QUEEN ELEMENT OF IT.&nbsp; TALKING ABOUT THE BIBLE, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BIBLICAL STORY ABOUT ADAM AND THE DEMONESS LILITH? ADAM MADE FROM PURE DUST AND LILITH FROM FILTH AND SEDIMENT.&nbsp; MICHELE LAMY: ADAM AND EVE WERE BOTH FROM PURE DUST. LILITH CAME LATER TO REINFORCE DREAMS AND POWER OF MESOPOTAMIAN MEN. TWIST ON THEIR FASCINATION OF THE WOMEN BODY AND THE MYSTERY OF PROCREATION.&nbsp; R.O.: I DON&rsquo;T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT LILITH BUT I ASSUME SHE WAS AN INVENTION OF MEN UPTIGHT ABOUT THE IDEA OF A SEXUAL WOMAN.&nbsp; WHAT WERE YOUR TEENAGE DESIRES, AND HOW DID YOU BOTH DRESS WHEN YOU WERE TEENS? RICK, I READ THAT YOU WERE EXTREMELY SHY. I CANNOT IMAGINE YOU SUFFERED FROM THAT, MICHELE?&nbsp; M.L.: COMING FROM BEING FROM 9 YEARS OLD TO 17 IN AN EVERYDAY NAVY UNIFORM IN BOARDING SCHOOL. AFTER THAT, COURCHEVEL, SAINT TROPEZ, FURS, FLEA MARKETS, CRAZY HAIR, HENNA BRACELETS, DOROTHEE BIS, SONIA RYKIEL, KENZO IN THEIR FIRST YEARS. MAI 68 HUGE IMPACT, LABORDE [CLINIC] DELEUZE AND GUATTARI...DRUGS. SO, NOT SHY.&nbsp; R.O.: I THINK MICHELE CAUGHT ON TO SOCIAL SKILLS PRETTY EARLY ON AND PROBABLY DRESSED IN A CELEBRATORY WAY WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO. I WAS KIND OF MISERABLE AND DRESSED OUT OF ANGER AND DEFIANCE. OF COURSE I WASN&rsquo;T FOOLING ANYBODY.&nbsp; HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU DISCOVERED FRENCH VOGUE AND THE MUGLER AND MONTANA &#39;80S MOMENT?&nbsp; R.O.: PROBABLY AROUND 17. I WAS IMPRESSED THAT SOMEONE COULD CREATE A GLAMOROUS MYTHOLOGICAL WORLD WITH PERFECT HEROIC BEAUTIES. I ALSO HAD LED ZEPPELIN, AND JOHN WATERS, ALL CREATING THEIR OWN PARALLEL UNIVERSES.&nbsp; ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE CANADIAN DIRECTOR GUY MADDIN? HIS FILMS ARE KNOWN FOR THE LOOK OF MODERN DECAY, OR RATHER DECAY THAT IS MADE IN A MODERN WAY. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON DECAY AND ITS OWN INTEGRITY? YOU LIKE YOUR FABRICS TO FEEL SOFT AND LOOK USED, IS THERE ANY PARALLEL WITH MADDIN&rsquo;S APPROACH TO FILM?&nbsp; M.L.: NOT AT ALL. I THINK I ONLY SAW &quot;MY WINNIPEG.&quot; DID NOT CLICK. WENT FROM GODARD 3 TIMES A DAY TO ANDY WARHOL/PAUL MORRISSEY NON-STOP.&nbsp; R.O.: IF THERE&rsquo;S A FILMMAKING ASSOCIATION FOR ME, IT WOULD BE WITH SATYAJIT RAY&rsquo;S FILMS. DUSTY ROBES AND RESTRAINED EMOTIONS. I WAS ALWAYS DISSATISFIED THAT ANYTHING EXTREME OR RADICAL IN FASHION HAD TO BE RESERVED FOR SUNDAY BEST OR RUNWAY. FROM THE BEGINNING, I DECIDED TO CORRUPT FROM WITHIN. IF AN EXTREME SILHOUETTE WAS SOFT, GREY AND WEATHERED, IT SLIPPED INTO EVERYDAY LIFE WITHOUT MAKING A BIG NOISE.&nbsp; DID EITHER OF YOU EVER WATCH THE GOTHIC SOAP OPERA FROM THE LATE &#39;60S, EARLY &#39;70S, &ldquo;DARK SHADOWS&rdquo;? IF SO, DID IT LEAVE ANY IMPRESSION ON YOU?&nbsp; M.L.: NO.&nbsp; R.O.: I DIDN&rsquo;T HAVE A TV BUT MY BEST FRIEND NANCY THE LESBIAN THREATENED TO GET AN &quot; I LOVE BARNABAS &quot; TATTOO.&nbsp; HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE THE DARK, THE MACABRE AND THE SHADOWY&mdash;AND WHAT PART DOES THAT PLAY IN YOUR DESIGNS?&nbsp; M.L.: I DON&#39;T SEE RICK DESIGN AS MACABRE AT ALL. SHADOWY AND DARK IN AN HAPPY WAY. THE HAIR SHINE. THE SKIN GLOW. BLUE IS FOR THE SKY AND THE EYES. AND A LITTLE RED FOR BERRIES AND MOUTH SOMETIMES. HE IS SHADOWY AND ELEGANT.&nbsp; R.O.: YEAH. THAT&rsquo;S JUST WHAT I WANT TO BE. SHADOWY AND ELEGANT. AND WHO CAN RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF THE SUPERNATURAL? MY WORLD IS AN INCLUSIVE ONE WHERE UNCONVENTIONAL BEAUTY IS CELEBRATED. AND ANY TIME YOU GO AGAINST THE GRAIN IN A SOMBER WAY IT INEVITABLY TAKES ON A SINISTER TONE.&nbsp; IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAD AN IGGY POP MOMENT IN A TACKY MEXICAN DRAG BAR IN L.A.? DID YOU EVER MEET HIM AGAIN?&nbsp; R.O.: YEP. NOPE.&nbsp; I KNOW RICK STARTED OUT IN PORTERVILLE, AN AGRICULTURAL TOWN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU GREW UP NEAR THE ALPS? WHERE EXACTLY AND WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO MOVE TO L.A.?&nbsp; M.L.: ON A WHIM. FROM EARLY 20S ALWAYS DREAMT OF A LITTLE SCRIPT AND TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. A LOT OF DIFFERENT STORIES THAT TOOK ME HERE AND THERE BUT ALWAYS ATTRACTED BY THE STATES. A LOT OF COMING AND GOING TO NEW YORK FIRST. THEN DECIDED TO LIVE IN L.A. WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN THERE. NEVER WENT TO A SHRINK EITHER.&nbsp; IN 1988 YOU WERE WORKING AS A PATTERN CUTTER FOR MICHELE. IS THAT HOW YOU MET? YOU DID THAT FOR TWO YEARS. WHEN DID THE ROMANCE BEGIN?&nbsp; M.L.: TOTAL STRIKE OF THUNDER. DID NOT HAVE EVEN A &quot;REGULAR CONVERSATION&quot; FOR TWO YEARS BUT WE WERE EVERY DAY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. THINK SOMETHING HAPPEN AT A STARN TWINS EXHIBITION AT MOCA. THEN A LONG KISSING DRINKING COURTSHIP.&nbsp; WAS IT SIX YEARS LATER THAT YOU OPENED YOUR OWN BRAND. DID MICHELE ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT?&nbsp; R.O.: SHE DIDN&rsquo;T NEED TO. IT WAS AN UNDERSTOOD PART OF OUR LIVES.&nbsp; HOW DID YOU SWITCH FROM YOUR OWN BRAND TO OPENING LES DEUX CAFES?&nbsp; M.L.: DID NOT SWITCH BUT OVERLAP. OPEN FIRST CAFE DES ARTISTES WITH A FRENCH GIRLFRIEND WHO HAD COME TO LIVE WITH ME AFTER LOSING HER LEASE AT L&#39;ENTREPOT IN PARIS. SEE, EVEN IF I MOVED AROUND A LOT ALWAYS TOOK WITH ME MY TWO SIDES OF THE FAMILY: THE FASHION MANUFACTURING ON MY FATHER SIDE AND THE RESTAURANT/CLUB FROM MY MOTHER SIDE.&nbsp; WAS THE REASON YOU SOLD LES DEUX CAFES BECAUSE OF THE MOVE TO PARIS AND REVILLON?&nbsp; M.L.: SEE MARLENE DIETRICH IN CASABLANCA FOLLOWING GARY COOPER.&nbsp; R.O.: IN THE TWO YEARS OF WORKING FOR MICHELE PRIOR TO OUR GETTING TOGETHER, I HAD A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING HER ACCENT AND WINDING THOUGHT PROCESS. I JUST KNEW THAT IT WAS WILDLY ATTRACTIVE. WHEN I STARTED TO UNDERSTAND HER, THE ATTRACTION WAS COMPLETE. SOON AFTER US GETTING TOGETHER, MICHELE LOST INTEREST WITH THE RAG BUSINESS AND IMMERSED HERSELF IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS. AT THAT MOMENT, CAFE DES ARTISTES WAS A TINY CAFE HIDDEN BEHIND BUSHES ON A SLEAZY SIDE STREET BETWEEN SUNSET AND HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARDS WITH COMPETING DRUG DEALERS ON EACH END. LEAVE IT TO MICHELE TO TURN THIS MOST INCREDIBLY UNLIKELY SPOT INTO THE COOLEST GROWN-UP CROSSROADS OF ALL WORLDS. ONE OF THE NIGHTS THAT MIGHT SUM IT UP WAS LIZA MINNELLI DESCRIBING TO ME HOW ELSA PERETTI GAVE HER FAKE DIAMONDS AND THEN JUMPING UP TO RUN AFTER MADONNA WHO WAS JUST LEAVING AND BUMPING INTO JONI MITCHELL ON THE WAY IN. AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS STARTING TO MAKE CLOTHES AND SELL THEM TO CHARLES GALLAY, A LEGENDARY RETAILER IN L.A. HE PREPAID AND KEPT ME AFLOAT. MICHELE AND I DIDN&rsquo;T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY JUST THEN. BUT I REMEMBER NOT NOTICING TOO MUCH. WE JUST FLOATED THROUGH. AT ONE POINT WE WERE ROBBED AT GUNPOINT IN OUR BED IN OUR APARTMENT AND IMMEDIATELY MOVED TO THE CHATEAU MARMONT. WE HAD ONE OF THE LAST CHEAP ROOMS IN THE WING THAT WASN&rsquo;T REFURBISHED YET. I MADE MY FIRST COLLECTION THERE AND MICHELE SAILED TO THE CAFE EVERY NIGHT IN SOMETHING FROM IT. LOOKING BACK, BEING BROKE DIDN&rsquo;T SEEM TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM. I THINK WE JUST ASSUMED IT WAS TEMPORARY.&nbsp; IS IT TRUE, RICK, THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH A DRUG/ALCOHOL MOMENT AND THAT IT WAS MICHELE THAT GOT YOU OUT OF IT? HOW BAD DID IT GET BEFORE YOU TOOK THE HIGH ROAD TO HEALTH?&nbsp; M.L.: OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS PRETTY BOOZY AS WE NEEDED HELP TO DISENTANGLE OUR DIFFERENT STRINGS. WHEN IT GOT TOO NASTY FOR HIM I WAS ALWAYS THERE AND DRAGGING HIM TO THE GYM. WHEN HE GOT OUT OF IT I SERIOUSLY FELL APART, TOO, AND HE PICKED ME UP.&nbsp; R.O.: WELL, MICHELE JUST ENDED UP TIPSY AT THE END OF THE NIGHT. I ENDED UP WAKING UP UNDER FREEWAY OVERPASSES. IT TOOK ME A COUPLE OF CLOSE CALLS TO SCARE ME STRAIGHT. WE&rsquo;RE NOT AA OR ANYTHING, IT JUST FEELS TOO GOOD NOW TO NOT DRINK.&nbsp; WAS YOUR FIRST COLLECTION IN 1996? WAS MICHELE YOUR MUSE FROM YOUR FIRST COLLECTION? HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE A MUSE AND WHAT IS THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?&nbsp; M.L.: DON&#39;T KNOW ABOUT MUSE. IS IT SOMETHING TO SAY JUST WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY? CERTAINLY I BROUGHT A EASY JE NE SAIS QUOI AND COULD NOT WEAR ANYTHING ELSE.&nbsp; R.O.: MUSE ALWAYS SOUNDS TOO FAG-HAGGY TO ME. SHE HOLDS UP STANDARDS THAT RESONATE WITH ME. AESTHETICALLY, MORALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. I ALWAYS INTRODUCE HER AS MY BETTER HALF BECAUSE THAT&rsquo;S MY MOST ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF HER.&nbsp; WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE POPULARITY OF DESIGNING WITH A MUSE IN MIND HAS FADED SINCE THE &#39;80S FOR MANY OTHER DESIGNERS NOWADAYS?&nbsp; M.L.: BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET. NOTHING CHANGE. THERE IS MORE INFORMATION. MORE PEOPLE.&nbsp; R.O.: ACTUALLY, I&rsquo;M TRYING TO THINK OF AN EXAMPLE OF A DESIGNER AND MUSE AND I CAN&rsquo;T THINK OF ANY. DENEUVE AND ST. LAURENT? HEPBURN AND GIVENCHY? I ALWAYS THOUGHT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WERE PROBABLY HYPED AND NOT A TRUE EXAMPLE. OH, PEGGY MOFFITT AND GERNREICH. THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SINCERE COLLABORATION.&nbsp; CAN THE MUSE BE REVIVED AS A MODERN DAY &ldquo;TARGET MARKET&rdquo; PROFILE? OR SHOULD THE MUSE REMAIN A PRIVATE AFFAIR IN THE ATELIER?&nbsp; M.L.: PRIVATE AFFAIR IN THE ATELIER.&nbsp; R.O.: I GUESS EVERYBODY DOES IT THEIR OWN WAY. I&rsquo;M SURE THERE ARE DESIGNERS THAT HAVE TARGET MARKET MUSES AND IT WORKS OUT GREAT FOR THEM. THINGS SEEM TO WORK BEST FOR ME WHEN I DON&rsquo;T TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TOO MUCH AND JUST GO WITH MY GUT.&nbsp; IS IT BETTER TO HAVE A PASSIVE MUSE OR ONE WITH IDEAS, INTELLECT?&nbsp; M.L.: BOTH.&nbsp; R.O.: I DON&rsquo;T THINK IT WOULD BE VERY REALISTIC OR SATISFYING TO HAVE A PASSIVE MUSE.&nbsp; THIS SPRING 2009 THERE WILL BE AN EXHIBITION ORGANIZED BY THE COSTUME INSTITUTE OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART &ldquo;THE MODEL AS MUSE: EMBODYING FASHION.&rdquo; CAN YOU BOTH REFER TO OTHER MUSES IN HISTORY?&nbsp; M.L.: FASHION MUSES ARE THE LEAST OF THE MUSES...OFTEN CALLED CLIENTS. IN HISTORY THE GREAT MUSES ARE RELATED TO ARTISTS. LET&#39;S JUST SAY KIKI DE MONTPARNASSE, ALMA MAHLER, GEORGES SAND AND DORA MAAR. THEY SAY BEHIND A GREAT MAN THERE IS ALWAYS...&nbsp; R.O.: DUSE AND D&rsquo;ANNUNZIO? DIVINE AND JOHN WATERS?&nbsp; WHAT WAS YOUR IDEAL FOR BEAUTY WHEN YOU FIRST GOT INTERESTED IN FASHION, AND HOW HAS THAT EVOLVED?&nbsp; M.L.: NEFERTITI. NEVER CHANGE NEVER WILL.&nbsp; R.O.: WELL, PROBABLY THE COVER OF DIAMOND DOGS. THE MEMORY OF THAT MIX OF THE GROTESQUE, THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE AMBIGUOUS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING I HAVE IN COMMON WITH ALL MY CLIENTS. AND I&rsquo;M PROBABLY ALWAYS DOING SOME KIND OF VARIATION OF IT.&nbsp; WHO IS YOUR MALE MUSE? IS IT YOURSELF?&nbsp; R.O.: YOU&rsquo;D THINK SO, WOULDN&rsquo;T YOU? BUT THE GUY I&rsquo;VE BEEN REGULARLY PHOTOGRAPHING IN MY CLOTHES MIGHT BE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF ME: BONY, WHITE, KIND OF LIKE A GREYHOUND. I SUPPOSE I OBJECTIFY HIM LIKE A PORCELAIN TRANSLUCENT JELLYFISH. GRACEFUL AND ALIEN. I&rsquo;M ALWAYS CRITICAL OF DESIGNERS WHO DRESS WOMEN LIKE UNF CKABLE DOLLS, BUT MAYBE THAT&rsquo;S WHAT I DO WITH MEN. BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO MAKING, AS OPPOSED TO PHOTOGRAPHING CLOTHES, MY CRITERIA ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. I CREATED AN IDEAL MIX OF HELMUT BERGER AND NEIL YOUNG IN MY HEAD. HELMUT BERGER FOR THE SEXUALLY FLEXIBLE, EURO-WICKED GLAMOROUS SIDE, AND NEIL YOUNG FOR THE SILENT-INTEGRITY GUY SIDE. SO YES, I SUPPOSE THAT&rsquo;S THE MIX I&rsquo;D LIKE TO BE.&nbsp; I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR DARK STYLE IS SO APPRECIATED RIGHT NOW?&nbsp; M.L.: IT SEEMS THAT THE HUN IS MAKING HIS MARK RIGHT NOW. IT&#39;S JUST FAIR. HE IS EVEN GETTING BETTER WITH A NICE BUSINESS TEAM, AND HERE YOU ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT YOUR DARK, LET&#39;S SAY&mdash;THAT THE ELEGANCE AND THE EASYNESS AND SPECIALLY THAT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT&mdash;IT&#39;S THAT YOU GET A DIFFERENT WAY OF WALKING AND BEHAVING IN HIS CLOTHES THAT IT&#39;S DIFFICULT TO CHANGE.&nbsp; R.O.: WELL, I&rsquo;M PRETTY LUCKY. ANY APPRECIATION FOR ME HAS A LOT TO DO WITH GOOD SALES AND MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. I THINK I&rsquo;VE LEARNED HOW TO MAKE A MORE CONVINCING AND FOCUSED PRESENTATION RECENTLY, THOUGH, AND I DO FEEL A RESPONSE.&nbsp; HOW DOES ONE MAINTAIN A CULT FOLLOWING PURSUING AN ANTI-FASHION ETHIC BUT SELLING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF CLOTHES EACH YEAR?&nbsp; M.L.: NO ADVERTISING.&nbsp; R.O.: YEAH, COULD BE THAT SIMPLE. I WAS NEVER A BIG SENSATION, SO I HAD A WHILE TO JUST BE THERE. AND NOW I&rsquo;M JUST THERE. TOO OLD TO BE NEW, AND TOO AROUND TO IGNORE, I SUPPOSE.&nbsp; WHAT WAS THE REACTION OF FONDAZIONE PITTI DISCOVERY, WHEN YOU PROPOSED THE MADAME TUSSAUD SCULPTURE OF YOURSELF PEEING? DID YOU HAVE A GOOD LAUGH WHEN YOU PULLED THAT ONE OFF?&nbsp; R.O.: THEY DIDN&rsquo;T BAT AN EYELASH. THEY WERE INCREDIBLY GENEROUS WITH ME, CREATING THREE SEPARATE SIMULTANEOUS INSTALLATIONS AND PRODUCING A MENS RUNWAY SHOW. THEY WERE VERY RESPECTFUL BUT I SUSPECT THEY ENJOYED A CHEERFULLY TRANSGRESSIVE GESTURE AS MUCH AS I DID. BY THE WAY, THAT SCULPTURE WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE EXHIBITED. I JUST WANTED A PAINTING-OVER-THE-MANTELPIECE EXPERIENCE AND COMMISIONED IT FOR MY HOUSE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A FUNNY EXERCISE IN VANITY, MORTALITY AND INTERIOR DECORATION. BUT WHEN PITTI INVITED ME TO DO SOMETHING, IT JUST HAPPENED TO COME IN HANDY.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE STORY THAT YOU WERE TELLING WITH YOU &ldquo;PRIESTESSES OF LONGING&rdquo; COLLECTION?&nbsp; R.O.: I WAS ASKING MYSELF &ldquo;WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY WITH WHAT I&rsquo;M DOING?&rdquo; AND BEING ALL EXISTENTIAL. I ACTUALLY WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THE WORD &ldquo;LONGING.&rdquo; I&rsquo;M NOT SAYING THIS IS THE ANSWER, BUT IT DID SEEM LIKE A CLUE. EVERYTHING I WAS ATTRACTED TO THAT SEEMED WORTHY OF ATTRACTION HAD A SENSE OF LONGING ATTACHED. EVERY OPERA HAD A LONGING FOR A LOVE SO TRUE, THAT, ONCE ATTAINED, THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT DIE. THE SAME WITH HEAVY METAL ANTHEMS. THE SAME WITH DRUG HIGHS&mdash;LONGING FOR THAT ECSTATIC MOMENT. LONGING FOR VALIDATION. LONGING TO BE A RELEVANT DESIGNER. OR LONGING FOR A MOMENT OF SPIRITUALITY SO PURE, YOU DON&rsquo;T WANNA COME BACK. AND I WAS THINKING OF THE DISCIPLINE AND FAITH AND GRIM DETERMINATION IT SOMETIMES TAKES TO GET WHAT YOU LONG FOR. YOU BOTH LOVE FUR, AND YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE HUNS. IS THE FUR A GLAMOROUS TAKE ON THE NOMADS?&nbsp; M.L.: YES YES MILLE FOIS YES. TRIBES.&nbsp; R.O.: PROBABLY. THERE&rsquo;S AN APPEALING REDUCTIVENESS TO IT. A SKIN, A ROCK AND A FIRE.&nbsp; LET&rsquo;S TALK ABOUT THE FURNITURE. WHEN YOU STARTED WITH IT YOU CALLED IT AN EXPENSIVE HOBBY. DO YOU STILL SEE IT THAT WAY? LAST NIGHT YOU SAID THAT THE IMPETUS BEHIND THE FURNITURE WAS THAT YOU HAD THIS BIG SPACE AND YOU NEEDED TO ADAPT IT TO YOUR LIFE STYLE. I THINK NEED IS THE BEST REASON EVER TO START SOMETHING; YOU NEED IT AND FOR SURE SOMEONE ELSE WILL NEED IT TO.&nbsp; M.L.: IN THE HUN&#39;S WORLD YOU CANNOT BUY ANYTHING. YOU CAN LOVE APPRECIATE A LOT OF ARTISTS BUT THEIR OBJECTS, FURNITURE, ET CETERA WON&#39;T EVER FIT. I HAVE ALWAYS THIS DREAM THAT I WILL REDOCORATE. AT LEAST A CORNER. NEVER WORKS. SO IN MY CORNER LAMYLAND I PILED IT UP WITH BONZAI AND STUFFED MONKEYS AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH. FURNITURE IS GREAT. SO HAPPY THAT JOUSSE PICKED IT UP. A GREAT STORY.&nbsp; R.O.: I THINK OF IT AS CUSTOMIZING. IF EVERYONE COULD CUSTOMIZE THE STUFF THEY USE EVERY DAY, THEY WOULD. I CAN. OR, IT MIGHT JUST BE MY EGO RUNNING RAMPANT, HAVING TO PISS ON EVERY TREE TRUNK AROUND ME. EITHER WAY, IT&rsquo;S DEVELOPED A NICE LIFE OF ITS OWN THAT&rsquo;S CULTIVATED AND DEVELOPED BY MICHELE. I JUST WANTED TO HAVE SURROUNDINGS DESIGNED BY MORETTI, LE CORBUSIER AND RUHLMANN. SO I FAKED IT.&nbsp; THE ARCHITECT OF YOUR LONDON SHOP WAS YOUR FIRST CLIENT. TELL ME HOW THAT ALL HAPPENED. YOU KNEW HIS WORK BEFORE HE KNEW YOURS, BUT HE CONTACTED YOU. WHAT KIND OF FURS AND MATERIALS DO YOU USE&mdash;PLYWOOD, STEEL, CONCRETE?&nbsp; M.L.: YOU ARE TALKING OF JOSEPH DIRAND. JOSEPH IS ALWAYS DOING THE JOUSSE GALLERY BOOTH FOR ALL THEIR ART FAIRS. WHEN RICK HAD HIS OPENING AT THE GALLERY LAST OCTOBER, JOSEPH WAS IN MEXICO FINISHING THIS HOTEL HE DESIGNED THERE. HE GOT A PRIZE FOR BEST HOTEL CONCEPT FOR THIS. ANYWAY, HE WAS IN MEXICO AND GOT A MAIL OF THE INVITATION CARD OF THE GALLERY. THERE WAS A HALF PICTURE OF ONE OF THE ANTLER CHAIR ON IT. HE LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT HE CALLED TO GET ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PIECES AND BOUGHT FOR THE LOBBY OF THE HOTEL THREE &quot;CURIAL&quot; CHAIRS AND MORE.&nbsp; LET&rsquo;S TALK ABOUT THE DESIGN OF YOUR NEW SHOPS NYC AND LONDON.&nbsp; R.O.: WELL, I JUST WANTED A PLACE THAT WAS RAW AND SPARE. I WANTED IT TO LOOK LIKE EILEEN GREY AND JOSEPH BEUYS MOVED IN TOGETHER AND INVITED KISS OVER.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU THINK THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS AFFECTING DESIGNERS, NOT JUST PRACTICALLY BUT AESTHETICALLY?&nbsp; M.L.: DON&#39;T WE CALL IT IN FRENCH: &quot;REMETTRE LES PENDULES A L&#39;HEURE&quot;? FORGETTING ABOUT THE THIEVES, BANKERS OR TRADERS, DON&#39;T WE HAVE A AESTHETICAL PROBLEM EVERYWHERE? FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARS: NO MORE CAR TO DREAM ABOUT; ALL UGLY THE SAME. WHERE ARE THE DS 19 OR THE THUNDERBIRD OF OUR TIMES? AND INSTEAD OF WORKING ON THE NEW ELECTRIC CAR WHAT WERE ALL THOSE COMPANIES PRODUCING? AESTHETICALLY THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE TRYING TO BE TRUE TO ITSELF, AND MORALLY, TOO. CREATIVITY AND INDIVIDUALITY HAVE TO BE THE NEW CONCERNS. OF COURSE SO MANY PROBLEMS AND WARS TO OVERCOME. LEAVING IT ALL TO BARACK OBAMA, EVEN IF HE IS JUST THE FIGURE OF HOPE. AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO SAVE AFRICA? WE CAN JUST TRY TO DO WHAT WE KNOW. HOW TO DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN? BEST NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS, ISN&#39;T IT ?&nbsp; R.O.: I THINK IT&rsquo;S GOING TO HAVE A WONDERFUL PURIFYING EFFECT AND SEPERATE THE CHAFF FROM THE WHEAT.&nbsp; DO YOU THINK FASHION SHOULD BE PROVIDING ESCAPISM OR TONING DOWN TO SUIT THE MOOD?&nbsp; R.O.: I HAVE AN ADMITTEDLY PUERILE REACTION TO WHAT&rsquo;S APPROPRIATE OR SUITABLE. BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DO. IF I&rsquo;M PERCEIVED AS HAVING A DARK SIDE, IT&rsquo;S JUST PROBABLY AN INDULGENCE OF ID WICKEDNESS THAT WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN AMUSED AUDIENCE. I CERTAINLY DIDN&rsquo;T INVENT IT, AND IT&rsquo;S HAD MORE PERVASIVE MOMENTS THAN NOW. IN FIN-DE-SIECLE PARIS, SARAH BERNHARDT USED TO WEAR A TAXIDERMIED BAT IN HER HAIR WHILE HUYSMANS WAS WRITING ABOUT SATANIC RITUALS. SO I&rsquo;M CERTAINLY NOT TAPPING INTO ANYTHING NEW. EVERYONE WANTS A LITTLE EMPOWERMENT FROM WEARING THE SCALP OF THEIR ENEMY OR WEARING THEIR EQUIVALENT OF AN INTIMIDATING BLACK CAPE. I JUST MIGHT BE COMING FROM A POSITION THAT&rsquo;S A LITTLE MORE GOOD-HUMOURED AND TEASING. NOT DEFIANT OR ANGRY.&nbsp; WHAT YOU WILL BE PRESENTING AT THE ARNHEM BIENNALE?&nbsp; R.O.: SOMETHING GREY AND MYSTERIOUS WITH JOSEPH DIRAND.

DRAPED IN A BLACK CASHMERE SHAWL, WHICH COULD BE A FLAG OF HIS MULTIMILLION DOLLAR FASHION LABEL THAT PRODUCES AGGRESSIVE CLOTHING WITH ELEMENTS OF GOTH AND PUNK, OWENS IS SITTING AT ONE OF THE TABLES IN HIS SHOWROOM-CUM-STUDIO-CUM-APARTMENT ON PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON IN PARIS. IT IS THE MORNING AFTER HIS FALL/WINTER 2009 MENSWEAR RUNWAY SHOW, HIS FIRST IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. IT WAS AN INSTANT HIT. THE RAVE REVIEWS ARE ALREADY PUBLISHED BY THE FASHION PRESS, AND THE FIRST-FLOOR SHOWROOM IS SWARMED WITH STORE BUYERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE ROOM IS LONG AND NARROW, LINED WITH RACKS OF OWENS&rsquo;S SIGNATURE SLIM LEATHER JACKETS, ASYMMETRIC TAILORED COATS, AND FEATHERWEIGHT RAYON T-SHIRTS. HIS CHUNKY BLACK BOOTS (INCLUDING A MEN&rsquo;S PAIR FEATURING A FIVE-INCH HEEL), OVERSIZED SNEAKERS AND HUGE LEATHER BAGS ARE DISPLAYED IN THE ADJACENT ROOM. THE MAIN ROOM HAS A BACK GLASS WALL WITH A DOOR THAT OPENS ONTO A COURTYARD. TWO STUFFED MONKEYS ON A STAND (OWENS IS FASCINATED WITH MONKEYS) ARE THE ROOM&rsquo;S ONLY DECORATION. BLACK-CLAD ASSISTANTS RUSH AROUND FILLING ORDERS. TALL, SKINNY BOYS MODEL THE CLOTHES FOR THE BUYERS, PUTTING THEM ON AND RIPPING THEM OFF AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT. AND THE PHONE RINGS OFF THE HOOK. OWENS IS SIPPING COFFEE AND BUTTERING HIS RAISIN TOAST, NONPLUSSED THE HUBBUB. HIS TANNED FACE WITH EXPRESSIVE BROWN EYES AND LONG BLACK HAIR IS ABSOLUTELY CALM AND JUST A LITTLE BIT WEARY.&nbsp; THOUGH THE FASHION WORLD OFTEN CLAIMS THAT IT LOVES A REBEL, IT RARELY WELCOMES ONE. OWENS IS ONE OF THE FEW EXCEPTIONS WHO HAS NOT ONLY SURVIVED IN THIS CUTTHROAT BUSINESS, BUT HAS ALSO PROSPERED. HE WAS BORN IN LOS ANGELES IN 1961. HIS FAMILY SOON MOVED TO PORTERVILLE, A SMALL TOWN HALFWAY BETWEEN L.A. AND SAN FRANCISCO. AS A TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL, OWENS GOT INTO GOTH CULTURE. &ldquo;WEARING BLACK WAS A WAY TO PROJECT A MORE MENACING DEMEANOR, AND TO HIDE MY INSECURITIES,&rdquo; HE SAYS. STILL, THOSE YEARS HAVE LEFT A PERMANENT IMPRINT ON HIS STYLE. THERE IS NOTHING POLISHED ABOUT HIS DESIGNS. THE RAW AND TWISTED SEAMS, THE UNFINISHED HEMS, AND THE EARTHLY COLORS EMPHASIZE HIS DESIRE TO REFLECT A WORLD THAT IS IMPERFECT. THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT FIRST ATTRACTED ME TO HIS CLOTHES. THEY FIRMLY INSIST ON IMPERFECTION. THEY DEFY THE GLAMOUR FANTASY THAT THE POPULAR CULTURE, FASHION INCLUDED, TRIES TO CRAM DOWN OUR THROATS.&nbsp; AFTER FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL, OWENS MOVED TO LOS ANGELES TO STUDY ART HISTORY AT OTIS COLLEGE. HE DROPPED OUT IN HIS SECOND YEAR AND GOT A JOB AS A PATTERN MAKER IN A SPORTSWEAR COMPANY OWNED BY MICHELE LAMY, A FRENCH EXPATRIATE WHO FOR MANY YEARS LIVED IN LOS ANGELES. OWENS AND LAMY SOON STARTED AN AFFAIR. AT THE TIME LAMY HAD A HUSBAND AND OWENS, WHO IS BISEXUAL, HAD A BOYFRIEND. AFTER A WHILE, THEY SPLIT UP FROM THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND MOVED IN TOGETHER. LAMY CLOSED HER SPORTSWEAR BUSINESS AND OPENED A RESTAURANT, AND OWENS STARTED MAKING CLOTHES.&nbsp; LAMY DESCENDED THE STAIRS AND OWENS INTRODUCED US. SHE MAKES QUITE AN IMPRESSION, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE. IN HER SIXTIES, SHE IS PETITE AND FIERCE. HER PIERCING BLUE EYES, DEEPLY SET IN HER DARK FACE, ARE INQUISITIVE AND GLOW WITH ENERGY. SHE WAS DRESSED IN AN ALLIGATOR VEST, WITH A FUR VEST ON TOP OF IT, GREY-AND-BLACK TIGHTS WITH A RECTANGLE PATTERN, AND OVER-THE-KNEE BOOTS. A HUGE OXIDIZED SILVER NECKLACE RESEMBLING A CROSS HUNG ON HER NECK. SHE LOOKED LIKE A VIKING QUEEN MAGICALLY TRANSPORTED INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. I WISHED SHE&#39;D CARRIED A SWORD. &ldquo;YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TWO YEARS WE LIVED TOGETHER, I COULDN&rsquo;T UNDERSTAND A WORD SHE WAS SAYING,&rdquo; SAYS OWENS, &ldquo;AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE FRENCH ACCENT, BUT BECAUSE SHE IS A VERY INSTINCTUAL PERSON. SHE DOESN&rsquo;T FINISH SENTENCES. SHE HAS NO REGARD FOR PUNCTUATION. SHE TALKS WITH HER HANDS. AND IT&rsquo;S ALL VERY VAGUE, WHEREAS I AM REALLY A VERY PRAGMATIC PERSON. BUT THAT&rsquo;S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED. WE&rsquo;VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR NINETEEN YEARS.&rdquo;&nbsp; THEIR LIFE TOGETHER IN LOS ANGELES WAS INFUSED WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, BUT TODAY BOTH ARE COMPLETELY SOBER. OWENS WORKS OUT AT A LOCAL GYM ALMOST EVERY DAY, EVEN WHILE VISITING HIS FACTORY IN ITALY. &ldquo;I WORK OUT AND THEN I COME HOME AND TAKE A LITTLE NAP. I NEED THIS TIME TO MYSELF. OTHERWISE I GET OVERSATURATED. WHEN I USED TO LIVE IN LOS ANGELES I HAD A PERSONAL TRAINER AND WOULD TAKE STEROIDS. I LOVE STEROIDS. THEY GET YOU TO A HIGHER LEVEL WHEN YOU WORK OUT. OF COURSE I GOT TOO PUFFY, BUT THEY HELPED ME TO BUILD UP THE MUSCLE, AND ONCE I LOST ALL THAT TOP WEIGHT, I WAS IN GOOD SHAPE.&rdquo; OWENS&rsquo;S BODY IS NOW SLIM AND MUSCULAR, AND HE DOES NOT MIND DISPLAYING IT. HIS STORE IN PALAIS ROYAL FEATURES A NUDE WAX STATUE OF HIM THAT OWENS COMMISSIONED FROM THE ARTISANS AT MADAME TUSSAUDS. THIS STATUE WAS FIRST DISPLAYED IN 2006 AT PITTI UOMO, AN ITALIAN MENSWEAR FASHION FAIR. IT WAS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR, THE HANDS HOLDING ITS PENIS, OUT OF WHICH A CONSTANT STREAM OF FAKE URINE POURED ONTO SHATTERED GLASS. IN THE STORE, THE STATUE&rsquo;S LOWER PART IS COVERED IN A BLACK BLANKET. &ldquo;ONCE, RICK WAS IN THE STORE ADJUSTING THE BLANKET ON THE STATUE, AND SOME PEOPLE CAME INTO THE STORE AND WERE STARING AT ONE RICK FIDDLING WITH ANOTHER RICK&rsquo;S GROIN,&rdquo; RECALLED BARBARA AYME JOUVE, THE STORE MANAGER. &ldquo;AND I SAID, &lsquo;RICK, THERE ARE PEOPLE STARING AT YOU,&rsquo; AND HE TURNS AROUND, SMILES, AND DROPS THE BLANKET.&rdquo; OWENS&rsquo;S FASCINATION WITH THE DOUBLE IS APPARENT ELSEWHERE: IN A BOOK OF HIS PHOTOGRAPHS, &ldquo;L&#39;AI-JE BIEN DESCENDU?&rdquo; THERE IS A PICTURE OF OWENS URINATING INTO HIS DOPPELGANGER&rsquo;S MOUTH.&nbsp; FOR A WHILE OWENS AND LAMY LIVED IN AN APARTMENT OFF OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. LAMY SPENT MOST OF HER TIME AT THE RESTAURANT AND OWENS CONCENTRATED ON HIS DESIGNS. HE AVOIDED THE FASHION WORLD LIKE A PLAGUE. &ldquo;RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING I STEERED CLEAR OF THE EDITORS, PR COMPANIES AND STYLISTS. I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE STORES I THOUGHT HIGHLY OF, THE ONES THAT &lsquo;GOT&rsquo; FASHION. I SIMPLY SHOWED UP WITH A BAG OF CLOTHES AT THEIR DOOR AND I WOULDN&rsquo;T LEAVE UNTIL I MET WITH THE OWNER.&rdquo; SUCH PERSEVERANCE PAID OFF. OWENS FIRST GOT HIS CLOTHES INTO CHARLES GALLAY IN LOS ANGELES, AND THEN CUT AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL WITH MAXFIELD AFTER CHARLES GALLAY CLOSED. NEXT, OWENS WENT TO ALAN BILZERIAN, IN BOSTON. BY GOING DIRECTLY TO THE STORES, OWENS LET HIS CLOTHES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, AND PEOPLE RESPONDED TO HIS LANGUAGE OF DESTROYED LUXURY. HIS TALENT FOR COMBINING ELEGANCE WITH GRIT MANIFESTED IN WASHED SHRUNKEN LEATHER JACKETS WITH SUPER-SLIM ARMS AND CASHMERE T-SHIRTS WHOSE SEAMS WERE IRREVERENTLY SHREDDED. OWENS PRESENTED BEAUTY OF ANOTHER SORT, WITHOUT THE FATUOUS GLITTER. THIS WAS IN THE LATE NINETIES. BY THE END OF THE DECADE, THE AUDIENCE SLOWLY BEGAN TO RESPOND AND OWENS&rsquo;S NAME STARTED TO MAKE ITS ROUNDS IN THE FASHION CIRCLES, FINALLY REACHING ANNA WINTOUR, THE EDITOR OF AMERICAN VOGUE. WINTOUR GAVE OWENS PROMINENT COVERAGE IN THE MAGAZINE, WHICH ALSO SPONSORED HIS FIRST RUNWAY SHOW IN 2002, SEVEN YEARS AFTER HE STARTED SELLING CLOTHES IN STORES. IN THE SAME YEAR, WITH WINTOUR&rsquo;S INFLUENCE, OWENS RECEIVED AN AWARD FROM THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA (CFDA). SOON THEREAFTER, AN OLD FRENCH FUR HOUSE, REVILLON, TAPPED OWENS TO BE ITS CREATIVE DIRECTOR. AROUND THE SAME TIME OWENS DEVELOPED A FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH LUCA RUGGERI, WHOSE INVESTMENT FIRM PARTNERED WITH YOUNG DESIGNERS. FROM THE START, RUGGERI HAD FULL CONFIDENCE IN OWENS. &ldquo;I FIRST SAW RICK&rsquo;S WORK AT MARIA LUISA [A PARISIAN BOUTIQUE],&rdquo; SAYS RUGGERI, &ldquo;AND I WAS IMMEDIATELY INTRIGUED. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH UNCONVENTIONAL CLOTHES ANYWHERE. I ASKED THE OWNER WHO THE DESIGNER WAS, BECAUSE I NEVER HEARD OF HIM. NEXT TIME I WAS IN LOS ANGELES, I LOOKED RICK UP. WE HAD A MEETING AND WE HIT IT OFF.&rdquo; RUGGERI INVESTED IN OWENS, AND FOUND AN ITALIAN MANUFACTURER FOR HIM, OLMAR AND MIRTA. &ldquo;IT IS A REAL MOM-AND-POP OPERATION,&rdquo; OWENS SAYS, &ldquo;AND IT&rsquo;S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. THEY&rsquo;VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE MY DESIGNS, AND IT WAS HARD TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANTED TO DO. I LIVED SIX MONTHS OUT OF A YEAR IN THE FACTORY, BECAUSE THE TOWN DIDN&rsquo;T HAVE A HOTEL. THEY WERE REALLY NICE TO ME. THOUGH. THEY GAVE ME A ROOM WITH A COUCH, WHICH ALSO DOUBLED AS MY OFFICE, AND BUILT A SHOWER FOR ME.&rdquo; AROUND THE SAME TIME OWENS WAS HIRED AS A CREATIVE DIRECTOR FOR REVILLON, AN OLD FRENCH FUR COMPANY. FINALLY, SHUTTLING BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND EUROPE BECAME UNBEARABLE, AND IN 2003 OWENS AND LAMY MOVED TO PARIS.&nbsp; TODAY OWENS FEELS AT HOME IN THE CITY OF LIGHT. &ldquo;FROM MY PLACE I WALK THROUGH THE TUILERIES GARDENS TO PALAIS ROYAL [HIS BOUTIQUE NEAR THE LOUVRE], AND TO MY GYM. TO SAY THAT IT&rsquo;S MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS AMAZING. IT JUST BLOWS ME AWAY. WHEN WE FIRST MOVED AND WE WOULD DRIVE THROUGH PLACE DE LA CONCORDE ON THE WAY HOME, I WOULD THINK, &lsquo;THAT&rsquo;S INCREDIBLE. THAT&rsquo;S WHAT MY LIFE IS LIKE NOW.&rsquo; AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, NOW EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I FORGET TO NOTICE ALL THIS SPLENDOR AND I GET MAD AT MYSELF.&rdquo; DESPITE THE MOVE, OWENS STILL KEEPS TIES WITH HIS PARENTS IN PORTERVILLE. &ldquo;I BRING THEM TO PARIS TWICE A YEAR FOR MY WOMEN&rsquo;S SHOWS. FIRST IT WAS A HUGE DEAL FOR MY PARENTS TO COME HERE, BECAUSE THEY ARE FROM A SMALL TOWN AND THEY NEVER TRAVELED, BUT NOW THEY ARE BORED WITH PARIS. I LIKE BRINGING THEM HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL PROTECTIVE OF ME, AND I LIKE TO FEEL THAT. OF COURSE THEY CAN BE OVERPOWERING, ESPECIALLY MY DAD. HE USED TO BE A REAL FUNDAMENTALIST. HE&#39;S MELLOWED OUT NOW, BUT HE STILL WILL SAY SOMETHING HILARIOUS, LIKE, &lsquo;DON&rsquo;T YOU KNOW ANY HETEROSEXUALS?&rsquo; I THINK THAT MY SUCCESS HAS FORCED HIM TO COME TO TERMS WITH MY WAY OF LIFE. MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING. I STILL TEASE HIM SOMETIMES. HE&rsquo;LL INTRODUCE ME TO SOMEONE AND SAY, &lsquo;THIS IS MY SON. HE IS A BUSINESSMAN IN FASHION,&rsquo; AND I&rsquo;LL SAY, &lsquo;I DON&rsquo;T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS. I&rsquo;M JUST A BIG SISSY MAKING DRESSES.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; THE FRENCH HAVE A NOTORIOUSLY AMBIVALENT RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICAN CULTURE, AND OWENS WAS UNSURE OF THE RECEPTION HE WOULD GET DESIGNING FOR REVILLON. &ldquo;AN AMERICAN DESIGNING FOR A VENERABLE OLD FRENCH HOUSE IS NOT EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING THAT BOWLS THEM OVER, BUT I DID NOT CARE. I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE IN REVITALIZATION OF OLD FASHION HOUSES. IT&rsquo;S A PUSSY THING TO DO, JUST FOR THE PAYCHECK. IT&rsquo;S SO MUCH MORE HARDCORE TO DO YOUR OWN THING. SO, I DID NOT FEEL THE WEIGHT OF TRADITION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, AND I STARTED FROM SCRATCH. I THINK IN THE END I WON THEM OVER.&rdquo; IT IS HARD TO SAY WHAT THE FRENCH LOVE IN OWENS. MAYBE IT WAS HIS GIG AT REVILLON, WHICH LASTED BRIEFLY BEFORE THAT COMPANY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS. OR MAYBE THEIR FASCINATION WITH OWENS WAS OF THE SORT OF THE COMPLACENT BOURGEOIS WATCHING A WESTERN. AND HERE WAS A DRUGSTORE COWBOY OF THEIR OWN: WEIRD, UNCONVENTIONAL AND A COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THEM.&nbsp; PERHAPS THIS ENIGMATIC IMAGE IS WHAT ALSO LURES CELEBRITIES TO HIS WORK, BECAUSE OWENS IS CURRENTLY IN THE SPOTLIGHT. THE ONLINE AND PRINT TABLOIDS ARE FULL OF IMAGES OF STARS WITH (JENNIFER ANISTON, LINDSAY LOHAN) AND WITHOUT OCCUPATIONS (THE OLSEN TWINS, VICTORIA BECKHAM) WEARING OWENS&rsquo;S CLINGY TEES AND SHRUNKEN LEATHER JACKETS. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, THE MALE POP ROYALTY LIKE JOHN MAYER AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE HAVE MADE OWENS&rsquo;S JUMBO SNEAKERS (WHICH RETAIL FOR $1400) THEIR FOOTWEAR OF CHOICE. OWENS IS AWARE THAT HIS DESIGNS ARE BECOMING TRENDY, BUT THIS DOES NOT BOTHER HIM. HE IS CONFIDENT THAT THIS GLITZY EXPOSURE WILL NOT ALIENATE HIS LONGTIME FANS. &ldquo;I AM PLEASED THAT PEOPLE RESPOND TO MY WORK. IT IS VALIDATING. AND VALIDATION, AS OPRAH WINFREY SAYS, IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE. I AM VERY LUCKY THAT ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE RESPOND TO MY WORK. SEEING SOMEONE IN MY CLOTHES ALWAYS MAKES ME HAPPY. I CAN&rsquo;T THINK OF THE DOWNSIDE.&rdquo;&nbsp; II&nbsp; DESPITE BEING FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL, OWENS GROWS HIS BUSINESS CAREFULLY. IT NOW COMPRISES THE MAIN LINE FOR MEN AND WOMEN, THE DENIM LINE DRKSHDW FOR BOTH SEXES, A LOWER-PRICED WOMEN&rsquo;S LINE CALLED LILIES, A LINE OF FURS CALLED PALAIS ROYAL, AND A FURNITURE LINE THAT OWENS SELLS IN A PARIS ART GALLERY. &ldquo;THE FURNITURE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, REALLY,&rdquo; SAYS OWENS. &ldquo;ONCE WE GOT TO PARIS, I COULDN&rsquo;T AFFORD THE FURNITURE THAT I LIKED, BECAUSE I WANTED ORIGINAL STUFF FROM LE CORBUSIER AND ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS. BESIDES, I LIKE EVERYTHING TO BE OVERSIZED AND EVERYTHING I SAW WAS SO SMALL! SO I MADE MY OWN STUFF. THEN WE DECIDED TO SHOW IT AT A GALLERY, AND IT KIND OF STUCK.&rdquo;&nbsp; TODAY OWENS HAS SIX ASSISTANTS: THREE IN ITALY AND THREE IN PARIS. &ldquo;MANUFACTURING IN ITALY WAS NOT AN EASY TRANSITION. IN L.A. I WAS USED TO WORKING IN AN ISOLATED AND RECLUSIVE WAY. AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HAD TO COMMUNICATE MY IDEAS AND RESPOND TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND I AM NOT THAT GREGARIOUS.&rdquo;&nbsp; HIS DESIGNS SELL IN THREE HUNDRED STORES WORLDWIDE, AND OWENS HAS A BOUTIQUE IN PARIS AND NEW YORK. HIS THIRD STORE WILL OPEN IN LONDON IN MARCH, AND HE IS EXPLORING POTENTIAL RETAIL PARTNERSHIPS IN SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN.&nbsp; STILL, OWENS CONSIDERS HIS COMPANY SMALL, AND HE IS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. &ldquo;BECAUSE WE ARE A NICHE COMPANY, I CAN AFFORD NOT TO CHANGE FROM SEASON TO SEASON. AND THUS I CAN INSIST ON MY OWN VOICE. I HAVE AN AUDIENCE THAT I COMMUNICATE WITH, AND IT IS FAIRLY SMALL. IF I HAD TO COMMUNICATE WITH A MUCH LARGER AUDIENCE, THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE CHALLENGING. THIS WAY, I CAN GO AS FAR AS I WANT, AND I HAVE NO RESTRAINTS. IT IS A TREMENDOUSLY LUXURIOUS PLACE TO BE.&rdquo; YET, OWENS IS PRAGMATIC, &ldquo;OF COURSE, I AM NOT IRRESPONSIBLE. I KNOW THAT I HAVE TO SELL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LEATHER JACKETS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH FUR, FOR EXAMPLE, AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE TO HAVE SEVERAL T-SHIRTS IN EVERY COLLECTION. BUT THESE ARE NOT COMPROMISES.&rdquo;&nbsp; ALTHOUGH HE WANTS TO EXPAND, OWENS IS WARY ABOUT GROWING HIS BUSINESS TOO MUCH AND ALIENATING HIS CORE CUSTOMERS. HE WANTS TO CREATE A PERFUME, AND HE HAS BEEN TALKING TO SEVERAL BEAUTY CONGLOMERATES. &ldquo;IN ORDER TO DO THE PERFUME RIGHT WITH A BIG COMPANY, YOU HAVE TO ADVERTISE. IF I DON&rsquo;T COMMIT TO ADVERTISING, THEY WON&rsquo;T COMMIT TO CREATING A SCENT FOR ME. BUT I AM VERY RELUCTANT TO ADVERTISE. WHEN I SAW A FIRST YOHJI YAMAMOTO PERFUME AD, I KIND OF CRINGED, PRECISELY BECAUSE I HAVE UTTER RESPECT FOR YOHJI&rsquo;S WORK. I WOULD NOT WANT THE SAME THING HAPPENING TO ME. AT THE SAME TIME, SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS ARE URGING ME TO DO A PERFUME AND ADVERTISE IT. AT FIRST I RESISTED. THEN I REALIZED THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN &lsquo;FASHION MOMENT.&rsquo; I REMEMBER THOSE COMME DES GARCONS PERFUME ADS WITH THE GHETTO KIDS WITH THE BRACES, OR THE FIRST MINIMALIST HELMUT LANG ADS, THESE WERE FASHION MOMENTS. I UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY DON&rsquo;T WANT ADVERTISING FOR THE SAKE OF ADVERTISING; THEY WANT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. STILL, I AM NOT GOING TO ADVERTISE BECAUSE OF THE CRINGE-INDUCING SELL-OUT ELEMENT UNLESS I FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. I THINK AT THIS POINT MY CUSTOMER LIKES ME WHERE I AM WITHOUT ANY ADVERTISING.&rdquo; STILL, THE PERFUME IS ON OWENS&rsquo;S AGENDA. HE WANTS TO CAPTURE HIS FASCINATION WITH LIFE AND DEATH IN A SCENT. &ldquo;I THINK THE BOTTOM NOTE WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE INCENSE, TO REFLECT DEATH,&rdquo; OWENS SAYS, &ldquo;AND THE TOP NOTE WOULD PROBABLY SMELL LIKE A LILY, TO REFLECT LIFE. AND MAYBE I&rsquo;LL ADD SOME MENTHOL TO THAT.&rdquo;&nbsp; BUT FOR NOW OWENS IS CONTENT WITH HIS WORK. &ldquo;I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT ME GOING TO &lsquo;THE NEXT LEVEL.&rsquo; WHAT IS THIS NEXT LEVEL? I HAVE ENOUGH WORK. I GET TO EXPRESS MYSELF EVERY MINUTE OF MY LIFE. I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW. I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SOCIAL PRESSURE OR WITH PEOPLE INTRUDING IN MY LIFE JUST BECAUSE I AM FAMOUS. THE MONEY WILL COME. WE HAVE A STEADY BUSINESS AND I HOPE IT CONTINUES THIS WAY. OF COURSE, THAT&rsquo;S MY ATTITUDE NOW. WHO KNOWS WHAT I&rsquo;LL WANT IN TWO YEARS.&rdquo;&nbsp; OWENS UNDERSTANDS THAT FASHION IS FICKLE AND IS IN CONSTANT DEMAND OF THE NEW, BUT HIS DESIGNS ARE BASED ON CONSISTENCY. &ldquo;PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IF I WILL RUN OUT OF IDEAS. AND REALLY, I&rsquo;VE GOT THEM ALL. I JUST NEED TO SORT THEM OUT AND SLOWLY DEVELOP THEM. JUMPING FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER IS NOT FOR ME. I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE DO IT BECAUSE THEY DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.&rdquo;&nbsp; MAINTAINING THE DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN ARTISTRY AND COMMERCE IS SOMETHING THAT OWENS HOPES TO TEACH HIS PROT&Eacute;G&Eacute;, A YOUNG PROMISING LONDON DESIGNER NAMED GARETH PUGH WHO IS FAMOUS FOR HIS THEATRICAL PRESENTATIONS. &ldquo;I APPLAUD GARETH&rsquo;S VISION, AND I AM HIS MOST ARDENT SUPPORTER, BUT HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN TO PRODUCE WEARABLE CLOTHING IN ORDER TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND EXPERIMENT WITH THE MORE EXTREME STUFF. I WAS JUST TRYING ON SOME OF HIS CLOTHES BEFORE THE SHOW AND I TOLD HIM THAT I WILL GLADLY CARRY IT IN MY STORE--IN BLACK.&rdquo; OWENS WAS SAYING THIS PEERING OVER MY SHOULDER AS THE LAST SHIPMENT OF CLOTHES FOR PUGH&rsquo;S COLLECTION WAS ARRIVING THROUGH THE DOOR JUST A DAY BEFORE THE SHOW.&nbsp; III&nbsp; OWENS DRAWS INSPIRATION FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. HIS OWN LIFE IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THEM. THE GOTH CULTURE IS REFLECTED HEAVILY IN HIS DESIGNS, BUT ALSO PUNK AND GLAM ROCK. MODERNIST ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE ARE AMONG HIS OTHER INFLUENCES. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S LIKE A LITTLE RITUAL FOR ME. I LOOK AT THE WORK OF BRANCUSI, LE CORBUSIER, LUIGI MORETTI; ALL OF THESE CLEAN LINES THAT ARE IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT PLACES IN THEIR WORK REMIND ME THAT I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO MAKE A LOT OF CHANGES. I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO ADD SOME MORE STRAPS TO MAKE IT INTERESTING. I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING SUPERFLUOUS. AND ALL OF THEIR CREATIONS FIT IN PERFECTLY WITH THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE IN. AND THAT&rsquo;S WHAT I TRY TO DO. OF COURSE, MY ENVIRONMENT IS A FANTASY.&rdquo;&nbsp; THE FANTASY THAT OWENS MANIFESTS IN HIS CLOTHES IS APPARENT IN EVERYTHING HE DOES, FROM HIS FASCINATION WITH ARTIFICE AND CAMP TO THE NAMES OF THE COLORS HE USES FOR HIS DESIGNS: &ldquo;MILK,&rdquo; &ldquo;PEARL,&rdquo; &ldquo;DUST,&rdquo; AND &ldquo;DARK SHADOW.&rdquo; THE ONLY COLOR UNTOUCHED BY A NAME IS BLACK. &ldquo;&rsquo;DUST&rsquo; IS SUCH AN ETERNAL, BIBLICAL WORD THAT HAS BECOME REPRESENTATIVE OF EVERYTHING I WANTED TO PROJECT,&rdquo; SAYS OWENS, &ldquo;IN THE BEGINNING, ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS LIGHT GREY. I&rsquo;VE BEEN WEARING BLACK ALL THROUGHOUT MY ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULTHOOD, AND WHEN I LOOK BACK I SEE THAT AS AN EXPRESSION OF FEAR. I WAS HIDING BEHIND BLACK. I HAVE COME TO LOOK AT IT ALMOST AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS AND BEGAN THINKING THAT GREY IS A BRAVE COLOR TO WEAR, BECAUSE THERE IS AMBIGUITY AND GENTLENESS TO IT; IT IS MODEST, RESTRAINED AND DIGNIFIED, TENDER AND NOT AGGRESSIVE. BLACK IS AN EXCLUSIVE COLOR, AND DUST IS INCLUSIVE. WE ALL BECOME DUST. SO THAT NAME STUCK. AND &lsquo;DARK SHADOW,&rsquo; WELL, THAT WAS JUST A PRETTY NAME FOR A COLOR.&rdquo;&nbsp; THE INFLUENCE OF ARCHITECTURE EXTENDS TO OWENS&rsquo;S CHOICE OF FABRICS. &ldquo;WHEN I AM LOOKING AT A NEW FABRIC, I THINK, &lsquo;WILL THIS WORK IN A JEAN-MICHEL FRANK ROOM?&rsquo; I LIKE FABRICS THAT ARE EITHER CASUAL BUT USED IN A SUMPTUOUS WAY, OR SUMPTUOUS BUT USED IN A CASUAL WAY. I HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MILLS I USE, AND THEY ARE WILLING TO EXPERIMENT WITH ME. THIS WAY I CAN CREATE FABRIC MIXES FROM SCRATCH. I STILL WORK ON THE FABRICS A LOT. I FEEL LIKE I&rsquo;VE DONE MANY EXPERIMENTS WITH THE SILHOUETTE, BUT I HAVEN&rsquo;T MANIPULATED THE FABRIC ITSELF ENOUGH. THIS SEASON I WORKED WITH A TAPESTRY MAKER TO GET A CERTAIN TEXTURE AND IT ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE POLYNESIAN PLACEMATS YOU BUY AT A GIFT SHOP. IT WAS AWFUL. BUT IT&rsquo;S A START.&rdquo;&nbsp; IN THE CURRENT MEN&rsquo;S COLLECTION OWENS ADDED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TAILORING, WHOSE STRUCTURE ALSO REMINDS HIM OF ARCHITECTURE. &ldquo;I AM TRYING TO ADD MORE TAILORING, BUT IT&rsquo;S A NIGHTMARE. I CAN&rsquo;T FIND A TAILOR THAT CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANT. THE TRADITIONAL TAILORS ARE SO UPTIGHT ABOUT THE CLASSIC SILHOUETTE. IT IS VERY HARD TO DO SOMETHING NEW. YOU ARE DEALING WITH SOMEONE WHO IS PROUD OF THEIR CREATIVITY, AND YOU HAVE TO IN TURN TO DOMINATE THEM WITH YOUR VISION WITHOUT DISRESPECTING THEM.&rdquo;&nbsp; THE ARCHITECTS IN TURN RESPOND TO OWENS. ANDREW DRYDEN, OF THE ARCHITECTURE FIRM BJARKE INGELS GROUP IN COPENHAGEN, IS A BIG FAN OF HIS WORK. &ldquo;I LOVE THE RAW FEELINGS OF RICK&rsquo;S CLOTHES, THE SHARPLY CUT FORMS AND HIS ABILITY TO PLAY WITH PROPORTION THAT GOES TO THE EXTREME WITHOUT BECOMING CARTOONISH. THE CLOTHES ARE BOTH REFINED AND CRUDE, GRACEFUL AND GOTHIC. THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN HEAVY BRUTALISM AND GRACE. WHEN I PUT ON HIS CLOTHES, I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE AN EXTENSION OF MYSELF.&rdquo;&nbsp; IV&nbsp; A FEW HOURS LATER AFTER INTERVIEWING OWENS, I WAS SITTING ON A LOW-SLUNG COUCH IN HIS PARIS STORE, OBSERVING THE SCENE. THE GALLERY OF SHOPS AT PALAIS ROYAL FRAME A BEAUTIFUL TREE-LINED GARDEN. PEOPLE STROLL PAST THE SMALL BOUTIQUES, PEERING IN THROUGH THE WINDOWS. THE STORE OCCUPIES A SMALL, TWO-STORY SPACE. THE FIRST FLOOR IS DIVIDED INTO TWO ROOMS. ONE DISPLAYS THE MENSWEAR AND THE OTHER ONE WOMENSWEAR. THE TOP FLOOR HAS ONLY ONE ROOM THAT HOUSES SALE MERCHANDISE AND A RACK OF FUR JACKETS FROM OWENS&rsquo;S FUR LINE. THE INTERIOR OF THE STORE IS DONE IN EARTHLY COLORS. THE WALLS ARE PAINTED OFF-WHITE AND THE FLOORS AND BIRCH PLYWOOD DISPLAYS ARE COVERED IN BROWN CARPET. BROWN WOOL FELT BLANKETS ARE WRAPPED AROUND THE BUILDING&rsquo;S INTERNAL FIXTURES AND BROWN CURTAINS COVER THE WINDOWS. EACH OF THE ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR HAS A SCULPTURE CREATED BY OWENS: MOOSE HORNS SUPPORTED BY TWO OSTRICH EGGS AND A SKULL. THE EGGS SYMBOLIZE LIFE, THE SKULL SYMBOLIZES DEATH, AND MOOSE HORNS SYMBOLIZE HONOR. THE INFAMOUS WAX STATUE TOWERS OVER THE FIRST-FLOOR CASH REGISTER. OWENS&rsquo;S STORE IN LONDON WILL FEATURE HIS WAX HEAD ON A PLATE. AS OWENS TOLD ONE PUBLICATION, HE WAS GOING FOR &ldquo;A MORE CLASSICAL MOOD.&rdquo;&nbsp; THE BOUTIQUE WAS SWARMING WITH PEOPLE. THE PARISIAN HAUTE BOURGEOIS, WITH THEIR LAPDOGS IN HAND, WERE MIXING WITH THE ITALIANS IN THEIR MANDATORY OVER-EMBELLISHED JEANS. FRENCH TEENAGERS AND YOUNG JAPANESE TOURISTS WERE TRYING ON OWENS&rsquo;S SNEAKERS. THREE MIDDLE-AGED RUSSIANS WALKED IN AND STROLLED AROUND. THE WOMAN TURNED TO HER COMPANIONS AND SAID, &ldquo;THIS GUY IS HOT RIGHT NOW.&rdquo; THEY WALKED OVER TO THE DISPLAY CASE BY THE SHOP WINDOW AND STARED AT THE FIVE-INCH HEELS. &ldquo;THOSE ARE FOR MEN,&rdquo; ONE OF THEM GIGGLED, AND THEY LEFT.&nbsp; THERE WERE VERY FEW CLIENTS IN THE STORE THAT LOOKED LIKE DIE-HARD RICK OWENS CLIENTS, ALTHOUGH ONE COUPLE MADE FOR A BEAUTIFUL EXCEPTION. TONY GREENLAND AND PASCALE YOUF, OF THE LONDON ARCHITECTURE FIRM SEVENTH WAVE, ARE ARDENT SUPPORTERS OF OWENS. EVERY FEW MONTHS THEY TREK FROM LONDON TO PARIS JUST TO SHOP AT THE STORE. &ldquo;WE LOVE HIS WORK PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS SO ARCHITECTURAL. IT DOES NOT MERELY CONFORM TO HUMAN ANATOMY, BUT TRIES TO GO BEYOND IT.&rdquo; AND THEY WORE THE CLOTHES TO PROVE IT. GREENLAND WORE OWENS&rsquo;S JEANS, WHICH ARE USUALLY IN HIGH DEMAND, A LONG SLEEVE TEE, AND A MOTORCYCLE LEATHER VEST. YOUF WAS SPORTING ONE OF OWENS&rsquo;S LEATHER JACKETS WHOSE CLEAN GEOMETRIC LINES FORMED TWO TRIANGLES THAT EXTENDED AWAY FROM THE BODY AT THE TOP AND AT THE BOTTOM. THE JACKET LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF &ldquo;TRANSFORMERS.&rdquo; TO COMPLETE THIS EXTREME ENSEMBLE, SHE WORE OWENS&rsquo;S SILVER OVER-THE-KNEE BOOTS WITH A WEDGE HEEL THAT SLANTED FORTY-FIVE DEGREES. TWO LARGE SHOPPING BAGS FULL WITH OWENS&rsquo;S GARMENTS THEY JUST PURCHASED STOOD IN FRONT OF THEM.&nbsp; BARBARA AYME JOUVE, THE MANAGING PARTNER AT THE STORE, GLIDED AROUND LIKE A FAIRY, DASHING BETWEEN THE ROOMS, BALANCING A TRAY WITH COFFEE FOR ONE CUSTOMER IN ONE HAND AND A LEATHER JACKET FOR ANOTHER CUSTOMER IN THE OTHER HAND. FOUR OTHER SALES ASSISTANTS WERE HELPING HER. A STRIKING CALIFORNIA BLOND, JOUVE HAS LIVED AND WORKED IN PARIS FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. SHE WORE A TIGHT BLACK LEATHER JACKET, A BLACK SKIRT, AND A PAIR OF BLACK BOOTS &ndash; ALL BY OWENS, OF COURSE. HER BEAUTIFUL BLUE EYES GLOWED WITH ENTHUSIASM AS SHE SURVEYED THE STORE. BEFORE GOING TO WORK WITH OWENS, JOUVE MANAGED ANOTHER STORE THAT WAS HOUSED IN THE SAME SPACE, AND WHICH WENT OUT OF BUSINESS. WHEN OWENS APPROACHED HER ABOUT A RETAIL PARTNERSHIP, SHE HAD NO SECOND THOUGHTS, &ldquo;BUT IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL.&rdquo;&nbsp; WE WERE FLIPPING THROUGH THE BOOK OF OWENS&rsquo;S PHOTOS WHEN THE PHONE RANG. IT WAS BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN&rsquo;S STYLIST. &ldquo;BRUCE WANTS THOSE BLACK JEANS. HE LOVES THE FIRST PAIR SO MUCH, HE WON&rsquo;T WEAR ANYTHING ELSE. PLEASE SEND THEM RIGHT AWAY.&rdquo; (SPRINGSTEEN WORE A PAIR OF BLACK WAXED JEANS FOR HIS SUPER BOWL PERFORMANCE.) THE PEOPLE KEPT WALKING IN AND OUT. THE STAFF NO LONGER BOTHERED WITH THE DOOR BELL, LEAVING THE DOOR AJAR. I REMEMBERED OWENS&rsquo;S WORDS, &ldquo;I AM HAPPY TO SELL TO ANYONE. I AM GLAD PEOPLE RELATE TO MY WORK.&rdquo; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

CAN YOU RELATE TO IT?&nbsp; TOTALLY RELATE TO IT. TO ME IT MEANS ALTER IT, ENHANCE IT, EXAGGERATE IT, EMPHASIZE IT, CORRUPT IT, CELEBRATE IT, OWN IT.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;RE FAMOUS FOR TWISTING CLASSICS, SUCH AS THE BIKER JACKET AND BIAS SKIRTS, GIVING THEM A NEW IDENTITY. DO YOU FEEL THAT WHAT YOU DO IS MORE TIMELESS THAN TIMELY?&nbsp; THAT&rsquo;S WHAT I WAS AIMING FOR. TIME WILL TELL.&nbsp; THE CLOTHES THAT YOU DESIGN ARE REFRESHINGLY WEARABLE AND EASY TO COMBINE. ARE YOU INSPIRED BY WHAT YOU SEE ON THE STREET OR DO YOU FEEL DISTANCED FROM IT?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M NOT ON THE STREETS THE WAY I USED TO BE, BUT I REMEMBER THE BASIC IDEAS: ANTI-CONVENTIONAL FLAMBOYANCE, EMBRACING THE GROTESQUE, FEELING IMMORTAL. AS I GOT OLDER I&rsquo;D KIND OF GOTTEN IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM SO MY AESTHETIC GOT MORE RELAXED. BUT THERE REMAIN VESTIGES.&nbsp; CAN YOU TALK ME THROUGH YOUR SPRING/SUMMER COLLECTION?&nbsp; IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS BOTH AUSTERE AND EROTIC. I WAS KIND OF THINKING &ldquo;HEALTHY, DISCIPLINED, HARD ELEGANCE.&rdquo;&nbsp; THERE WAS A FEELING OF EASE AND COMFORT IN THAT COLLECTION. DO YOU THINK SIMPLICITY IS NECESSARY IN UNCERTAIN TIMES?&nbsp; ON THE CONTRARY, I THINK THAT DURING HARD TIMES PEOPLE ARE ONLY GOING TO BUY SOMETHING THAT TRULY ENGAGES THEM. AND IT MIGHT BE THE MOMENT FOR A FRIVOLOUS DEFIANT GESTURE. BUT I SUPPOSE ANYTIME&rsquo;S A GOOD TIME FOR THAT.&nbsp; DID RELIGION INSPIRE YOU FOR THAT LAST SHOW? SOME ELEMENTS SEEMED TO REFER TO ANCIENT EGYPT AND PRIESTS. WERE YOU ATTRACTED BY THAT KIND OF IMAGERY?&nbsp; I DO LOVE A BIT OF MYSTICISM. I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE IN ANY BUT I&rsquo;M SO ATTRACTED BY RITUAL AND DEVOTION. I RATHER GLIBLY DESCRIBED MY SHOW AS &ldquo;PRIESTESSES OF LONGING,&rdquo; BUT IT SOUNDS NICE, DOESN&rsquo;T IT? DICTIONARY LONGING IS SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO: SALOME&rsquo;S LONGING FOR JOHN THE BAPTIST, GRIMLY DETERMINED HOURS AT THE GYM LONGING FOR HEALTH AND A PERFECT BODY, DRUG HIGHS LONGING FOR EUPHORIA. LONGING FOR VALIDATION. IT&rsquo;S A TIMELESS, CLASSIC MOTIF.&nbsp; THE SILHOUETTE YOU CREATED WAS BOTH SOFT AND FLUID, EVEN WHEN YOU SHOWED MORE TAILORED PIECES. WHAT FABRICS DID YOU USE TO GET THAT EFFECT?&nbsp; ALWAYS MY GEORGETTES, CREPES AND SILK GAZARS, BUT THIS SEASON I HAD A FANTASTICALLY DRAPABLE SOFT FINISH FOR ALLIGATOR THAT I&lsquo;M GONNA BE WORKING &#39;TIL YOU ALL GET REALLY SICK OF IT.&nbsp; THE FOOTWEAR WAS SLIGHTLY ODD. WHAT WAS THE IDEA BEHIND IT?&nbsp; WAS IT ODD? HAVING WEIGHT AT THE END OF THE LEG MAKES LEGS LOOK SKINNIER AND KIND OF FLOPPY, AND HAVING THAT WEIGHT DRAG JUST ADDS A NICE NOTE OF ABANDON.&nbsp; I KNOW YOU LOVE KLAUS NOMI. HE WAS A MASTER AT DISTORTING THINGS, STARTING WITH HIS OWN VOICE. ARE THERE SOME OF HIS SONGS THAT YOU LOVE MORE THAN OTHERS?&nbsp; I PREFER HIS STRAIGHT ARIAS TO THE POP STUFF. THE POP SONGS DATED A BIT. BUT I STILL LISTEN TO HIS &ldquo;SAMSON AND DELILAH&rdquo; AND &ldquo;DIDO AND AENAES&rdquo; ARIAS. TALK ABOUT LONGING! THOSE SONGS SUNG BY A MAN IN ASPIRATIONAL MAKEUP ARE DRIPPING WITH IT.&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON AT THE MOMENT? ANY EXCITING TRIPS TO LOOK FORWARD TO?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M LAUNCHING MEN&rsquo;S, DENIM, WOMEN&#39;S PRECOLLECTION AND THE FURS FOR JANUARY SALES. BUT I&rsquo;LL TAKE A WEEK OFF FOR SOME DISCIPLINED HARD ELEGANT SUN IN MOROCCO FOR CHRISTMAS.&nbsp; YOUR BUSINESS HAS GROWN SLOWLY BUT STEADILY OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS.

WHAT TOOK YOU DOWN THIS PATH IN LIFE?&nbsp; I ALWAYS LIKED THE IDEA OF COMPLETE ABANDON. THROWING EVERYTHING AWAY FOR AN IDEAL. LIKE JOINING AN ORDER OR BECOMING A JUNKIE. WHAT LEADS PEOPLE WHO ARE PERFECTLY INTELLIGENT TO THROW IT ALL AWAY? TO COMMIT TO ONE PURSUIT? I DIDN&#39;T THINK I HAD THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA TO DO IT AS AN ARTIST SO I DID IT AS A DESIGNER. WITH FAR BETTER RESULTS THAN I IMAGINED. I HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE A TRAGIC FAILURE.&nbsp; WERE THERE PARTICULAR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT YOUR EARLIER CAREER WHO INSPIRED YOU?&nbsp; APART FROM ADMIRING BANDS AND ARTISTS FROM AFAR, I HAD A GROUP OF FRIENDS FROM ART SCHOOL THAT HAD A VERY ATTRACTIVE SENSE OF KNOWING THEMSELVES. LATER WE DRIFTED APART AND I&#39;M AFRAID I&#39;LL PROBABLY NEVER MAKE AN EFFORT TO HOOK UP WITH THEM AGAIN.&nbsp; WHAT INSPIRES YOU?&nbsp; WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY JAPANESE AESTHETICS; SLOW, GREY, RAKU TEA CEREMONIES AND EMPTY ROOMS WITH PAPER WALLS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, CRAZY-ASS KABUKI AND NOH THEATRE. I LOVE DISCIPLINE CAMOUFLAGED IN ARTIFICE.&nbsp; THE FASHION WORLD HAS AN ONGOING DEBATE OVER CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL FASHION, AND BRIDGING THE GAP TO FIND INNOVATION. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION OVER THE DEBATE?&nbsp; WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT, I ALWAYS RESENTED HOW RADICAL OR EXTREME FASHION WAS PRESENTED ON THE RUNWAY AS AN EXPERIMENT THAT WOULD NEVER BE AVAILABLE IN A STORE. OR HOW A DESIGNER WOULD PRESENT WOMEN AS WEDDING CAKES AND THEN TAKE A BOW IN JEANS AND TRAINERS. I HATED JEANS AND TRAINERS. I WANTED TO CORRUPT CONVENTION BY DISTORTING AND ALTERING THE BODY, BUT IN A SOFT, WORN, GREY WAY, TO MAKE IT EASY TO DIGEST. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A STEALTHIER METHOD OF TRANSGRESSION AND ULTIMATELY MORE HARDCORE. NOW I LOOK BACK AFFECTIONATELY AT THAT EARLY ATTITUDE AS ADOLESCENTLY MILITANT, BUT THE BASIC URGE IS STILL THERE. PEOPLE TELL ME THAT I&#39;VE BEEN INFLUENTIAL, BUT I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY. MAYBE I HELPED. AND I ENDED UP MAKING JEANS AND TRAINERS, BUT MY WAY.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT REINTERPRETING THE PAST AND FINDING THE NEW?&nbsp; WELL, NO ONE LIVES IN A VACUUM. EVERYTHING I DO IS MY PERSONAL BLEND OF EVERYTHING I&#39;VE EVER SEEN AND FELT. THIS MUST APPLY TO EVERY OTHER CREATOR IN HISTORY. THIS IS WHAT BINDS THE CREATOR TO THE SPECTATOR: SHARED REFERENCES. OF COURSE SOME CREATORS EXPRESS THEIR REFERENCES MORE LITERALLY THAN OTHERS.&nbsp; TELL US ABOUT THE MOVE TO PARIS AND THE CHANGES TO YOUR WORK AND LIFE SINCE THE MOVE? IT ALL FELT LIKE A NATURAL EVOLUTION. OF COURSE I&#39;D BEEN SELLING CLOTHES FOR 6 YEARS AND HAD A LITTLE ENDORSEMENT FROM AMERICAN VOGUE, SO I DIDN&#39;T COME COLD. AND THE JURY WAS OUT FOR A WHILE ON WHETHER MY STORY WORKED HERE OR NOT. IT&#39;S ONLY FAIRLY RECENTLY THAT I FEEL LIKE THEY&#39;LL LET ME STAY.&nbsp; I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE HERE ALTHOUGH I&#39;VE LIVED HERE FOR 6 YEARS NOW AND DON&#39;T SPEAK A WORD OF FRENCH. I TELL MYSELF THAT THIS WAS A DELIBERATE DEVICE TO PROTECT MY PERSONAL SPACE BUT I SUSPECT THAT I WAS JUST PROBABLY DUMBER THAN I THOUGHT.&nbsp; DO YOU DESIGN FOR ANYONE OR ANYTHING? IS THERE A VISION IN MIND OF WHERE YOU WANT YOUR GARMENTS TO LIVE?&nbsp; OF COURSE. BUT IF I TRIED DEFINING AND CATEGORIZING IT TO YOU, OR EVEN MYSELF, IT WOULD LOSE SOMETHING. TOO MUCH ANALYSIS DEFLATES THE SOUFFLE.&nbsp; DOES THE DESIGN PROCESS EVOLVE? EACH GARMENT HAS A DECONSTRUCTED, LIVED-IN FEEL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOUR PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THIS?&nbsp; MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS RESTRAINT AND MODESTY. MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS QUIET EXAGGERATION. MY THIRD THOUGHT WAS DISSIPATION.&nbsp; YOUR DESIGNS SEEM VERY FUNCTIONAL IN TERMS OF THE WAY THEY FIT THE BODY AND ARE CREATED FOR MOVEMENT. IS THIS SOMETHING YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OF WHEN DESIGINING, A PART OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY?&nbsp; I ADMIRE EXTREMELY CONSTRUCTED CLOTHES ARCHITECTURALLY, BUT PERSONALLY BALK A LITTLE AT DOING RESTRICTIVE THINGS TO PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE EXCESS FLESH SPILL OVER OR PUSH THINGS AROUND IN AN UNKIND WAY. OR BE SO CLINICALLY PERFECT THAT A HUMAN BEING WOULD ONLY DISTRACT FROM IT. I JUST THINK THAT EVERYONE&#39;S BODY LOOKS BETTER WHEN FABRIC JUST GLIDES OVER IT. WHEN YOU SEE HOW FORTUNY DID HIS COTHES AFTER THE BELLE EPOQUE CORSETS, IT&#39;S LIKE A WAVE OF FRESH AIR.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH STYLIST PANOS YIAPANIS? HOW DOES THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK?&nbsp; I THINK HE SAW SOMETHING THERE BEFORE THERE WAS ANYTHING REALLY THERE. HE SHOWED UP AT THE VERY BEGINNING AND JUST TOOK UP HIS POSITION NEXT TO ME AT THE FIRST SHOW AND THAT WAS THAT. HE&#39;S SO MUCH SMARTER THAN I AM. I&#39;M PRETTY SPECIFIC IN WHAT I WANT TO SAY IN A SHOW BUT HE THREADS EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND TELLS THE STORY IN A WAY THAT MAKES ME BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF AT ITS PRECISION AND POLISH. AND THEN HE&#39;S GONE UNTIL THE NEXT SHOW. I&#39;M SURE HE SHARES THIS KIND OF INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I&#39;VE DECIDED IN MY HEAD THAT I&#39;M HIS FAVORITE.&nbsp; RECENT TIMES HAVE SEEN THE FASHION WORLD HERALD A REVIVAL OF U.S. FASHION. YOU ARE OF COURSE FROM THE U.S. (THOUGH BASED IN PARIS), AND YOUR NAME IS AMONGST THOSE MENTIONED. ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS?&nbsp; FRANKLY, I DON&#39;T SEE A HALSTON OR A CALVIN KLEIN OR A GEOFFREY BEENE. AND I&#39;M NOT REFERRING JUST TO A DESIGN VISION, BUT A MYSTIQUE. MAYBE THAT&#39;S BECAUSE THERE&#39;S JUST SO SO MANY DESIGNERS AND DESIGNER INFORMATION NOW THAT IT&#39;S HARD TO SEE THROUGH THE CLUTTER. MAYBE I&#39;M JUST NOT LOOKING AS CAREFULLY AS I USED TO. MAYBE I JUST DON&#39;T KNOW MY ASS FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND.&nbsp; YOU&#39;VE BEEN COMPARED WITH NUMEROUS DESIGNERS, THOUGH I IMAGINE THIS IS AN EFFORT MAINLY BY FASHION WRITERS TRYING TO BEST DESCRIBE YOUR UNIQUE AESTHETIC. DID YOU FIND ANY GENUINE INFLUENCE FROM THE LIKES OF MARTIN MARGIELA, ANNE DEMEULEMEESTER, STEPHEN SPROUSE? THERE ARE SMALL ASPECTS OF YOUR WORK WHICH COULD BE COMPARED TO THESE ICONIC DESIGNERS, BUT BY NO MEANS IS THERE ANY OBVIOUS INFLUENCE.&nbsp; WELL, BEFORE I WAS A DESIGNER, I WAS A FAN OF THOSE DESIGNERS YOU MENTIONED AND MORE. OF COURSE I WAS INFLUENCED BY THEM. THEY MADE ME POSSIBLE. WE ALL LISTENED TO THE SAME BANDS AND WERE INTERESTED IN THE SAME ARTISTS AND THERE&#39;S A MILLION VERSIONS OF ALL OF US THAT ARE PROBABLY JUST AS GOOD. BUT SOMEWHERE, WE HOOKED UP WITH A TEAM THAT BALANCED US OUT AND GOT US TO A CLEAR SPOT WHERE WE COULD SHINE A LITTLE. AND FINDING THAT TEAM BALANCE IS A DELICATE, MYSTERIOUS THING THAT DOESN&#39;T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.&nbsp; TELL US ABOUT DRKSHDW. HOW DID THIS LINE COME ABOUT AND WHAT IS ITS PHILOSOPHY?&nbsp; DRKSHDW IS VERY LEATHER BAR DESIGNED BY EILEEN GREY. WITH A MURAL BY ANSELM KIEFER. AND MUSIC BY LED ZEPPELIN REMIXED BY AUTECHRE.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE OPINIONS OF HOW A MAN SHOULD DRESS?&nbsp; NONE WHATSOEVER. I OFFER SOME OPTIONS BUT TRY NOT TO LET MYSELF THINK I CAN MAKE ANY PROCLAMATIONS. FOR MYSELF, I&#39;M NOT REALLY INTO CLOTHES. I JUST HAVE MULTIPLES OF ONE OUTFIT. I LIKE A UNIFORM.&nbsp; YOU ARE A BIG ART FAN. CAN YOU TELL US SOME OF YOUR FAVOURITE ARTISTS?&nbsp; BRANCUSI BEUYS IRWIN COLLECTIVE ANDREI MOLODKIN PERRINO AND ABOUT ELEVENTY BILLION MORE. WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE DO YOU HOPE YOUR CUSTOMER HAS WHEN THEY ENTER YOUR STORES? I WANT THEM TO FEEL MY CONVICTION. I WANT THEM TO FEEL A HARDCORE COMMITMENT FROM ME.&nbsp; YOU HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON, NUMEROUS COLLECTIONS, STORES AND SO MUCH MORE. WHEN YOU GET TIME AWAY FROM THE WORKROOM, WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVOURITE PASTIMES?&nbsp; SWIMMING AND READING IN THE SUN, WITH MONTSERRAT CABALLE ON THE IPOD AND A VERY DISTANT DEADLINE. I&#39;VE LOOKED AROUND AND HAVEN&#39;T FOUND ANYTHING THAT MAKES ME AS HAPPY.&nbsp; WHILE I&#39;M SURE EVERYONE IS SICK OF THIS QUESTION BY NOW, I&#39;M KEEN TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THE RECESSION MAY AFFECT THE FASHION WORLD?&nbsp; I&#39;M SURE IT WILL BE AS REFRESHING AS A SPRING CLEANING.

SARAH MOWER MEETS RICK OWENS, THE MAN WHO REINVENTED A CLASSIC.&nbsp; EVEN IN AN INDUSTRY THAT LIONISES FREAKS&mdash;KARL LAGERFELD, JOHN GALLIANO, ANNA PIAGGI, ISABELLA BLOW, GARETH PUGH AND SO ON&mdash;RICK OWENS AND HIS WIFE MICHELE LAMY HAVE TO RANK AS ONE OF FASHION&#39;S MOST ALARMING SIGHTS. PASS THEM IN THE STREET&mdash;OWENS WITH HIS LA GYM-BODY AND ROD-STRAIGHT GOTH HAIR, LAMY WITH HER GOLD TEETH, TATTOOS, HENNA&#39;D LOCKS AND RING-ARMOURED FINGERS&mdash;AND YOU COULD EASILY TAKE THEM FOR TYPES WHO (AT THE LEAST) NEVER GET OUT OF BED BEFORE MIDDAY. YOU MIGHT ALSO WONDER WHAT A PAIR LIKE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DOING SLOUCHING ACROSS THE EXTREMELY HAUTE BOURGEOIS PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON IN PARIS, OR LATELY AROUND MAYFAIR IN LONDON. BUT IT&#39;S SIMPLE: ON THE STRENGTH OF AN AMAZING CRINKLED LEATHER JACKET AND A BUNDLE OF DUN-COLOURED, WASHED-OUT STRETCHY THINGS, RICK OWENS, SPURRED ON BY HIS WIFE, HAS MADE HIMSELF INTO ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY LOVED, BIGGEST-SELLING DESIGNERS TO HAVE EMERGED THIS DECADE.&nbsp; AND THAT EXPLAINS WHAT THE MAN IS DOING HANGING OUT IN THE LATEST OUTPOST OF HIS GROWING EMPIRE, A LARGE TWO-STOREY SHOP AT 64 SOUTH AUDLEY STREET, ONE OF THE POSHEST ADDRESSES POSSIBLE FOR ANY FASHION STORE IN LONDON. OWENS, IN HIS TYPICAL LAID-BACK MANNER, HASN&#39;T MADE ANY KIND OF A NOISE ABOUT OPENING, BUT HAS NONCHALANTLY TEXTED THAT HE&#39;S COMING OVER FROM PARIS, WHERE HE AND MICHELE LIVE, TO &quot;DUST THE SHELVES.&quot; HILARIOUSLY, THE SHOP IS RIGHT IN THE HEART OF ESTABLISHMENT LONDON, SO NOW, AS THE CLIENTELE ROLLS OUT OF HARRY&#39;S BAR OR SAUNTERS ALONG AFTER PERUSING THE GUNS AT PURDEY&#39;S, THEY WILL BE GREETED BY THE SIGHT OF A LIFE-SIZED REPLICA OF OWENS&#39;S HEAD, LYING ON THE TOP OF A CORINTHIAN COLUMN AS IF IT&#39;S BEEN GUILLOTINED. HE TELLS ME HE HAD IT SPECIALLY MADE BY A SCULPTOR WHO MAKES WAXWORKS FOR MADAME TUSSAUDS, ASSURING ME: &quot;IT&#39;S CORRECT TO THE LAST NOSE HAIR.&quot; WITH A SHRUG THAT SENDS THE BLANKET-LIKE WRAP TOP HE&#39;S WEARING FLYING OFF ONE MUSCLED SHOULDER, HE ADDS: &quot;IT MAKES ME THINK OF OSCAR WILDE, BEING AROUND HERE. I LOVE &quot;SALOME.&quot; IT&#39;S KINDA A COMPLIMENT TO WHERE WE ARE.&quot; A 47-YEAR-OLD SMALL-TOWN ART-SCHOOL DROPOUT FROM PORTERVILLE, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, OWENS SPEAKS IN A GENTLE, THOUGHTFUL DRAWL, SAYING THINGS WHICH ARE SHOCKING OR DOWNRIGHT FUNNY WITHOUT A FLICKER OF AN EXPRESSION CROSSING HIS FACE. REFERENCES SPILL OUT OF HIM: KISS, WAGNER, RICHARD STRAUSS, ALICE COOPER, PROUST, BRANCUSI, PIERRE LOTI, GUSTAV MOREAU&mdash;AN IMAGINATION WEIRDLY WIRED AROUND THE FORMATIVE INFLUENCES OF &#39;70S UNDERGROUND POP CULTURE AND FIN-DE-SIECLE ART. IT SHOWS IN THE CLOTHES, A SUBTLE MIX OF ROCK UNDERTONES, GRUNGE AND COUTURE-LIKE SOPHISTICATION. THE RAILS ARE HUNG WITH THE SUMMER COLLECTION&mdash;OFF-BLACK, TEXTURED PIECES WITH DROOPY ASYMMETRIES AND SCULPTURED PEARL-GREY TAILORING WITH KNOT-TIED BELTS AND LITTLE FINS JUTTING FROM SLEEVES. AMONG THEM THERE ARE MANY ADAPTATIONS OF THE WASHED-LEATHER JACKETS WITH THE STRETCHY RIB-SLEEVE INSERTS THAT MADE HIS NAME, TOO. THEY&#39;RE NEW, BUT NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE PIECES HE FIRST STARTED MAKING (HE THINKS) 13 YEARS AGO IN L.A., JACKETS THAT ARE NOW COLLECTED AND COVETED BY TWO GENERATIONS. ON THE ONE HAND OWENS HAS ROCK&#39;N&#39;ROLL 40- AND 50-YEAR-OLDS LOVING HIM FOR GIVING THEM A WAY TO PRESERVE THEIR COOL, AND ON THE OTHER, THEIR CHILDREN, WHO IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE COME TO A TASTE FOR DARK, SLOUCHY, HIPSTER STUFF UNDER THEIR OWN STEAM. THAT THE TWO MARKETS CAN LIVE ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT PUTTING EACH OTHER OFF IS ONE REASON BEHIND OWENS&#39;S STEADILY GROWING SUCCESS, A POPULARITY VISIBLY REGISTERED IN THE RAMPANT COPYING OF HIS LOOK ALL OVER THE WORLD. DOES HE CARE? &quot;NO-OO,&quot; HE SAYS SOFTLY. &quot;I GUESS IT&#39;S A COMPLIMENT.&quot; HE CAN PROBABLY AFFORD TO SOUND CONFIDENT ABOUT IT, TOO, BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES HE&#39;S EVOLVED ARE UNIQUE TO HIM. &quot;I REMEMBER GOING TO VISIT HIS STUDIO IN LA WAY BACK BEFORE HE SHOWED,&quot; RECALLS ED BURSTELL, LIBERTY&#39;S BUYING DIRECTOR, WHO BOUGHT OWENS FOR HENRI BENDEL IN NEW YORK, &quot;AND SAW HE HAD ALL THE DRESS FORMS HANGING FROM THE CEILING SO HE COULD FIT EVERYTHING EXACTLY. THE CLOTHES HAVE ZERO HANGER APPEAL, BUT ON THE BODY THEY BECOME INCREDIBLE. THEY FLATTER EVERYBODY.&quot; OWENS IS GENEROUS WITH THE TECHNICAL EXPLANATION: &quot;ALL OF THE SLEEVES ARE LONG, WITH A SMALL SHOULDER. THAT ALWAYS MAKES YOU LOOK SKINNIER. AND IF YOU HAVE AN INDENTATION IN THE LOWER BACK, IT KIND OF MAKES YOUR ASS PERKIER. A BACK PEPLUM IS ALWAYS GOOD.&quot; THE WHOLE IDEA, AS HE TELLS IT, WAS &quot;TO DO OLD HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR, BUT IN A RIPPED-T-SHIRT WAY. BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIES, BUT DONE IN LEATHER AND T-SHIRTING. I ALWAYS RESENTED HOW HIGH FASHION WAS SO UNAPPROACHABLE AND NOT FOR EVERYDAY. I THOUGHT: IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO DO IT, LIVE IT. I WASHED EVERYTHING KIND OF GREY SO YOU COULD WEAR A BIAS SKIRT WITH A TRAIN IN THE MORNING.&quot; IT ALL CAME ABOUT THROUGH WANTING TO DO STUFF THAT PASSED MUSTER WITH MICHELE. &quot;HE&#39;S ENTRANCED BY HER,&quot; SAYS HIS STYLIST PANOS YIAPANIS. &quot;THEY&#39;RE LIKE TWO GOOFY TEENAGERS TOGETHER.&quot; LAMY, WHO IS FRENCH AND 17 YEARS OWENS&#39;S SENIOR, HIRED HIM AS A PATTERN CUTTER WHEN SHE WAS BRIEFLY A DESIGNER HERSELF IN L.A. IN THE LATE &#39;80S BEFORE GOING ON TO RUN A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT-NIGHTCLUB, LES DEUX CAFES. OWENS CREDITS HER WITH STRAIGHTENING HIM OUT TOO: &quot;I WAS DRINKING AND DOING DRUGS, AND SHE MADE ME GO TO THE GYM.&quot; AT ONE POINT IN THE EARLY &#39;90S, THEY WERE BROKE AND LIVING AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT. &quot;SO I DESIGNED THE FIRST COLLECTION IN THAT BEDROOM. LONG BIAS-CUT SKIRTS, JACKETS WITH RIB SLEEVES. I REMEMBER LETTING THEM LIE AROUND TO SEE IF MICHELE WOULD PICK THEM UP, THEN I&#39;D KNOW THEY WERE OK. I BOUGHT THE FABRIC FROM A DEALER IN REMNANTS, AND LEATHER FIVE HIDES AT A TIME, WASHED THEM AND DYED THEM. THEN DROVE THEM IN TRUCKS TO STORES MYSELF.&quot; ALMOST IDENTICAL PIECES ARE STILL IN THE STORE NOW. EVENTUALLY OWENS WAS GENERATING SUCH A BUZZ FROM RETAILERS THAT ANNA WINTOUR PERSUADED HIM TO SHOW IN NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2001. IN 2004 HE AND LAMY TRANSPLANTED THEMSELVES TO PARIS, SHE MANAGED TO RENT THE FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS IN THE PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON (THEIR GRAND LIVE-IN STUDIO ON FIVE FLOORS), AND THE BUSINESS HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY EVER SINCE. NOW, EVERY SHOW-SEASON, A SECTION OF HIS FRONT ROW IS RIVETING TO BEHOLD, AS COMPLETE A PICTURE OF THE WORLD OF RICK AS THE CLOTHES ON HIS RUNWAY. THERE&#39;S HIS FATHER JOHN, &quot;A STUDIOUS AND GENTLE MAN, WHO COLLECTS GUNS&quot; AND HIS MEXICAN MOTHER CONNIE, A &quot;NORMAL&quot; AMERICAN ELDERLY COUPLE SITTING EASILY ALONGSIDE LAMY, HER GROWN-UP DAUGHTER SCARLETT, GARETH PUGH (WHO&#39;S BECOME LAMY&#39;S PROTEGE) AND AN ASSORTED POSSE OF WHITE-FACED, BLACK-LIPPED FRIENDS. AS A FRONT-ROW SPECTACLE, THEY MAY BE THE MUNSTERS OF PARIS, BUT IN THEIR OWN ECCENTRIC, OUT-THERE WAY THEY&#39;RE ALSO AS CLOSE TO A PICTURE OF SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS AS CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN FASHION.

WHAT WERE ITS CONNOTATIONS FOR YOU?&nbsp; OBVIOUSLY MANY PEOPLE GO BACK TO BRANDO, BUT THERE&rsquo;S SO MUCH MORE FROM SUBCULTURE AND COSTUME HISTORY. I STARTED OUT WITH FETISH GLAMAZONS FROM ERIC STANTON ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENDED UP IN LEATHER BARS. SERIOUSLY. ALTHOUGH IT DIDN&#39;T REALLY GIVE ME A BONER, I LOVED THE THEATRICAL MENACE OF IT.&nbsp; COULD YOU THINK OF A FEW IMAGES THAT STICK IN THE MIND AND INSPIRE WHEN YOU WORK IN LEATHER? PERHAPS FROM MUSIC AND FILM?&nbsp; PORN STAR PETER BERLIN, KISS, TURA SATANA FROM RUSS MEYER MOVIES. I COMBINED THAT CAMP FETISHISM WITH THE MINIMAL LANGUOR OF MADAME GRES AND MARIANO FORTUNY AND MADE MY LEATHER DRAPE.&nbsp; TAILORING IN LEATHER WOULD SEEM A DIAMETRIC OPPOSITE FROM THE BULK OF THE MORE FLUID/DRAPED PIECES YOU DO. WHAT ARE THE KEY CHALLENGES OF WORKING IN LEATHER? HOW DO YOU GET THE DISTINCTIVE &lsquo;WASHED&rsquo; PATINA AND TEXTURE WITH SO MANY OF YOUR GARMENTS? AND WHY IS TEXTURE SO IMPORTANT? SOMETHING LIKE LEWIS LEATHERS COMES ROCK HARD AND NEEDS MONTHS OF WEARING IN.&nbsp; DO YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD GIVE YOU MY RECIPE?

THEY WERE VERY SWEET ABOUT IT BUT JUST FELT THAT THE PRODUCTION WOULD BE TOO DIFFICULT AND RELEASED ME FROM OUR CONTRACT. I THINK THE COLLABORATION THING JUST ISN&#39;T FOR ME.&nbsp; BEFORE KNOWING YOU WANTED TO BE A FASHION DESIGNER, WHAT WAS THE BIG PLAN? WERE YOU ALWAYS INTERESTED IN THE CREATIVE SIDE?&nbsp; I WANTED TO BE JOSEPH BEUYS AND MARK ROTHKO AND FRANCIS BACON AND JULIAN SCHNABEL. SO I WENT TO ART SCHOOL BUT DROPPED OUT. IT WAS JUST TOO DAUNTING, AND A FAILURE WOULD BE TOO PERSONAL. SO I WENT INTO FASHION. A FAILURE IN FASHION CAN BE BLAMED ON A LOT OF FACTORS OTHER THAN YOURSELF.&nbsp; WHAT INTERESTED YOU CULTURALLY, THEN?&nbsp; MY PARENTS HAD A BIG LIBRARY AND DIDN&#39;T ALLOW A TELEVISION IN THE HOUSE SO I GREW UP ON HUYSMANS, PIERRE LOTI, COLETTE AND WAGNER AND DEBUSSY. BEING AN ONLY CHILD AND A LONER, THIS WAS PRETTY GREAT, ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I DIDN&#39;T APPRECIATE IT AT THE TIME. AND OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE I HAD KISS AND ALICE COOPER. I THINK WE CAN ALL SEE HOW MY CHARACTER WAS ESTABLISHED. NEVER IN MY IMAGINATION DID I THINK I&#39;D LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS I&#39;D READ ABOUT.&nbsp; AND THE MOMENT OF CLARITY? WAS THERE ANY PARTICULAR EPIPHANY?&nbsp; THIERRY MUGLER&#39;S METROPOLIS COLLECTION.&nbsp; WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT THIS TIME?&nbsp; ACTUALLY, I GOOGLED AND IT WAS AROUND 1977! I WAS 15! I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW A 15-YEAR-OLD IN A SMALL TOWN GOT AHOLD OF FRENCH VOGUE.&nbsp; AND I REMEMBER SEEING THE BOWIE &quot;DIAMOND DOGS&quot; ALBUM COVER IN THE SALES BIN AT THE KMART IN MY LITTLE TOWN. I FELT A SECRET I DIDN&#39;T EVEN KNOW I HAD HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND EXPOSED. IT MADE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE TIME.&nbsp; PEOPLE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE NAMES YOU GIVE EACH COLLECTION. &quot;CREATCH&quot; MADE ME TAKE NOTICE. AND ALSO THE SWING TAGS THAT ANNOUNCE THEM. ARE YOU AWARE THAT (LESS AFFLUENT) FANS LIKE TO DETACH THOSE RO TAGS OFF THE GARMENTS IN STORES! MUST BE A BIT LIKE SNAPPING THE MERCEDES EMBLEM OFF THE BONNET OF SOMEONE&#39;S CAR. A TROPHY?&nbsp; THAT&#39;S ONE OF THE NICEST THINGS ANYONE&#39;S EVER TOLD ME. THAT MEANS SOMEONE FEELS THE MAGIC I USED TO FEEL ABOUT DESIGNERS. WOW. IT WORKED.&nbsp; YOUR DESIGNS ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED AS GOTHIC, OR GOTH-INFLUENCED. HOW DOES THIS RESONATE WITH YOU? THERE WAS THAT WONDERFUL QUOTE IN VALERIE STEELE&#39;S BOOK LAST FALL, &ldquo;GOTHIC: DARK GLAMOUR.&rdquo; JOURNALISTS, ESPECIALLY FASHION, CAN OFTEN BE LAZY. ARE THEY KEEPING UP WITH YOU? WHAT DO YOU FEEL COULD BE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR DESIGN AESTHETIC?&nbsp; I DON&#39;T MIND. JOURNALISTS HAVE TO SUMMARIZE, AND COMPARED TO MOST DESIGNERS, I CAN SEE WHAT THEY MEAN. IT&#39;S GOING TO TURN A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF AND RESTRICT ME TO A NICHE, BUT THAT&#39;S PROBABLY MY OWN FAULT. I WISH SOMEONE HAD COME UP WITH &ldquo;ASTROGOTH.&rdquo; I GUESS I&#39;LL JUST HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF.&nbsp; GOTH SOUNDS A LITTLE PUERILE, BUT I HAVE FAITH THAT PEOPLE DETECT A LITTLE MORE. OTHERWISE, I DON&#39;T THINK I&#39;D HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR.&nbsp; YOUR APPROACH TO SEXUALITY IN FASHION SUGGESTS A DEEPER LEVEL OF THOUGHT THAN, SAY, EXPOSING AN AREA OF THE TORSO SIMPLY FOR VISUAL IMPACT. IT&#39;S A DIFFERENT BODY CONSCIOUSNESS. THERE ARE DARKER, MORE EXTREME REFERENCES AT PLAY HERE. THIS HAS BEEN CREDITED IN PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS TO YOUR EARLIER INTERESTS IN SEX CLUBS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ELABORATE FURTHER ON THIS PERIOD OF TIME? HOW IT INFLUENCED THE DESIGNS, FOR EXAMPLE.&nbsp; I THINK I SATISFIED A LOT OF MY APPETITES AND I THINK MY CLOTHES PROBABLY REFLECT THAT. THEY&#39;RE NOT CLOTHES TO GO OUT AND GET LAID. BUT THEY&#39;RE CLOTHES FOR A BODY THAT&#39;S USED TO CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PLEASURE AND NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT IT ANYMORE.&nbsp; WHEN WE MET IN NEW YORK LAST YEAR, YOU MADE A CHARMING ALLUSION TO GARETH PUGH AS THE PRODIGAL SON, MICHELE AS STRICT MATRIARCH, AND YOU AS THE DOTING FATHER.&nbsp; ACTUALLY, MICHELE IS THE NURTURING MOTHER AND I&#39;M THE DISTANT, CRITICAL FATHER. I THINK WE UNDERSTIMATED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GARETH COUPLED WITH THE GROWTH RATE OF THE RICK OWENS BUSINESS. WE ALL HAVE OUR HANDS PRETTY FULL RIGHT NOW.&nbsp; IS THERE ANYONE YOU CARE TO MENTION WHOM, YOU FEEL, PLACED YOUR DESIGNS INTO THE PUBLIC EYE? IF YOU PREFER NOT TO NAME ANYONE SPECIFICALLY, PERHAPS SOME INSIGHT DETAILING HOW HOLLYWOOD DISCOVERED YOU, AND WHAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT. WAS THIS BEFORE VOGUE INVITING YOU TO SHOW IN NEW YORK?&nbsp; I&#39;M MORE PLEASED WITH THE EDITORS THAT HAVE WORN THE CLOTHES: ANNA WINTOUR, CARINE ROITFELD, EMMANUELLE ALT, SALLY SINGER... THEY&#39;VE SEEN IT ALL, AND THAT&#39;S A REAL TEST PASSED. CELEBRITIES HAVE ONE OF EVERYTHING THAT&#39;S HANGING IN THE RIGHT STORES AND ARE PROBABLY GOING FOR A DIFFERENT EFFECT THAN I CAN PROVIDE. IT WAS MY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE STORES THAT I ADMIRED THAT WERE WHAT I CONCENTRATED ON AT THE BEGINNING AND MADE THE DIFFERENCE. ANDRE LEON TALLEY CALLED ME UP AFTER SEEING A RICK OWENS WINDOW AT BENDEL&#39;S. HE&#39;D NEVER HEARD OF ME AND I&#39;D BEEN SELLING CLOTHES FOR YEARS.&nbsp; BACK IN APRIL, THE DESIGN OF THE LONDON STORE WAS DESCRIBED AS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS. HAS IT REACHED A MORE STABLE CONFIGURATION NOW? ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT LOOKS FOR THE TIME BEING?&nbsp; I HAD TO TEAR DOWN A FEW WALLS FROM THE FIRST DESIGN, BUT AM DEEPLY PLEASED WITH IT NOW. I HAD MY FURNITURE GUY GO AND STAY THERE FOR A MONTH TO HAND-APPLY THE CONCRETE TEXTURE TO THE WALLS. I WANTED IT TO LOOK LIKE A COMBO OF A BRUTALIST MONUMENT AND A CHEAP UNDERGROUND CAR PARK. IT STILL NEEDS A FEW WARM TOUCHES LIKE SOME MORE CASHMERE DRAPES AND SOME GOLD STOOLS BUT THEY&#39;RE ON THEIR WAY.&nbsp; FINALLY, HOW IS THE TOKYO STORE PROGRESSING?&nbsp; ROWAN, MY FURNITURE GUY, IS GOING THERE DIRECTLY AFTER HIS HOLIDAY TO FINISH THE WORK ON THE CONCRETE, AND THE WAX FIGURE OF MYSELF MORPHING INTO GODZILLA IS BEING SHIPPED FROM LONDON AT THE END OF THE MONTH!

HER DESIGNS EXPRESS A SENSIBILITY THAT IS &ldquo;ON THE DARKER SIDE,&rdquo; SHE ACKNOWLEDGED, THEIR SOMBER COLORS, CASCADING LAPELS AND DROOPY SHAPES SUGGESTING NOTHING SO MUCH AS A MIDNIGHT ROMP WITH MORTICIA ADDAMS. THEY ALSO BEAR MORE THAN A PASSING RESEMBLANCE TO THE DESIGNS OF RICK OWENS, A FELLOW CALIFORNIAN WHOSE BROODING AESTHETIC IS THE TALK OF THE RUNWAYS.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;VE BEEN TOLD IT&rsquo;S KIND OF COPYCAT,&rdquo; MS. YOGEV SAID OF HER WORK. &ldquo;THAT CAN BE KIND OF FRUSTRATING AT TIMES.&rdquo; BUT COMPARISONS TO MR. OWENS &ldquo;CAN ALSO BE USEFUL,&rdquo; SHE ADDED. &ldquo;ONCE YOU MENTION HIS NAME, EVERYONE IS AUTOMATICALLY DRAWN.&rdquo;&nbsp; HER AFFINITY FOR WASHED-OUT, GOTH-TINGED LEATHERS AND STRETCHED-OUT SHAPES IS UNDERSTANDABLE: MS. YOGEV, THE DESIGNER OF GRAI, BASED IN LOS ANGELES, APPRENTICED WITH MR. OWENS AT A FORMATIVE STAGE IN HER CAREER. BUT SHE IS FAR FROM THE ONLY FASHION MAKER INDEBTED TO THAT DESIGNER&rsquo;S PARTICULAR BRAND OF URBAN DECAY.&nbsp; IN RECENT MONTHS, A VERITABLE INDUSTRY HAS SPRUNG UP AROUND MR. OWENS, WHO MAY BE FASHION&rsquo;S MOST IMITATED DESIGNER. RIVAL HOUSES ARE RACING TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN DISTILLATIONS OF HIS ANGULAR FLAPS, ZIGZAGGING ZIPPERS, GOSSAMER T-SHIRTS AND BIKER JACKETS PLIANT AS SECOND SKINS. IN THE TRADITION OF GIORGIO ARMANI, VIVIENNE WESTWOOD AND TOM FORD, EACH OF WHOM AT ONE TIME PILOTED FASHION&rsquo;S CRUISER, MR. OWENS&rsquo;S IDEAS ARE ABSORBED OR COPIED OUTRIGHT IN COLLECTIONS AS DIVERSE AS THOSE OF ALEXANDER WANG AND RAG &amp; BONE, OR ON A MORE PATENTLY COMMERCIAL LEVEL, BY TOPSHOP AND AMERICAN APPAREL.&nbsp; &ldquo;HE HAS CERTAINLY CAPTURED THE MOMENT,&rdquo; SAID KATHRYN DEANE, PRESIDENT OF THE TOBE REPORT, A RETAIL NEWSLETTER. ONCE EVERY DECADE OR SO, SHE SAID, &ldquo;EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH, AND FOR NOW THAT WAVELENGTH IS RICK OWENS.&rdquo;&nbsp; MR. OWENS SEEMS TO SPEAK MOST PERSUASIVELY TO DESIGNERS ON THE CUTTING EDGE: ALEXA ADAMS AND FLORA GILL OF OHNE TITEL; HAIDER ACKERMANN, WHOSE FALL COLLECTION WAS DOMINATED BY SUPPLE DRAPED LEATHERS; GARETH PUGH IN LONDON; AND NICOLE AND MICHAEL COLOVOS OF HELMUT LANG, WHOSE SLANT-ZIPPER, FUNNEL-NECK JACKETS AND SHEEPSKIN AND LEATHER COATS, CUT AWAY TO REVEAL SOFTLY DRAPED UNDERLAYERS AND SCRUNCHED-UP LEGGINGS, UNMISTAKABLY ECHO THOSE OF MR. OWENS.&nbsp; THE COLOVOSES, WHO SAY THAT THEIR STYLE HAS BEEN SHAPED BY THE ANGULAR CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLEX LAYERING OF THE JAPANESE VANGUARD, AND BY THE GHOSTLY PALETTE OF PAINTERS LIKE MARLENE DUMAS, MAINTAIN THAT SUCH COMPARISONS ARE INEVITABLE. &ldquo;AT TIMES EVERYONE JUST SEEMS TO COME TOGETHER,&rdquo; NICOLE COLOVOS SAID. &ldquo;WE&rsquo;RE RESPONDING TO A FEELING THAT JUST GETS CHANNELED SOMEHOW.&rdquo; THAT &ldquo;FEELING&rdquo;&mdash;A CONFLUENCE OF ROCK STAR AND CRYPT CHIC&mdash;IS ONE MR. OWENS HAS BEEN PEDDLING FOR YEARS. SINCE FOUNDING HIS FASHION LABEL IN LOS ANGELES IN 1994, THE 47-YEAR-OLD DESIGNER HAS RARELY STRAYED FROM HIS SIGNATURE STYLE.&nbsp; &ldquo;HIS CLARITY OF VISION OVER TIME IS WHAT MAKES HIM SO COMPELLING NOW,&rdquo; SAID ED BURSTELL, THE BUYING DIRECTOR FOR LIBERTY OF LONDON, AND ONE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN MERCHANTS TO CHAMPION MR. OWENS, AT HENRI BENDEL IN NEW YORK. &ldquo;TODAY EVERYONE WANTS ACCESS TO HIS CLUB.&rdquo; MR. OWENS&rsquo;S EMERGENCE AS FASHION&rsquo;S CYNOSURE IS A PARADOX. HE WAS, AFTER ALL, LONG A SHADOWY FIGURE IN THE INDUSTRY, AN OUTSIDER BASED IN LOS ANGELES WHO SEEMED TO CULTIVATE A CREEPY AURA. IN AN E-MAIL MESSAGE, HE RESPONDED WITH TERSE RESIGNATION TO THE SUGGESTION THAT OTHERS WERE COPYING HIS DESIGNS. &ldquo;WHEN SOMETHING&rsquo;S IN THE AIR,&rdquo; HE WROTE, &ldquo;NO ONE CAN REALLY OWN IT.&rdquo; IF MR. OWENS EXERTS A STRONGER PULL THAN MOST, IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON THE 1980S, THE DECADE DOMINANT ON THE RUNWAYS OF LATE, IN FAVOR OF A READILY IDENTIFIABLE, FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH. &ldquo;RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING TO RECREATE A HERITAGE, HE IS TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING GENUINELY NEW,&rdquo; SAID ADAM BRYCE, THE PUBLISHER AND FOUNDER OF THE NEW ORDER, A DESIGN AND ARTS MAGAZINE. &ldquo;THERE IS A FUTURISTIC FEEL TO HIS ASYMMETRIC CUTS AND MONOTONES,&rdquo; MR. BRYCE ADDED, ONE THAT HAS PARALLELS IN CONTEMPORARY MUSIC AND GRAPHIC DESIGN. VALERIE STEELE, THE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM OF THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, NOTED THAT MR. OWENS HAS GIVEN THAT HOARY ARCHETYPE, THE BIKER JACKET, A NEW SHAPE AND CUT. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S NOT THE &rsquo;80S,&rdquo; SHE SAID. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S FRESH BLOOD, AND EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR THAT.&rdquo;&nbsp; SEXY BUT RESOLUTELY SOBER, THAT JACKET AND ITS COUNTLESS IMITATIONS STRIKE A CHORD WITH A PUBLIC INCREASINGLY RELUCTANT TO FLAUNT SHINY FABRICS AND SHOW-OFF LABELS. &ldquo;WE&rsquo;RE COMING OUT OF A PERIOD THAT WAS VERY FLAMBOYANT,&rdquo; SAID KARLO STEEL, A PARTNER IN ATELIER, A HIP MENSWEAR OUTPOST IN MANHATTAN. &ldquo;FASHION&rsquo;S PENDULUM IS SWINGING AWAY FROM THAT NOW IN A DIRECTION THAT IS A BIT ANTI-MATERIAL.&rdquo; THAT NEWLY TEMPERATE MOOD IS EVIDENT IN PIECES THAT SHOW SIGNS, HE SAID, &ldquo;OF EVERYDAY WEAR AND TEAR.&rdquo; THE INFLUENCE OF THAT WEATHERED STYLE EXTENDS AS FAR AS JAPAN, WHERE TREND-DRIVEN MENSWEAR HOUSES LIKE JULIUS AND DAMIR DOMA ARE WHIPPING UP THEIR OWN DUN-COLORED, SOMEWHAT AGGRESSIVE LOOKS.&nbsp; MR. STEEL, WHOSE STORE CARRIES BOTH JAPANESE LABELS, ARGUED THAT THE STYLE, FIRST ESPOUSED IN THE POST-RECESSIONARY EARLY &rsquo;90S BY DESIGNERS LIKE HELMUT LANG, MARTIN MARGIELA AND MR. OWENS HIMSELF, IS &ldquo;NOT SO MUCH COPIED AS ABSORBED INTO PEOPLES&rsquo; LINES.&rdquo; DESIGNERS INCORPORATE NOT JUST THE SEVERITY OF THOSE EARLIER CUTS AND SHAPES, BUT ALSO THEIR SOMBER MOODS AND HUES&mdash;&ldquo;ALL SHADES OF NON-COLOR,&rdquo; AS MR. STEEL PUT IT, &ldquo;FROM BLACK TO WHITE.&rdquo;&nbsp; THAT PALETTE HAS BEEN PICKED UP BY CALIFORNIA ACOLYTES LIKE RAQUEL ALLEGRA, WHOSE FILMY TANKS AND SWALLOWTAIL DRESSES ARE MADE FROM CAST-OFF PRISON GARB; AND MS. YOGEV, WHO THINKS OF HERSELF AS CHANNELING THE DESIGNER&rsquo;S EERIE SENSE OF MYSTERY. THAT SEEMING MENACE, THE OUTSIDER SENSIBILITY, HAS ATTRACTED THE POPULAR IMAGINATION, IN PART BECAUSE IT &ldquo;COMES FROM THE SAME PLACE AS OUR OBSESSIONS WITH VAMPIRES,&rdquo; SUGGESTED DAVID WOLFE, THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DONEGER GROUP, WHICH FORECASTS RETAIL TRENDS. MR. OWENS AND HIS ARTFULLY SINISTER ILK REPRESENT, HE SAID, &ldquo;THE KIND OF WORLD IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS BLEAK; IT&rsquo;S POST-CIVILIZATION.&rdquo; BUT ITS APPEAL IS SCARCELY LIMITED TO &ldquo;TRUE BLOOD&rdquo; OR &ldquo;DISTRICT 9&rdquo; DEVOTEES. OWENS JACKETS, WITH THEIR SHRUNKEN SLEEVES, RIBBED INSERTS, HIGH SHOULDERS AND TIGHT SILHOUETTE, HAVE FOUND FAVOR WITH ALL GENERATIONS. &ldquo;THERE IS SOMETHING LOUCHE AND SEXY BUT NOT CRASS OR OBVIOUS ABOUT HIS LOOK,&rdquo; MS. STEELE SAID. &ldquo;IF MARIANNE FAITHFULL WERE YOUNG, SHE&rsquo;D BE WEARING THIS KIND OF STUFF.&rdquo; SHE MIGHT WEAR IT EVEN NOW.&nbsp; MR. OWENS BEGAN TO CAPTIVATE A WIDER PUBLIC WHEN POP FIGURES LIKE THE OLSEN TWINS, RACHEL BILSON AND KANYE WEST BEGAN WEARING HIS DESIGNS. HIS WIDELY-KNOCKED-OFF BIKER JACKET IS STILL IN DEMAND AT THE OWENS NEW YORK SHOP ON HUDSON STREET, NEVER MIND THE $2,700 PRICE TAG.&nbsp; AS WITH ANY STYLE IN DEMAND, MERCHANTS ARE BEING BRIEFED TO &ldquo;GET THAT LOOK IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM, AND GET IT AT A PRICE,&rdquo; SAID HOWARD DAVIDOWITZ, WHO HEADS A NEW YORK RETAIL CONSULTING FIRM. &ldquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T IGNORE A POPULAR LOOK IF YOU WANT TO BE COMMERCIAL.&rdquo;&nbsp; SMALL WONDER, THEN, THAT OWENS CLONES ARE WELL REPRESENTED AT INFLUENTIAL STORES LIKE OPENING CEREMONY AND, MORE ACCESSIBLY, AT TOPSHOP, WHICH OFFERS SEVERAL ADAPTATIONS OF THE BIKER JACKET, AND AMERICAN APPAREL, WHICH BEGAN SELLING LAYER-ABLE INTERPRETATIONS OF MR. OWEN&rsquo;S TRADEMARK LONG, SEE-THROUGH T-SHIRTS AND TANKS EARLIER THIS SUMMER.&nbsp; ROLAND MOURET, A DESIGNER WHO FIRST MADE HIS MARK WITH HOURGLASS-SHAPE COCKTAIL DRESSES, DEPARTED FROM THAT SOIGNEE LOOK THIS SEASON WITH A FAUX OWENS BIKER LOOK. MARIA CORNEJO PARADED A HOODED VERSION ON HER RUNWAY; ROBERTO CAVALLI, CHARLOTTE RONSON, DIESEL BLACK GOLD AND RAG &amp; BONE EACH INTERPRETED THE LOOK, DOWN TO ITS TELLTALE SLANTING ZIPPERS. MR. OWENS HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGED HIS INFLUENCE, IF ONLY OBLIQUELY: &ldquo;SUFFICE TO SAY THAT IT&rsquo;S MOTIVATION FOR ME TO DO MY BEST TO MOVE FORWARD.&rdquo; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

NEUTRALS ALSO SUGGEST A STEADY CHARACTER TO ME. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF I COULD DO COLORS AS WONDERFULLY AND MADLY CHIC AS CHRISTIAN LACROIX, I WOULD.&nbsp; HAIR IS ALWAYS A BIG PART OF A RICK OWENS SHOW. WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON HAIR? WHAT GOES INTO THE BIRTH OF A RICK OWENS HAIRCUT?&nbsp; I LIKE A COMMITMENT WITH HAIR. LONG OR SHAVED. IF YOU&rsquo;RE NOT A NATURAL BEAUTY (AND WHO OF US IS?), EITHER ONE GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF GENTLE PIZAZZ.&nbsp; YOU RECENTLY OPENED YOU STORE IN LONDON. HOW DO FEEL ABOUT LONDON? WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR VIEW ON LONDON-BASED FASHION?&nbsp; LOVE LONDON. I LOVE THE POSTWAR MONUMENTS AND CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION, I LOVE THE KIDS IN THEIR TIGHT JEANS AND DROOPY JEANS AND CUTE HAIR. I LIKE IT WHEN BRITS GET BATTY: STEPHEN TENNANT, BARBARA CARTLAND, MARGARET RUTHERFORD. I LOVE GLAM ROCK, PUNK ROCK, PENELOPE TREE, THE PHENOMENON OF KATE MOSS.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;VE WORKED WITH GARETH PUGH, WHO SEEMS TO BE VERY INSPIRED BY YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS WORK? WHY DO LIKE HIM AS A DESIGNER?&nbsp; HE&rsquo;S A LOVELY GUY WITH A STEELY DETERMINATION TO CREATE WHETHER WE PAY ATTENTION TO HIM OR NOT. HE&rsquo;S VERY POLITE AND AT THE SAME TIME IS VIOLENTLY REJECTING CONFORMITY. I REALLY ENJOY THAT COMBINATION. VERY BRITISH.&nbsp; A MOULD OF YOUR BODY IS DISPLAYED IN YOUR PARIS STORE, AND YOUR HEAD IS EXHIBITED ON A PLATE AT YOUR LONDON STORE. WHAT&rsquo;S THE CONNOTATION OF THIS?&nbsp; I HAD ORIGINALLY COMMISIONED THE FULL FIGURE FOR MY HOUSE. IT WAS MY PERSONAL INTERPRETATION OF A MAN&rsquo;S PORTRAIT OVER THE FIREPLACE; AN EXPRESSION OF VANITY AND MORTALITY, THE IMPLICATION BEING THAT YOU&rsquo;RE CAPTURING THE PRIME OF YOUR LIFE AND HOW YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED. YOUR DECLINE IS IMPLICIT.&nbsp; BUT I GOT TIRED OF SEEING IT IN THE HOUSE EVERY DAY AND THOUGHT THAT THE PARIS STORE NEEDED A LITTLE SHOCK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;VE ALWAYS SAID THAT MY CLOTHES ARE MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY, AND I FEEL THAT THE FIGURES MIGHT REINFORCE THAT.&nbsp; YOU CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE REALMS OF ASYMMETRY. WHAT IS IT ABOUT ASYMMETRY THAT COMMUNICATES SO WELL WITH RICK OWENS?&nbsp; ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS IS &ldquo;AGAINST THE GRAIN&rdquo; BY J.K. HUYSMANS. I LIKE THAT IDEA, AND I LIKE HOW IT FITS IN WITH BIAS CUTTING AND WRAPPING ANGLES AROUND THE BODY.&nbsp; IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IT APPEARS THERE&rsquo;S BEEN A CLEARER SEPARATION IN THE GENDER SPECIFICATIONS BETWEEN YOUR WOMENSWEAR AND MENSWEAR. HAVE YOU CONSCIOUSLY STRIVED TO MAKE YOUR EXPRESSIONS LESS ASEXUAL OR UNISEX?&nbsp; UH, NO, I DON&rsquo;T THINK SO.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?&nbsp; YES, FROM 20 YEARS AGO. I HAVE A FLAMING SKULL ON A STAR ON MY LEFT ARM, AND A STAR ON MY RIGHT FOREARM. I WAS CONSCIOUS AT THE TIME OF GETTING THE DUMBEST, MOST ADOLESCENT TATTOO I COULD SO IT WOULDN&rsquo;T DATE. I&rsquo;M GLAD I DID. THEY WERE MEANT TO EXPRESS NIHILISM AND ABANDON, NOT SENTIMENTALITY OR SPIRITUALITY. I DON&rsquo;T SEE THEM ANYMORE.&nbsp; DRKSHDW HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR DOMAIN. WHAT ARE YOUR AMBITIONS FOR THE LINE?&nbsp; RECENTLY, I&rsquo;VE BEEN SEEING IT AS MORE LIKE WORKER-HEALTH-FITNESS UNIFORMS. I&rsquo;M WORKING ON CUSTOM ARTISINAL DENIMS AS WELL.&nbsp; DESCRIBE YOUR FIRST LADY, MICHELE LAMY.&nbsp; EMBRACING, GENEROUS, HOT-HEADED, MAGIC, IMPETUOUS, IMPERIOUS, SOFT, SMOKE, MIRRORS AND VEILS.&nbsp; OVER THE PAST DECADE YOU HAVE GONE FROM BEING A FASHION DESIGNER TO PERSONALITY/ICON. WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON FASHION CELEBRITY? IN YEARS TO COME, DO YOU SEE YOURSELF BECOMING A LAGERFELD-LIKE, SUPERHUMAN TYPE OF CHARACTER?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M FLATTERED THAT YOU THINK I COULD MAINTAIN THAT KIND OF INTEREST. I DON&rsquo;T THINK I HAVE THAT MUCH ENERGY.&nbsp; YOU SEEM TO BE SO RELAXED IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDUSTRY LIKE?&nbsp; I WOULD SAY &ldquo;DISTANT&rdquo; BUT THAT&rsquo;S ACTUALLY WHAT EVERYBODY I&rsquo;VE EVER MET IN THE BUSINESS SAYS.&nbsp; WHICH DESIGNERS DO YOU CURRENTLY PAY ATTENTION TO? WHO DO YOU ADMIRE?&nbsp; IT WOULD BE A LONG LIST. I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT EVERYBODY&#39;S GOING TO SHOW NEXT. I&rsquo;M A BIG FASHION FAN.&nbsp; THIS WEEK, EVERYBODY&rsquo;S WEIGHING IN ON THE PASSING OF MICHAEL JACKSON AND HIS INFLUENCE ON FASHION. WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON HIS STYLE LEGACY?

NOW I WONDER IF IT DOESN&#39;T TAKE MORE BALLS TO BE A DESIGNER. CONSIDER THIS: A DESIGNER MUST PRESENT COLLECTIONS 4 TIMES A YEAR AND BE JUDGED ON THE BASIS OF RELEVANCE TO THE MOMENT AND COMMERCIAL VIABILITY. AND BY RELEVANT, I MEAN SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN&#39;T EXPLAIN, BUT ELICITS AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE IN ENOUGH PEOPLE TO KEEP YOU IN BUSINESS. TO MY EYE, A LOT OF CONTEMPORARY ART I&#39;M SEEING THESE DAYS SEEMS TO RELY ON ARCH SOCIAL COMMENTARY, SARCASM OR CONFRONTATION. I MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTIMIDATED IN MY YOUTH BY THE CEREMONY AND WORSHIPFUL PACE IN THE ART WORLD BUT I&#39;M A BIT SKEPTICAL NOW. BUT I COULD JUST BE BLOWING SMOKE OUT MY ASS. I USED TO DISAPPROVE OF JEFF KOONS, BUT I JUST SAW HIS SHOW IN LONDON AND FELL IN LOVE. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. SO I&#39;M PROBABLY JUST FULL OF S IT.&nbsp; DO YOU CONSIDER FASHION LIKE A GAME?&nbsp; WELL, I SUPPOSE I CONSIDER LIFE A GAME.&nbsp; DOES FASHION HAVE RULES OR LAWS?&nbsp; YES. THE RULES ARE TO LAUGH AT THE RULES.&nbsp; YOUR IMAGINATION MIXES GLAMOUR/POST-GOTHIC AND GRUNGE STYLE. ARE YOU ALSO INSPIRED BY THE STREETS?&nbsp; WELL, I&#39;M NOT ON THE STREETS THE WAY I USED TO BE. BUT MAYBE THE FIRST THIRD OF MY LIFE WAS ABOUT EXPERIMENTATION, AND THIS THIRD IS ABOUT ANALYZING AND EDITING AND EXPRESSING THOSE SOUVENIRS. I&#39;M RESERVING THE LAST THIRD FOR COMPLETE DISSIPATION.&nbsp; WHAT HAS MISERY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE STREETS TAUGHT YOU?&nbsp; GRATITUDE.&nbsp; WHAT HAS THE GLAMOUROUS SIDE TAUGHT YOU?&nbsp; THE PLEASURE OF BEAUTY IS ONE OF LIFE&#39;S GREATEST REWARDS.&nbsp; YOU MUST TRAVEL A LOT. ESPECIALLY BETWEEN L.A. AND PARIS, WE GUESS. HOW DO THOSE 2 CITIES INSPIRE YOU?&nbsp; I HAVEN&#39;T BEEN TO L.A. FOR 7 YEARS. I&#39;VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE ITS MEMORY TO A FEELING OF INTERMINABLE INDESTRUCTIBILITY IN THE SUN. OF COURSE, I&#39;M WRONG.&nbsp; IS YOUR INSPIRATION ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WEAR EVERY DAY, OR WHAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR DREAMS?&nbsp; I WANTED TO CORRUPT WHAT PEOPLE WORE EVERY DAY INSTEAD OF CREATING DRAMATIC CLOTHES FOR JUST A MOMENT OF DISPLAY. I WANTED TO TALK TO THAT PART IN ALL OF US THAT WONDERS WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE TO JUST LET GO, JUST LET EVERYTHING FALL APART.&nbsp; WHAT WORKS OF MUSIC AND MOVIES HAVE INFLUENCED YOU?&nbsp; 1. THE IDIOT- IGGY POP 2. SALOME - RICHARD STRAUSS 3. PINK FLAMINGOS - JOHN WATERS 4. CLEOPATRA - CECIL B. DEMILLE YOU ARE CONSIDERED AN AVANT-GARDE PERSON. WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS?&nbsp; I&#39;M NOT DOING ANYTHING NEW. I&#39;M JUST REARRANGING CODES THAT OUR GENERATION RECOGNIZES AND RELATES TO. BUT I&#39;M TRYING TO DO IT IN A NO-BULLS IT WAY. SOMETIMES I HIT, SOMETIMES I MISS.&nbsp; YOU DESIGNED FURS FOR REVILLON BUT, SINCE ENDING THAT, YOU ARE NOT SHOWING MUCH FUR IN YOUR COLLECTIONS.&nbsp; I DON&#39;T THINK YOU KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT ME. I PUT FUR IN EVERY FALL COLLECTION, MEN&#39;S AND WOMEN&#39;S. AND I HAVE A LABEL THAT&#39;S EXCLUSIVELY FUR, CALLED PALAIS ROYAL, THAT I PRODUCE IN A FUR ATELIER IN MY HOUSE.&nbsp; YOU DON&rsquo;T CREATE A LOT OF ACCESSORIES FOR MEN, EVEN THOUGH OTHER DESIGNERS DO.&nbsp; UH, I INVITE YOU TO GO TO MY STORES.&nbsp; HOW COULD YOU DESCRIBE RICK OWENS&rsquo;S MENS?&nbsp; EILEEN GREY AND JOSEPH BEUYS OPEN A LEATHER BAR TOGETHER AND INVITE KISS OVER.&nbsp; YOU DON&rsquo;T USE COLORS. WHEN YOU USE WHITE, IT&rsquo;S ALWAYS &ldquo;DARKER&rdquo; AND &ldquo;COLDER&rdquo; THAN YOUR BLACK CLOTHES. YOUR BLACK CREATIONS ARE MORE GENEROUS IN THE DESIGN. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS CHOICE?&nbsp; I&#39;VE ALWAYS ENJOYED A HARD, UNSENTIMENTAL CHIC BORDERING ON THE PERVERSE. MAYBE BECAUSE I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR INDULGING IN EMOTION, INCLUDING MY OWN. BUT I KNOW THAT SUPPRESSED EMOTION COMES THROUGH IN MY CLOTHES. AND I&#39;M FINE WITH THAT. I&#39;M FINE WITH BEING TRANSPARENT. I&#39;M FINE WITH ADMITTING THAT I&#39;M A HYPOCRITICAL FOOL. WE ALL ARE.&nbsp; WHAT WILL FASHION LOOK LIKE IN 2030? WHAT WILL RICK OWENS CLOTHES LOOK LIKE?&nbsp; I WOULDN&#39;T PRESUME TO PREDICT. IT HAS TO RELATE TO THE MOMENT.&nbsp; ANY LAST WORDS TO OUR READERS?&nbsp; PLEASE KEEP AN OPEN HEART, AND I WISH EVERYONE THE BEST.

WHAT DO YOU THINK WE WILL BE WEARING IN THE YEAR 2040?&nbsp; FROM WHAT I SEE, WE&#39;VE GONE THROUGH 2 PHASES: GRUNGE BROUGHT US A FEAR OF LOOKING TOO POLISHED, SO WE OVERACTED WITH LOOKING EXTREMELY CARELESS. THEN, WITH ACCELERATED COMMUNICATION LIKE THE INTERNET, SO MANY MORE OPTIONS BECAME AVAILABLE. WE DEVELOPED AN INDISCRIMINATE TREASURE-BOX LOOK. WE VERY WELL MAY BE HEADED TO A &#39;40S-LOOKING ERA, A PERIOD OF VERY CALCULATED COMBINATIONS; MORE CAREFULLY EDITED LOOKS WITH MORE EXTREMELY ACCESSORIZED EFFECTS. I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.

AND DO YOU THINK YOUR UPBRINGING HAS INFLUENCED YOUR STYLE? IF SO, HOW?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M A CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLICH&Eacute;. I GREW UP AN ONLY CHILD IN A SMALL CONSERVATIVE TOWN. MY PARENTS DIDN&rsquo;T ALLOW A TV IN THE HOUSE, BUT HAD A BIG LIBRARY AND CLASSICAL MUSIC COLLECTION. I GREW UP READING HUYSMANS, COLETTE, LOTI, AND LISTENING TO DEBUSSY, WAGNER AND MAHLER. OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE, I GRAVITATED TOWARDS HEAVY METAL LIKE KISS AND ALICE COOPER. I COULDN&rsquo;T WAIT TO LEAVE AND GO OUT OF CONTROL. AND I DID. THE RESULTS ARE SO OBVIOUS. I&rsquo;M ABOUT AS COMPLEX AS A CARTOON.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING IN PARIS AND L.A.? WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF FASHION IN THE TWO CITIES?&nbsp; I HAVEN&rsquo;T BEEN BACK TO L.A. FOR 7 YEARS BUT THERE&rsquo;S A DIRECTNESS TO AMERICAN STYLE THAT&rsquo;S VERY APPEALING. BUT IT&rsquo;S VERY CLEAN AND I FELT THAT MY CLOTHES WOULD BECOME MARGINALIZED IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AS TOO WEIRD. I STARTED SHOWING MY CLOTHES IN PARIS BECAUSE NOTHING&rsquo;S TOO WEIRD THERE. I&rsquo;M NOT EVEN WEIRD ENOUGH.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE BEST DESIGN YOU HAVE EVER DONE IN ALL OF YOUR PREVIOUS COLLECTIONS?&nbsp; THE DESIGN THAT I&rsquo;M PROBABLY RECOGNIZED THE MOST FOR IS A WASHED LEATHER MOTORCYCLE JACKET.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN PEOPLE YOU REFER YOU AS A &ldquo;RADICAL&rdquo; IN THE FASHION BUSINESS?&nbsp; FLATTERED. I&rsquo;M FLATTERED TO BE REFERRED TO AT ALL.&nbsp; WHO IS YOUR FAVOURITE FASHION DESIGNER? AND WHY?&nbsp; PROBABLY MARIANO FORTUNY. DOING THOSE CLOTHES AT THAT TIME MUST HAVE BEEN AS RADICAL AS PUNK ROCK. I LOVE GOING TO HIS PALAZZO IN VENICE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PAST 2 BIENNALES. AXEL VERVOORDT, THE BELGIAN COLLECTOR, INSTALLS A SHOW OF CONTEMPORARY AND ANCIENT ART IN THE SPACE, LEAVING FORTUNY&rsquo;S FURNISHINGS AND ART IN THE SPACE AS WELL. YOU DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHICH COLLECTION IS VERVOORDT&#39;S AND WHICH IS FORTUNY&rsquo;S. HEAVEN.&nbsp; HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR WORK STYLE?&nbsp; EILEEN GREY AND JOSEPH BEUYS OPEN A LEATHER BAR TOGETHER AND INVITE KISS OVER.&nbsp; WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR INSPIRATIONS FROM MOST OF THE TIME?&nbsp; ARCHITECTURE. LOOKING AT BEAUTIFUL SPACES BY LUIGI MORETTI OR FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT OR ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS REMINDS ME TO BE CONSISTENT AND COMMITTED.&nbsp; DO YOU ENJOY DESIGNING BAGS? DO YOU ENJOY DESIGNING SHOES MORE?&nbsp; I&rsquo;VE HAD A LOT TO LEARN TECHNICALLY TO GET WHAT I WANTED, AND I&rsquo;M STARTING TO REALLY ENJOY IT. I DO THINK I ENJOY SHOES MORE. I BELIEVE THE SHOES SAY IT ALL.&nbsp; WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIAL DETAILS IN YOUR JACKET DESIGN? AND IS THERE SPECIFIC ELEMENT/DETAIL THAT YOU FOCUS ON WHEN DESIGNING A NEW COLLECTION?&nbsp; I LIKE SLIM, LONG, LONG SLEEVES AND A SMALL SHOULDER WITH HIGH ARMHOLES. THEN I LIKE EVERYTHING CASCADING AND WRAPPING DOWN AROUND THE BODY FROM THERE. WHEN I START A NEW COLLECTION, I USUALLY FIND ONE OR TWO NEW VOLUMES OR LINES TO PLAY WITH. I LIKE SIMPLICITY, BUT IF I&rsquo;M GOING TO INTRODUCE SOMETHING NEW EVERY SEASON, I ENJOY A MOMENT OF EXAGGERATION.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU NEED AT WORK?&nbsp; ORDER.&nbsp; CAN YOU SHARE WITH US SOME OF THE DESIGNS/THINGS YOU&rsquo;VE DONE THAT HAS BROKEN THE SO-CALLED &ldquo;RULES OF FASHION/STYLE&rdquo;?&nbsp; I SUPPOSE I PROMOTE A RAWNESS THAT I&rsquo;VE HEARD REFERRED TO AS ANTI-FASHION BY SOME.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE COLOUR? AND WHY?&nbsp; I LIKE THE GENTLENESS AND AMBIGUITY OF GREY. THERE&rsquo;S SO MANY DIFFERENT GREYS AND THEY CAN SUGGEST DAWN OR TWILIGHT; A HUSHED TRANSITIONAL MOMENT...MYSTERY.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE FABRIC? AND WHY?&nbsp; FINE COTTON JERSEY. MODEST, FUNCTIONAL, NAKED FEELING.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE A MUSE? WHO IS IT? AND WHY?&nbsp; OF COURSE, THE HUN, MY BETTER HALF. I&rsquo;M A CONCRETE BLOCK, SHE&rsquo;S A FOG OF PERFUME.&nbsp; WHERE IS YOUR FAVOURITE PLACE TO SHOP?&nbsp; LA GRANDE EPICERIE IN PARIS, FOR GROCERIES.&nbsp; WHO ARE YOUR FAVOURITE MUSICIANS?&nbsp; MONTSERRAT CABALLE AND IGGY POP.&nbsp; WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU LISTEN TO?&nbsp; I&rsquo;VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE NEW DISCO THAT&rsquo;S COMING OUT LIKE HARD TON, SHIT ROBOT AND CRAZY B TCH IN A CAVE. I LIKE THAT GIDDINESS AND SUPERFICIALITY. WHEN I WORK OUT I LISTEN TO HARDSTYLE LIKE TRANCE GENERATORS. I&rsquo;LL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE IN MY HEART FOR IGGY&rsquo;S &ldquo;THE IDIOT&rdquo; ALBUM OR THE SISTERS OF MERCY, BUT AT THIS POINT IT&rsquo;S A NOSTALGIC MEMORY.&nbsp; ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THE &ldquo;GOTH&rdquo; TAG THAT THE FASHION WORLD HAS ATTACHED TO YOU?&nbsp; I WOULDN&rsquo;T HAVE CHOSEN IT BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENED AND DON&rsquo;T FIGHT IT. NEXT TO A LOT OF LABELS, I SUPPOSE I AM. MY FAVORITE WAS BEING CALLED &ldquo;THE GRANDFATHER OF GOTH.&rdquo; YOU HAVE TO LAUGH AT THAT.&nbsp; HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE YOUR STYLE IN SIMPLE WORDS? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR CLOTHES TO SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER SEEN THEM?&nbsp; I SAID &ldquo;BROKEN IDEALISM&rdquo; ONCE, AND THAT STILL SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.&nbsp; AS THE FASHION PR OF V2K DESIGNERS [THE MULTI-LABEL STORE THAT CARRIES YOUR COLLECTIONS IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY], I HAVE NOTICED THAT YOUR CLOTHES ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE FLAT IMAGES OF. I WONDER WHAT YOUR DESIGN PROCESS IS LIKE? DO YOU SKETCH FIRST? BECAUSE THEY ALSO SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CONCEIVED TWO-DIMENSIONALLY.&nbsp; I GUESS I&rsquo;M JUST ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT CAN TRANSLATE 3D TO FLAT IN MY HEAD. I CAN&rsquo;T DO MATH FOR S IT.&nbsp; YOUR NAME IS VERY MUCH SYNONYMOUS WITH YOUR WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER, MICHELE LAMY. HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?&nbsp; THIS GUY I WAS GOING OUT WITH WAS A MUTUAL FRIEND AND ARRANGED FOR ME TO WORK FOR HER. SHE HAD A COLLECTION OF HER OWN AT THE TIME IN LOS ANGELES. IT TOOK 2 YEARS BEFORE I COULD UNDERSTAND HER HEAVY FRENCH ACCENT, AND THEN IT WAS INEVITABLE. COULD YOU SEE EITHER ONE OF US WITH ANYONE ELSE? I&rsquo;M PRETTY SURE WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. SHE HAS ALL THE QUALITIES I DON&rsquo;T: SPONTANEITY, INSTINCT, DEEP EMOTION AND PERCEPTION. SHE&rsquo;S MY PERSONAL BEAUTIFUL WITCH.&nbsp; IN MY POINT OF VIEW, THERE&rsquo;S A TIME FOR EVERY DESIGNER IN THE HISTORY OF FASHION. MID-&#39;80S WERE THE VERSACE YEARS, CALVIN KLEIN RULED IN THE EARLY &#39;90S, ETC. I THINK WE ARE HAVING A RICK OWENS MOMENT NOWADAYS, AS WE SEE YOUR CREATIONS (ESPECIALLY THE LEATHER JACKETS) ON ALMOST EVERYONE FROM THE YOUNG HOLLYWOOD TYPES TO THE TOP FASHION EDITORS. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU ARE ALSO WIDENING YOUR RETAIL TERRITORY WITH STORES IN NEW YORK AND LONDON. WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS HAPPENING NOW?&nbsp; WHO CAN FIGURE THIS KIND OF THING OUT? IT COULD BE SOMETHING AS PROSAIC AS HAVING HAD GOOD PARTNERS THAT DELIVERED THE MERCHANDISE IN ENOUGH TIME FOR THE CLOTHES TO HAVE A GOOD SELL-THROUGH IN STORES AND CREATE A GOOD REPUTATION WITH BUYERS WHO THEN FEATURED THEM AND PROMOTED THEM TO CLIENTS WHO THEN HAD AN EXTRA MINUTE TO GET USED TO THAT AESTHETIC. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PLACE IN THE FASHION WORLD FOR A DARK ELEGANCE. MAYBE I WAS ABLE TO PROPOSE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.&nbsp; AND YOU ARE STILL KEEPING IT QUIET IN ADVERTISING. WHY? IS THAT A WAY OF AVOIDING TO BECOME A MAINSTREAM BRAND AND STAY AS MYSTERIOUS AS YOU CAN BE?&nbsp; I WANTED MY CLOTHES TO BE A QUIET STORY. I DIDN&rsquo;T START MY COLLECTIONS WITH ADVERTISING AND AM PERFECTLY CONTENT WITH THE PACE OF OUR GROWTH. IF I WERE MY CLIENT, I THINK I WOULD CRINGE TO SEE THIS LABEL ADVERTISE.&nbsp; DOES IT BOTHER YOU TO SEE FAMOUS PEOPLE WEARING YOUR CREATIONS? YOU DON&rsquo;T SEEM THE TYPE WHO ENJOYS CELEBRITY PR.&nbsp; FRANKLY, I&rsquo;M PLEASED TO SEE ANYBODY RESPOND TO MY CLOTHES. I DIDN&rsquo;T MEAN FOR IT TO BE AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB; RATHER, AN INCLUSIVE ONE. FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE AS WELCOME TO WEAR MY CLOTHES AS NON-FAMOUS ONES.&nbsp; WITH STORES IN PARIS, NEW YORK AND LONDON, HOW DO YOU SEE THE CLIENT PROFILE OF THE THREE CITIES? HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE RICK OWENS CLIENTELE IN ISTANBUL WILL BE?&nbsp; I WOULD PROBABLY AVOID CATEGORIZING OR CHARACTERIZING PEOPLE FROM THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES I SELL TO. BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS SOMEWHAT RECLUSIVE, I DO FEEL THAT THIS WAS MY WAY OF PERSONALLY ENGAGING WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON THAT FELT A CONNECTION TO MY CLOTHES. AND I ALLOW MYSELF TO BE VERY FULFILLED WITH THAT.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;VE ALSO STARTED DESIGNING FURNITURE. WHAT PROMPTED YOU?&nbsp; ANYONE GIVEN THE OPTION WOULD CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING THEY ENGAGE WITH EVERY DAY. I FULLY INTEND TO GO AS FAR AS CUSTOMIZING MY LIGHT SOCKETS.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE FURNITURE COLLECTION LIKE?&nbsp; I WANT IT TO FURNISH AN ART DECO LEATHER BAR DESIGNED BY EILEEN GREY AND LE CORBUSIER WITH MONTSERRAT CABALLE SINGING IN THE BACKGROUND.&nbsp; ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE DESIGNED IS YOUR BODY, I GUESS. WHAT IS THE SECRET TO HAVING A SCULPTURAL ONE LIKE YOURS? I SAW THESE AWESOME PICTURES OF YOU WORKING OUT IN INDUSTRIE MAGAZINE. HOW OFTEN DO YOU GO TO THE GYM?&nbsp; I GO 5 TIMES A WEEK. IT USED TO BE ABOUT HEALTH AND POWER BUT NOW IT&rsquo;S BECOME ABOUT RELEASE AND MEDITATION. IT&rsquo;S BECOME A PERSONAL RITUAL FOR FEELING FULLY ALIVE, LIKE DISCO DANCING TO THE SUPERLOUD MUSIC ON MY EARPHONES. IT&rsquo;S BECOME AS NORMAL AS BRUSHING MY TEETH EVERY DAY.&nbsp; I&rsquo;VE THIS QUOTE OF YOU PRINTED THAT SITS ON MY FRIDGE DOOR: &ldquo;BUY LESS CLOTHING AND GO TO THE GYM INSTEAD.&rdquo; ISN&rsquo;T IT A CONTROVERSIAL THING TO SAY FOR SOMEONE WHO MAKES AND SELLS CLOTHES?&nbsp; WELL, OBVIOUSLY I WAS BEING GLIB, BUT I WOULD HOPE THE FEWER PIECES YOU BOUGHT WOULD BE MINE.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU THINK OF GARETH PUGH? I KNOW YOU ARE A HUGE SUPPORTER.&nbsp; GARETH HAS A DISTINCTIVE VISION THAT HE CAN CREATE USING THIN AIR. I LOVE HIS TECHNICAL PROWESS AND FOCUS AND HIS GRACEFUL EXECUTION OF IT.&nbsp; STILL TALKING IN F/W 2010-11 TERMS, WHAT DOES THE WORD &ldquo;GLEAM&rdquo; MEAN TO YOU?&nbsp; A QUIET AND CALM SUPERNATURAL SHINE.&nbsp; WHAT IS A PERFECT DAY IN PARIS?&nbsp; AN OLD MOVIE WHEN I WAKE UP WITH MY COFFEE; LOGICAL DESIGN SOLUTIONS ALL DAY; A WALK THROUGH THE TUILERIES TO THE GYM; AND DINNER ACROSS THE TABLE FROM MICHELE ON A TERRACE WITH THE SUNSET.

MY ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS TO NEUTRALIZE EXPERIMENTAL SILHOUETTES BY DOING THEM IN WASHED GREYS. I WANTED TO CREATE GENTLE AND CONTROLLED EXAGGERATION. GREY REPRESENTS STILLNESS, AMBIGUITY, TRANSITION AND SUSPENSE TO ME; DAWN OR DUSK?&nbsp; IS GOTHIC AN APT WORD TO DEFINE YOUR WORLD?&nbsp; I ACCEPT IT AS AN EASY WAY FOR ME TO BE CATEGORIZED IN A BUSY WORLD. I WOULDN&rsquo;T USE IT MYSELF.&nbsp; JUDGING FROM YOUR FURNITURE AND THE CLOTHING YOU DESIGN, YOU HAVE A PRECISE VISION OF AN IDEAL WORLD: WHAT DEFINES IT?&nbsp; IT&rsquo;S AN IDEALISM THAT ACCEPTS FLAWS AND IMPERFECTIONS. AN IDEALISM THAT DOESN&rsquo;T JUDGE OR CONDEMN. AND AN IDEALISM THAT SENSES THAT CORRUPTION IS INEVITABLE.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE FUTURE GOING TO BE LIKE? IS THERE A WAY TO ESCAPE FASHION&rsquo;S OBSESSION WITH THE PAST?&nbsp; I WONDER IF THE PAST IS A CONSOLING DIRECTION TO TAKE WHEN OVERWHELMED WITH TOO MANY OPTIONS. MAYBE AFTER THE INITIAL SHOCK OF THE INTERNET ON OUR GENERATION SOFTENS, I&rsquo;D LIKE TO SEE FASHION BECOME MORE ABOUT CALCULATED FLAMBOYANCE. I SEE FLAMBOYANCE AS A SIMPLE EXPRESSION OF JOY. LIKE DANCING.&nbsp; WHAT IS BEAUTY TO YOU? DO YOU LOOK FOR BEAUTY IN YOUR WORK?&nbsp; I LOOK FOR BEAUTY ALL DAY LONG. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, THE CLOTHES I PRESENT ARE MY PERSONAL INTERPRETATION OF BEAUTY.&nbsp; YOUR CLOTHES ARE BOTH SHARPLY DEFINED IN TERMS OF SHAPES AS THEY ARE UNDEFINED: THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO THE PAST, NOT EVEN TO A SPECIFIC BODY SHAPE OR AGE. DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND, A MAN AND A WOMAN, WHILE YOU DESIGN, OR IS THIS FOGGINESS INTENTIONAL?&nbsp; I HAVEN&rsquo;T FIGURED THIS OUT YET. I TRY NOT TO ANALYZE OR DEFINE TOO MUCH. THERE NEEDS TO BE A BIT OF MYSTERY, EVEN FOR MYSELF. I KNOW THAT I WANT TO PRESENT AN INCLUSIVE WORLD RATHER THAN AN EXCLUSIVE ONE, AND THAT I WANT TO MIX THE PRIMAL WITH THE FUTURISTIC.&nbsp; DO YOU AGREE THAT THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO GENDERS ARE BEING BLURRED THESE DAYS? ARE GENDERLESSNESS AND ANDROGYNY CONCEPTS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M PERSONALLY VERY ATTRACTED TO ANDROGYNY. AND IN MY FASHION NICHE, I ENJOY PROPOSING IT. BUT IN THE WORLD IN GENERAL, I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE CELEBRATING AND EMPHASIZING THEIR GENDER. I DON&rsquo;T SEE THAT CHANGING A LOT. NOR SHOULD IT.&nbsp; YOUR WORLD IS ALL ABOUT CONTRASTS: HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR AND DECAY, TOUGHNESS AND GRACE. IS IT THAT MAKES IT SO STRIKINGLY CONTEMPORARY?&nbsp; I THINK IT&rsquo;S JUST THAT I&rsquo;M MIXING CODES THAT PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION RELATE TO.&nbsp; WHAT IS MODERN, TO YOU? ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE LANGUAGE OF MODERNISM?&nbsp; I LOVE THE WORDS MODERNISM AND FUTURISM. THEY&rsquo;RE ASPIRATIONAL (ANOTHER WORD I LOVE). THERE&#39;S A POIGNANCY TO THESE URGES IN THAT IT&rsquo;S IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH THE HEIGHT THAT WAS INTENDED. MODERNISM TO ME IS A GRACEFUL, UNCOMPLICATED LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B.&nbsp; WHAT IS CLASSIC, ON THE OTHER HAND? ARE YOU INTERESTED IN TIMELESSNESS AS A QUALITY?&nbsp; YES. IT&rsquo;S ALWAYS REASSURING TO SEE THE CROWD IN THE HERMES STORE IN PARIS.&nbsp; IS IT THE STREET THAT INFLUENCES FASHION, OR THE OTHER WAY ROUND?&nbsp; IT SEEMS TO RICOCHET BACK AND FORTH THESE DAYS, DOESN&rsquo;T IT? WHICH CAME FIRST, THE EGG OR THE CHICKEN?&nbsp; CREATIVELY, DO YOU FEEL PART OF ANY SCHOOL, EVEN AN IDEAL ONE?&nbsp; I WOULD LOVE TO BE CALLED A MODERNIST. BUT I&rsquo;LL PROBABLY ALWAYS BE CALLED A GOTH.&nbsp; YOUR WORK IS MORE ABOUT SUBTRACTION THAN ADDITION. DO YOU AGREE THAT LESS IS MORE?&nbsp; MAYBE IT&rsquo;S NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT IT&rsquo;S WHAT I&rsquo;M INTERESTED IN. I WOULD NEVER DICTATE IT. I SUPPOSE I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE FEWEST RESPONSIBILITIES AND ATTACHMENTS POSSIBLE. UNCLUTTERED FREEDOM.&nbsp; DO YOU AGREE THAT ETHICS HAS TO MATCH AN AESTHETIC? LESS IS MORE, FOR EXAMPLE, IS AS MUCH ABOUT SHARP LINES AS IT IS ABOUT GETTING RID OF ALL THAT&rsquo;S NOT NECESSARY.&nbsp; I LIKE THE MODESTY AND RESTRAINT IN REDUCTIVISM. AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF PRODUCING MORE THAN YOU CONSUME. AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF ACTION INSTEAD OF WORDS.&nbsp; HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE AS PATTERN CUTTER INFLUENCED THE WAY YOU SEE CLOTHES IN RELATION TO THE BODY, AND THE WAY YOU DESIGN THEM, AND YOUR SILHOUETTE?&nbsp; I BECAME A PATTERN CUTTER SO I COULD CREATE IN 3D. AS I GET OLDER, I APPRECIATE MORE THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE COME EASIER FOR ME THAN SOME OTHERS.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU BALANCE ART AND COMMERCE? YOUR WORK IS CONSISTENTLY EXPERIMENTAL, BUT ALSO VERY SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIALLY, WHICH IS RARE. IT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE REACT DEEPLY TO. DO YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS?&nbsp; I&rsquo;M TOO PRACTICAL TO SUCCUMB TO FUNCTIONLESS BEAUTY. THIS CAN BE A STRENGTH OR A CURSE SOMETIMES. AND I TRY TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE IN. I LIKE TO THINK THAT PEOPLE SENSE THAT ATTEMPT.&nbsp; WHAT INTERESTS AND INSPIRES YOU?&nbsp; LOOKING AT ARCHITECTURE IS ALWAYS VERY SATISFYING. WHEN I DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHAT I&rsquo;M DOING, LOOKING AT LE CORBUSIER, NIEMEYER OR MORETTI ALWAYS GIVES ME DIRECTION. THEIR KIND OF CONSISTENT, CONFIDENT VISION ALWAYS FEEDS ME.&nbsp; THE CULT-LIKE AURA THAT SURROUNDS YOUR WORK: IS IT INTENTIONAL OR ACCIDENTAL?&nbsp; BELIEVE ME, I&rsquo;M AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE THAT I GOT THIS FAR.&nbsp; WHAT IS YOUR MAIN MOTIVATION, AS A DESIGNER?&nbsp; TO PROPOSE MY VERSION OF BEAUTY TO THOSE WHO WANT IT, IN AN EFFORT TO ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD AROUND ME.&nbsp; IN FASHION, IS THERE STILL ROOM LEFT FOR INNOVATION?&nbsp; THERE&rsquo;S ALWAYS ROOM FOR INNOVATION. THE URGE FOR PROGRESS IS THE HUMAN CONDITION.&nbsp; WHO IS RICK OWENS? HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE YOURSELF?&nbsp; A FLAWED MAN WHO FORGIVES HIMSELF AND IS TRYING HIS BEST.&nbsp; WHAT AMUSES YOU?&nbsp; I WOULDN&rsquo;T KNOW WHERE TO START. I WOULD BE TOO EMBARRASED TO BE A BROODING, TORTURED ARTIST. I FIND ENJOYMENT EVERYWHERE.&nbsp; HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP YOUR WORK IN A FORMULA?&nbsp; BROKEN IDEALISM.&nbsp; ONE HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE FROM NOW, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE REMEMBERED?&nbsp; A COMMITTED MODERNIST THAT ENJOYED A MODEST SUCCESS ON THE MARGINS OF THE FASHION WORLD AND RESPECTED HIS CLIENTS.

IT&#39;S HER AFFECTION FOR THE FURRIERS, THE ARTISANS, THE CRAFTSMEN THAT IT TAKES TO WORK WITH FUR THAT MAKES IT A REAL LABOR OF LOVE. SHE TAKES HER FAVORITE SILHOUETTES FROM MY COLLECTIONS AND EDITS THEM, REPROPORTIONS THEM, PERSONALIZES THEM AND TRANSLATES THEM INTO FUR. IT TAKES HER KIND OF MAGIC TO MAKE THIS FUR COLLECTION WHAT IT IS.&nbsp; WHAT TIME DO YOU WAKE UP EVERY DAY?&nbsp; 7:00.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU DREAM OF WHEN YOU ARE AWAKE?&nbsp; ORDER.&nbsp; AND WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP?&nbsp; ORDER COLLAPSING.&nbsp; WHAT DESIGNERS OR ARTISTS INFLUENCE YOUR WORK?&nbsp; LE CORBUSIER, LUIGI MORETTI, JEAN MICHEL-FRANK, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, EILEEN GREY. I LOOK AT THEIR WORK DAILY. THEIR SOOTHING CONSISTENCY AND RATIONALISM GIVES ME AN ALMOST MEDITATIVE CALM.&nbsp; WHY DO YOU HAVE SCULPTURES AND REPLICAS OF YOURSELF IN YOUR SHOPS?&nbsp; I ORIGINALLY COMMISIONED ONE AS A MODERN VERSION OF A PORTRAIT OVER THE MANTLEPIECE. TRADITIONALY WHEN A MAN REACHES A CERTAIN STATION IN LIFE HE HAS A PORTRAIT PAINTED. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AMUSING EXERCISE IN VANITY AND MORTALITY WITH A DARK UNDERTONE. THERE&#39;S A TRAGIC QUALITY TO TRYING TO CAPTURE YOURSELF FOREVER AT YOUR PRIME. BUT IT BECAME BORING IN THE HOUSE, AND I THOUGHT THE PARIS STORE COULD USE A LITTLE PERVERSITY. NOW ALL THE STORES DON&#39;T FEEL COMPLETE WITHOUT ONE. I&#39;VE ALWAYS SAID THAT MY CLOTHES ARE MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY, SO THE FIGURES SEEM TO ILLUSTRATE THAT.&nbsp; YOU REMAIN ONE OF THE FEW DESIGNERS TO MANAGED TO ESTABLISH A BRAND NAME WITHOUT ADVERTISING OR A BIG PRESS MACHINE.

I CAN&rsquo;T SAY THERE&rsquo;S ANY COMPARISON, BUT IT WAS KIND OF WHAT I WAS AIMING FOR.&nbsp; YOU DON&rsquo;T FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY. YOU EVEN REFERRED TO THE EFFORTS OF OTHER FASHION DESIGNERS TO ENCOURAGE ECOLOGICAL AND ETHICAL AWARENESS AS HYPOCRITICAL. WHAT ARE YOUR RULES?&nbsp; OH DEAR, DO I REALLY SOUND THAT JUDGEMENTAL? I CERTAINLY DON&rsquo;T MEAN TO. AND I&rsquo;M CERTAIN THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST DEGREE OF CONCIOUSNESS HELPS. BUT PERSONALLY, AS A DESIGNER MAKING EXPENSIVE CLOTHES THAT NOBODY REALLY NEEDS, AND DOING SHOWS THAT HAVE MODELS AND HAIRDRESSERS WITH HAIRSPRAY FLYING ALL OVER THE PLACE, I FEEL A LITTLE SILLY EVEN ADDRESSING IT. SUFFICE TO SAY I AM CONSCIOUS OF TRYING TO PRODUCE MORE THAN I CONSUME.&nbsp; ARE THERE ANY ROLE MODELS IN THE FASHION BUSINESS WHOM YOU ADMIRE OR BY WHOM YOU ARE INSPIRED?&nbsp; LEGIONS. THERE ARE A LOT OF GLAMOROUS CHARACTERS THAT GET MOST OF THE ATTENTION, BUT THERE ARE COUNTLESS DEDICATED AND TALENTED PEOPLE THAT HAVE A DETERMINED WORK ETHIC AND DEDICATION TO PERFECTION. I THINK FASHION IS A LOT SMARTER THAN ART NOW. FASHION HAS TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE&#39;S GUT A LOT FASTER.&nbsp; IN COOPERATION WITH EASTPAK, YOU LAUNCHED THE COLLECTION CALLED DRKSHDW. AS AN INDIVIDUALIST, WHAT IS THE APPEAL OF A COLLABORATION?&nbsp; IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT THAT FRANKLY WAS SOMETHING I PROBABLY WON&rsquo;T REPEAT. THE EASTPAK ORGANIZATION IS FANTASTIC, BUT I&rsquo;M A D CK. I&rsquo;M NOT REALLY A GOOD COLLABORATOR. IT TAKES ME A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP A COMFORTABLE COMMUNICATION WITH SOMEONE, AND I PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE.&nbsp; WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOUR STYLE OF FASHION, THEY OFTEN DESCRIBE IT AS &quot;DARK AND GLAMOROUS GOTHIC-CHIC.&quot; DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT OR COULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR LOOK DIFFERENTLY?&nbsp; WELL, I THINK THAT ANYTHING OVER-ANALYZED OR EXPLAINED LOSES ITS MAGIC. I&rsquo;M JUST HAPPY THAT ANYONE FINDS SOMETHING TO RESPOND TO. IN THE PAST I&rsquo;VE DESCRIBED MY VIBE AS &quot;EILEEN GREY AND JEAN MICHEL-FRANK DESIGN A LEATHER BAR AND INVITE KISS OVER.&quot; OR &quot;BIBLICAL, BRUTALIST, BAUHAUS, BAKERSFIELD.&quot; OR &quot; BROKEN IDEALISM.&quot; YOU&rsquo;RE WELCOME TO TAKE YOUR PICK.&nbsp; WHICH GARMENT IS A MUST-HAVE IN EVERY WOMAN&rsquo;S CLOSET THIS SEASON, AND WHICH TREND CAN BE DISMISSED?&nbsp; SHOES USUALLY SAY IT ALL, SO BLACK LEATHER HIGH-HEELED BOOTS ARE SOMEWHERE TO START. I HONESTLY CAN&rsquo;T THINK OF ANYTHING TO DISMISS. I SEE ANYTHING UNATTRACTIVE AS A CHALLENGE TO TWIST IT INTO SOMETHING GOOD. THERE&rsquo;S ALWAYS ROOM FOR SOME PERVERSITY.&nbsp; YOU ARE OFTEN CATEGORIZED AS &quot;WALKING ON THE DARK SIDE,&quot; SO STATEMENTS LIKE &quot;I LIGHTENED UP&quot; AND &quot;I WAS TOYING WITH PRETTY THIS TIME&quot; SEEMS EXCEPTIONAL FROM YOU. WHERE DID THAT CHANGE OF MIND COME FROM?&nbsp; I THINK I JUST MEANT A LESS INSISTENT APPROACH. WITH MORE AIR IN IT. LET&rsquo;S JUST SAY THE SOUFFLE WAS STILL BITTER CHOCOLATE, JUST WHIPPED A LITTLE FROTHIER.

DOES IT STILL MAKE YOU HAPPY? MAYBE MORE SO. I’VE LEARNED HOW TO PACE MYSELF BETTER. I CAN APPRECIATE EVERYTHING IN RELATIVE CALM NOW, WITHOUT FEELING LIKE WE COULD DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT. I FEEL LIKE I’D REALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING MAJORLY STUPID TO F CK IT UP NOW. DO YOU FIND DESIGNING FURNITURE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TO DESIGNING CLOTHES? AND WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO MOVE INTO FURNITURE DESIGN? NOW THAT I THINK OF IT, I ACTUALLY DON’T THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. IT’S ABOUT TRYING TO FIND RATIONAL GRACE IN RESPECT TO THE HUMAN FORM. IT’S ABOUT COMBINING EVERYTHING I’VE EVER LEARNED INTO A NEW CONFIGURATION. I LIKE THE IDEA OF CREATING A GESAMTKUNSTWERK. IS THAT EGOCENTRIC? PROBABLY. BUT I DON’T SEE WHAT DESIGNER WOULDN’T WANT TO APPLY HIS AESTHETIC TO EVERYTHING AROUND HIM. I JUST CAN’T HELP IT. PLEASE INDULGE ME. YOUR CLOTHES HAVE BEEN LABELLED &quot;GOTH&quot; AND &quot;GRUNGE.&quot; WOULD YOU SAY THAT’S ACCURATE, OR IS IT TOO MUCH OF AN OVER-SIMPLIFICATION? IF A BUSY WORLD NEEDS TO SUMMARIZE ME, I UNDERSTAND. I SUPPOSE AT THE BEGINNING, I ACTUALLY INADVERTENTLY LABELED MYSELF, REFFERING TO MY GOTH YOUTH AND BLITHELY COMBINING THE WORDS GLAMOUR AND GRUNGE INTO &quot;GLUNGE.&quot; I GUESS I MADE MY OWN BED. I’M PROBABLY TOO INTERESTED IN HISTORICAL REFERENCES TO BE A TRUE MODERNIST. YOUR WIFE MICHELE LAMY IS ALSO YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER. HOW IS IT MIXING BUSINESS AND PLEASURE? I ACTUALLY HAVE THREE BUSINESS PARTNERS AND THINK OF MICHELE AS MY LIFE PARTNER. FOR 20 YEARS SHE HAS HUMANIZED ME AND FORCED ME TO STOP AND LOOK UP AT THE SKY AND BREATHE. SHE’S FEROCIOUS, INSTINCTIVE, FUNNY AND MAGIC. SHE’S MY PERSONAL BEAUTIFUL WITCH. DO YOU THINK THE FASHION INDUSTRY PUTS TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON DESIGNERS TO COME UP WITH THE RIGHT GOODS? I THINK IT’S VALIDATING TO FEEL DESIRED. THE MORE DESIRED YOU FEEL, THE MORE YOU WANT TO PRODUCE. NOT A BAD THING. MAYBE NOT A GOOD THING. BUT IT’LL OVERCORRECT AND EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WILL EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING ELSE. I HESITATE TO JUDGE HUMAN NATURE. YOU’VE ADMITTED IN THE PAST TO LIKING WORKING WITH FUR. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU LIKE SO MUCH ABOUT IT, AND DO NEGATIVE REACTIONS FROM ANTI-FUR DEMONSTRATORS DETER YOU? IS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY BE ADMITTED? FUR IS LEATHER, GLORIFIED. IT’S PRIMAL, ELEMENTAL, MIRACULOUS. I HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR IT AS I DO FOR ALL THE BEAUTIFUL MATERIALS I WORK WITH. HAS LIVING IN PARIS AFFECTED YOUR VIEWS ON FASHION AND LIFE IN GENERAL? OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCASION TO SHOW CLOTHES IN PARIS. IT’S VERY STIMULATING TO BE ALLOWED TO DO SO. THERE’S A WONDERFUL ELEMENT OF FLAMBOYANT PERVERSITY THAT’S ENCOURAGED AND CULTIVATED HERE THAT DOESN’T WORK ANYWHERE ELSE. IT HAS TO BE IMMEDIATE, PRECISE AND SMART. NOW, I’M SPEAKING AS A FASHION FAN. BY NO MEANS DO I SUGGEST THAT I’VE MASTERED THIS. BUT I WILL SAY THAT I’VE LEARNED A LOT OF SOMETHING I CAN’T QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON. DO YOU PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE FASHION SCENE? WHICH DESIGNERS DO YOU LIKE AT THE MOMENT? I DO PAY ATTENTION. LIKE I SAID, I’M A FASHION FAN. THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN I HAD A PRESS OFFICE IN PARIS WHERE THE SCENE FELT UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE—AND AT THE SAME TIME LIKE CRASHING A PARTY I HADN’T REALLY BEEN INVITED TO. I REALIZED THAT REMOVING MYSELF WOULD RELIEVE ME OF THAT SELF-CONCIOUSNESS THAT EMBARRASED ME BECAUSE OF ITS CHILDISHNESS. NOW I FEEL THAT ANY ATTENTION COMES AS A LOVELY SURPRISE. WHAT’S NEXT FOR RICK OWENS? I’M BUILDING A GARDEN ON MY ROOFTOP WHICH SHOULD BE READY TO PLANT THIS SUMMER. I HAVE FAIRLY SHORT-TERM, QUIET LITTLE GOALS. WHAT ARE THE BEST AND WORST THINGS ABOUT YOUR JOB? BEING GIVEN THE CHANCE AND MEANS TO EXPRESS YOURSELF IS A JACKPOT. HATING MYSELF FOR MOMENTS OF CUNTY IMPATIENCE ISN’T SO GREAT. ARE YOU INSPIRED BY MUSIC? IF SO, WHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY LISTENING TO? TRANCE GENERATORS TO WIND ME UP AND EYDIE GORME TO WIND ME DOWN. WHAT IS YOUR FAULT? I’M A BOOT-LICKING, PISS-DRINKING, FINGER-FRIGGING, TIT-TWEAKING, LOVE-BITING, ASS-LICKING, S IT-STABBING, MOTHERF CKING SPUNK-LOVING, COCKSUCKING, FIST-F CKING, COOL LIVING, EVER GIVING, USELESS MAN.

SO I WENT TO FASHION. I NOW WONDER IF FASHION MIGHT HAVE SURPASSED ART. IT&rsquo;S A COMMUNICATION THAT HAS TO HAVE MAGIC BUT ALSO BE SHARP, PRECISE AND MORE IMMEDIATE THAN EVER BEFORE. I STILL HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR ARTISTS TO CONSIDER MYSELF ONE, BUT I WONDER IF ON MY DEATH BED, I MIGHT LOOK BACK ON MY BODY OF WORK AND FEEL THAT COLLECTIVELY, IT WAS A WORK OF ART. I MIGHT.&nbsp; AFTER YOUR READY-TO-WEAR SHOW FOR SPRING 2010, MICHAEL STIPE SAID THAT YOUR WORK MAKES &ldquo;THE VISION OF THE FUTURE THAT HE HAD AS A CHILD COME TRUE.&quot; IN FACT, EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS &ldquo;FUTURISTIC&rdquo; AND &ldquo;VISIONARY&rdquo; ARE OFTEN USED REGARDING YOUR DESIGNS. HOW DO YOU IMAGINE THE FUTURE OF FASHION?&nbsp; I LIKE THE WORD &quot;FUTURISM&quot; FOR ITS IDEALISM AND &quot;ASPIRATION&quot; FOR ITS HEROISM. I ALSO LIKE THE POIGNANCY OF THE INEVITABILITY OF FALLING SHORT OF THOSE GOALS. THAT STORY IS ALWAYS SOMEWHERE IN EVERYTHING I DO. I WOULDN&rsquo;T PRESUME TO PREDICT THE FUTURE OF FASHION. THERE ARE TOO MANY UNSEEN CULTURAL VARIABLES WHICH WILL INFLUENCE IT. BUT IT&rsquo;S THAT UNPREDICTABILITY THAT GIVES IT ALL ITS ALLURE.&nbsp; DO YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR PERSON IN MIND WHEN YOU DESIGN A PIECE OF CLOTHING? WHAT&rsquo;S THAT PERSON LIKE?&nbsp; I SUPPOSE I&#39;M SPEAKING TO MYSELF AND MY GENERATION. I&#39;VE ALWAYS BEEN A LONER, AND MAKING CLOTHES WAS THE ONLY WAY I FELT I COULD CONNECT AND COMMUNICATE IN A GENUINE WAY WITH THE WORLD. I EXCLUDE NO ONE.&nbsp; CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF YOUR DESIGNING? IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONCEIVING GARMENTS AND FURNITURE?&nbsp; NOW THAT I THINK OF IT, I ACTUALLY DON&rsquo;T THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. IT&rsquo;S ABOUT TRYING TO FIND RATIONAL GRACE IN RESPECT TO THE HUMAN FORM. IT&rsquo;S ABOUT COMBINING EVERYTHING I&rsquo;VE EVER LEARNED INTO A NEW CONFIGURATION.&nbsp; THROUGHOUT THE LAST DECADE, THE FASHION SECTOR HAS TRANSFORMED FROM MANUFACTURING TO INDUSTRIALIZED PRODUCTION AND IS DOMINATED BY TWO OR THREE CONGLOMERATES. YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW DESIGNERS LEFT WHO HAS NOT SOLD THEIR LABEL TO A CONGLOMERATE AND YOU SEEM TO STICK TO A MORE TRADITIONAL WAY OF PRODUCTION. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR DESIGNS? WHERE IS YOUR MANUFACTURER LOCATED? HOW DO YOU GET FUNDING FOR IT?&nbsp; I MADE CLOTHES MYSELF AT THE BEGINNING AND SOLD THEM TO A FEW OF THE BEST RETAILERS I COULD FIND. CONSEQUENTLY I WAS APPROACHED BY ITALIAN SALES AGENTS WHO INTRODUCED ME TO A MANUFACTURER WHO WAS WILLING TO MANUFACTURE MY CLOTHES. EVERYONE TOOK A SMALL CHANCE, AND WE GREW A BUSINESS TOGETHER. IT&rsquo;S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING SO INNOCENT WORKED. BUT IT TOOK TEACHING EACH OTHER AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER.&nbsp; IN 2003, YOU HAVE MOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES TO PARIS. DO YOU FIND THAT THERE&rsquo;S A FREEDOM FOR FASHION DESIGN IN PARIS OR DO YOU ENCOUNTER THE SAME COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS THERE AS IN THE U.S.?&nbsp; I NEVER REALLY ENCOUNTERED COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE I NEVER REALLY RESISTED THEM. I WANT TO MAKE CLOTHES THAT PEOPLE WILL WEAR.&nbsp; IF FASHION IS A SOCIAL FORM THAT FUNCTIONS AS A PRECURSOR OF SOCIAL CHANGE, WHICH CHANGES WOULD HAPPEN ACCORDING TO YOUR FASHION?&nbsp; I HAD ALWAYS HOPED THAT MY CLOTHES WOULD PROPOSE A PRIMITIVE BUT DISCIPLINED ELEGANCE. I DON&rsquo;T THINK ELEGANT DISCIPLINE WOULD BE A BAD DIRECTION FOR THE WORLD.

BUT I WORE &quot;HUSKY&quot; SIZED POLY PANTS AND HAD BIG SOFT 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL NIPPLES. AND BUCK TEETH. MY PARENTS GAVE ME BRACES, BUT IT WASN&#39;T UNTIL MY EARLY THIRTIES WHEN MY BETTER HALF MICHELE INSISTED THAT I START GOING TO THE GYM. HER REASONING WAS THAT IF I WAS GOING TO DRINK SO MUCH, I HAD TO BALANCE IT OUT. WHEN YOU START, WORKING OUT WITH A TRAINER IS ESSENTIAL. OTHERWISE IT&#39;S TOO EASY TO SUSPECT THAT YOU&#39;RE PROBABLY NOT DOING IT RIGHT, AND GET DISCOURAGED. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SERIOUS CHANGES, HIRE A TRAINER. I COULDN&#39;T REALLY AFFORD IT BUT I PRIORITIZED. I WASN&#39;T VERY SCIENTIFIC ABOUT CHOOSING TRAINERS. FRANKLY THE MAIN QUALIFICATIONS WERE THAT THEY HAD TO LOOK LIKE THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT, AND BE SOMEONE PLEASANT TO HANG OUT WITH EVERY DAY. BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW TECHNICAL YOU GET, THE MAIN THING, THE MAIN THING, THE MAIN THING, IS CONSISTENT REPETITION. AFTER YEARS OF ENJOYING OVERINDULGENCE, DISCIPLINE FELT EVEN BETTER. THE CHANGES WERE IMPERCEPTIBLE FROM MONTH TO MONTH, BUT AFTER A YEAR THINGS HAD CHANGED. BY THEN I WAS HOOKED. I NEVER HAD THE PATIENCE FOR SUPPLEMENTS, SO I JUST TOOK STEROIDS AND RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. SURE THEY BLOATED ME FOR A WHILE, BUT AFTER I STOPPED, THE BLOAT WENT AWAY AND THE STEROIDS HAD GOTTEN ME TO ANOTHER LEVEL. IT WAS VERY REWARDING. AND I&#39;D CERTAINLY TAKEN WORSE BEFORE. I CAN REMEMBER AROUND 5 TRAINERS OVER AN 8-YEAR PERIOD. I&#39;M AFRAID I WAS TERRIBLY PASSIVE AND TOOK LITTLE NOTICE AT THE TIME OF THE WEIGHTS THAT THE TRAINERS ADJUSTED AND THE EFFORTS THEY WENT TO TO BRING VARIETY TO OUR WORKOUTS. THERE&#39;S REALLY ONLY ABOUT 10 THINGS YOU CAN DO, AND YOU JUST HAVE TO DO THEM OVER AND OVER. LIKE A DONALD JUDD INSTALLATION. CLASSIC, SIMPLE, PURE, REPETITIVE.&nbsp; I GUESS THAT WAS ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO. WHEN I MOVED TO PARIS 7 YEARS AGO, I DIDN&#39;T HIRE A TRAINER. I&#39;M NO LONGER AS GOAL-ORIENTED, AND NEED MORE PERSONAL SPACE NOW. WORKING OUT HAS BECOME A NATURAL FUNCTION OF THE DAY. LIKE BRUSHING MY TEETH. AT THIS POINT, IT&#39;S BECOME A COMBO OF DISCIPLINE, JOYOUS RELEASE, MEDITATION AND VANITY. IT GIVES ME A BREAK IN THE DAY TO ABSORB AND FORMULATE IDEAS. I LOVE THE WALK THROUGH THE TUILERIES AND UP RUE DE LA PAIX AND SEEING OPERA GARNIER COME INTO VIEW, WHERE MY GYM IS. I USED TO LOVE DANCING AND MUSIC NEVER SOUNDED AS GOOD AS IT DOES NOW THROUGH THOSE EARBUD HEADPHONES POUNDING BASS INTO THE PIT OF MY STOMACH AS I ENJOY THE SIMPLE PLEASURE OF FEELING PHYSICALLY ALIVE. I DO ONE LEG PART, 2 UPPER BODY PARTS, STOMACH AND STRETCHING EVERY TIME I GO, WHICH IS 5 OR 6 TIMES A WEEK. I TAKE MY TIME AND DON&#39;T WORRY ABOUT THE WEIGHTS, I JUST DO WHAT FEELS GOOD. I DON&#39;T FEEL THE NEED TO FORCE MY BODY THE WAY I USED TO. I SMOKE, I DON&#39;T PARTICULARLY WATCH MY DIET, AND I HATE CARDIO. IF I HAD TO RUN A MILE I&#39;D PROBABLY PASS OUT IN A POOL OF VOMIT. MY REGIMEN&#39;S NOT PARTICULARLY CEREBRAL AND FAIRLY HYPOCRITICAL. OBVIOUSLY, I REPLACED THE ROMANTICIZED DETERMINATION TO SELF-DESTRUCT WITH THE FANTASY OF CONTROL AND IMMORTALITY. AND AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, IT&#39;S AS LOVELY AN INDULGENCE AS ANY.

HONORE. IT&#39;S ALWAYS A DELIGHT LOOKING AT THOSE CLOTHES AND I ALWAYS PICK UP BOTTLES OF AVIGNON INCENSE PARFUM.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE JEWELLERY STORE?&nbsp; NAILA DE MONBRISON ON RUE DE BOURGOGNE IS THE MOST PERFECT SHOP I KNOW. I LOVE THE BEIGE COLOR OF THE CURTAIN IN THE WINDOW, THE LITTLE CASES IN THE WALL AND THE INDUSTRIAL METAL FITTINGS. IT FEELS LIKE A LITTLE ESOTERIC CORNER DESIGNED BY PIERRE CHAREAU. AND THE JEWELRY IS BOLD, BARBARIC AND RADICAL.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE PERFUME/FRAGRANCE SHOP?&nbsp; WHEN I CAME TO PARIS THE FIRST TIME AROUND 25 YEARS AGO, THE FIRST PLACE I WENT TO WAS THE SERGE LUTENS PARFUM SHOP IN THE PALAIS ROYAL. IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES YOU COULD GET SOMETHING UNAVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. I LOVED HOW HE CREATED HIS OWN MYTHOLOGY OF BEAUTIFULLY EXAGGERATED CREATURES FLOATING IN HIS VERY PERSONAL UNIVERSE. IT FELT LIKE A DIVINE DESTINY TO OPEN MY SHOP NEXT TO IT MANY YEARS LATER.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE HOME FURNISHINGS STORE?&nbsp; I LOVE GALERIE ERIC PHILIPPE IN GALERIE VERO-DODAT. HE CARRIES THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY EDITED SELECTION OF 20TH CENTURY SWEDISH AND DANISH FURNITURE; UNUSUAL PIECES FROM THE SWEDISH GRACE MOVEMENT.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE MUSEUMS?&nbsp; WHEN FRIENDS COME TO PARIS, I LIKE TO TAKE THEM TO THE GUSTAVE MOREAU MUSEUM. I LIKE BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH HIS PERSONAL ROOMS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOY THE LAYERS OF PAINTINGS DISPLAYED IN HIS STUDIO. I LOVE THE HEAVINESS OF THE THICK LAYERS OF MELODRAMATIC SYMBOLISM; ALL THE SALOMES AND SEBASTIANS AND ANGELS OF GOMORRA. IT MAKES YOU DIZZY LIKE TOO MUCH INCENSE AND PERFUME.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE FINE FOODS STORE AND DELICATESSEN?&nbsp; I LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CAKES AT PATISSERIE PAIN DE SUCRE ON RUE RAMBUTEAU. THE WAY THEY PUT STUFF TOGETHER IS LIKE VICTOR AND ROLF AND CHRISTIAN LACROIX IN THE KITCHEN.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE RESTAURANTS?&nbsp; I LIKE WALKING THROUGH THE AIR FRANCE BUS STATION IN THE INVALIDES TO GET TO RESTAURANT CHEZ FRANCOIS UNDERNEATH IT&mdash;UNEXPECTEDLY COZY WITH BIG BANQUETTES, MISMATCHED PILLOWS, PLENTY OF FLOWERS AND A PIANO BY THE BAR.&nbsp; AND THE AMERICAN IN ME IS ALWAYS IMPRESSED WITH THE EXTRAVAGANT AND BEAUTIFULLY TATTERED INTERIORS OF LE TRAIN BLEU. I ALWAYS THINK OF MAGGIE SMITH THERE IN A SCENE FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES, &quot;TRAVELS WITH MY AUNT.&rdquo;&nbsp; BEST PLACE FOR A LATE EVENING DRINK?&nbsp; I LIKE THE ENERGY AT LE MATHIS AFTER I HAVE DINNER THERE. THE TABLES START MOVING AROUND AND A NEW GROUP STARTS COMING IN. AS I&#39;M LEAVING, I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING DELICIOUSLY ILLICIT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AS SOON AS I&#39;M GONE.&nbsp; YOUR FAVOURITE NIGHTCLUB?&nbsp; I LIKE THE MUSIC AT THE REX. I WAKE UP AT 3 AM, HAVE AN ESPRESSO AND GO THERE TO DANCE FOR A FEW HOURS. LIKE WAKING UP EARLY TO GO JOGGING.&nbsp; BEST FLORIST?&nbsp; MOULIE, ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE. IT&#39;S ONE OF THE REASONS I MOVED TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING UNEXPECTED THAT I&#39;VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, FRESH FROM THE COUNTRY.

BUT OPULENT IN A ROUGH, PRIMAL WAY.&nbsp; I ONCE FOUND A PHOTOGRAPH OF A PARK WALL IN BERLIN THAT I&rsquo;VE ADOPTED AS A PERSONAL MOTIF. ITS GEOMETRIC BAS RELIEF CONCRETE LOOKS PRIMITIVE AND FUTURISTIC AT THE SAME TIME. I DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHERE THIS WALL REALLY IS, BUT EVERY TIME I GO TO BERLIN, I KEEP A LOOK-OUT FOR IT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;VE DONE THIS MOTIF IN SHAVED MINK, IN WOOL BROCADE AND IN ALLIGATOR PATCHWORK IN THE PAST. FOR THIS SEASON&rsquo;S WOMENS COLLECTION I DID IT AS &ldquo;SEQUINS&rdquo; IN HORN, AND IN BLEACH-RESIST DENIM.&nbsp; I&rsquo;D BEEN TOYING WITH THE IDEA OF SEQUINS FOR AWHILE AND FINALLY FOUND A WAY TO DO MY VERSION OF THEM. I FOUND AN ARTISAN IN PARIS WHO SPECIALIZES IN DOING CUSTOM WORK IN SPECIAL MATERIALS; MICA APPLIED TO WALLS, CUSTOM IVORY DOOR HANDLES FOR VINTAGE CARS, THAT SORT OF THING. GAVE HIM MY BERLIN WALL MOTIF AND HE CREATED GEOMETRIC SHAPES WITH HOLES IN THEM TO HAND-LACE ONTO SHEARLING COATS.&nbsp; FOR THE BLEACH-RESIST DENIM, I TORTURED MY DENIM WASH HOUSE BY HAVING PANELS OF DENIM SEWN WITH GEOMETRIC PATCHES, STONEWASHED AND BLEACHED, THE PATCHES TORN OFF AND DIFFERENT ONES APPLIED, THE PANEL OVERDYED, THESE PATCHES TORN OFF AND DIFFERENT ONES APPLIED, AND OVERDYED AGAIN. I WANTED SOMETHING LABOR-INTENSIVE IN A RAW WAY. A RAW LUXURY.&nbsp; THESE WERE MY VERSIONS OF SEQUINS AND EMBROIDERY.&nbsp; THE FURS I USED THIS SEASON WERE A BEAUTIFUL GREY KANGAROO, MY FAVORITE PEKAN, AND RUSSIAN SABLE WITH A NAPPA FINISH. I ALSO INCLUDED A FABRIC I HAD CUSTOM-MADE FROM STERLING SILVER THREAD, USUALLY USED FOR ROBE EMBROIDERIES FOR THE VATICAN. I HAD THE THREAD OXYDIZED BEFORE WEAVING IT TO DARKEN AND MUTE THE SHINE.&nbsp; THE MAKEUP FOR THE SHOW HAD TO BE HARD AND ARTIFICIAL IN A KABUKI WAY, SO AS THE INSPIRATION I LOOKED TO MY OLD FRIEND KEMBRA FROM THE BAND THE VOLUPTUOUS HORROR OF KAREN BLACK.&nbsp; I USED AN ACHINGLY ROMANTIC BALLAD FROM GLAM ROCK-ERA QUEEN THAT TRANSITIONED INTO RELENTLESS HARD TECHNO AT THE VERY END (SORRY, I JUST COULDN&rsquo;T HELP IT).&nbsp; I LIKED THE IDEA OF CEREMONIAL ARMOUR FOR A TRIBE OF WOMEN. NOT UNITED IN AGGRESSION, BUT UNITED IN SOME KIND OF COMMUNAL IDEALISTIC GOAL. THE SPACE I USED WAS IN MY FAVORITE BUILDING IN PARIS: TROCADERO. WITH HUGE PROPORTIONS, ITS INTERIOR IS LIKE A TEMPLE LINED WITH PLINTHS SUPPORTING LIT BASINS, WITH HUGE WINDOWS OVERLOOKING THE EIFFEL TOWER. AS THE SHOW STARTED, WE CLOSED ALL THE BLACK CURTAINS AND THE CEREMONY BEGAN.

WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE KEY PIECES OF THIS TREND AND HOW SHOULD YOU WEAR THEM? PERSONALLY, I FEEL LIKE WEARING A LONG JACKET IN CRISP BLACK WITH A SHARP SHOULDER. WHAT ARE THE KEY COLORS AND FABRICS FOR THIS LOOK? WELL, YOU KNOW I&#39;M GONNA SAY BLACK AND BLACK LEATHER. WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THE MINIMALIST DIRECTION THIS SEASON? WHAT INSPIRED YOU? ACTUALLY, I GOT A LITTLE MORE EMBELLISHED THAN USUAL WITH LACING DETAILS IN HEAVY CORD. I WAS THINKING ART DECO SAMURAI PRIESTESS. WHICH &#39;90S FILM ICONS WOULD YOU REFERENCE AS INSPIRATION FOR THIS TREND? TO TELL THE TRUTH, I WOULD PROBABLY GO TO THE &#39;70S.

IT&rsquo;S BEEN A LONG WINTER AND I NEEDED SUN. GOING SOMEPLACE ANCIENT WAS A BIG PLUS. I WENT TO THE CAVES OF PETRA AT DAWN AND IT WAS MAGICAL. EVERY CHANCE I GET, I GO TO A BEACH. IT&rsquo;S SOOTHING, CENTERING AND STABILIZING ALL AT THE SAME TIME.&nbsp; THE HARMONY OF CLOTHING, HAIR, MAKEUP, AND MUSIC MADE THIS COLLECTION SURPRISINGLY POWERFUL. I REMEMBER YOU ONCE SAYING YOU DON&rsquo;T WANT WOMEN TO LOOK ANGRY OR AGGRESSIVE. BUT AT THIS COLLECTION, WOMEN LOOKED LIKE WARRIORS.&nbsp; I KNOW! THEY ALWAYS END UP LOOKING LIKE AN ARMY! I MEAN FOR THEM TO LOOK MORE LIKE A SECT OR A TRIBE, UNIFIED TOWARDS A COMMUNAL IDEAL GOAL IN CEREMONIAL DRESS, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, THEY ENDED UP LOOKING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS THIS TIME. BUT TO ME, AGGRESSIVE MUSIC AND FLAMBOYANCE ARE AN EXPRESSION OF JOY AND EXHILARATION.&nbsp; THE ARMOR-LIKE OUTFIT MADE OF HORNS, AND THE STRUCTURES THAT LOOKED WRAPPED AND SECURED WERE UNIQUE. DOES THIS ALSO STAND FOR THE PROTECTION AND ISOLATION WHICH ARE THE BASES OF YOUR DESIGNS? IF SO, WHAT WOULD IT BE PROTECTED AND ISOLATED FROM?&nbsp; AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, THE PROTECTION AND ISOLATION WOULD BE FROM CHAOS AND NEGATIVE DISTRACTION. I LIKE PUTTING THE IDEA OF DISCIPLINE, STILLNESS AND LOGIC OUT THERE&mdash;I WONDER IF I DO. THE HORN PIECES WERE ACTUALLY MY INTERPRETATION OF SEQUINS. BUT SEQUINS BY LE CORBUSIER OR BRANCUSI.&nbsp; YOUR CLOTHING LOOKS DIFFICULT BUT IS ACTUALLY VERY EASY AND WEARABLE. I HEARD THAT THEY ARE ALREADY GETTING BACK POSITIVE RESPONSES IN KOREA. HOW MUCH DO YOU GIVE CONSIDERATION TO THE COMMERCIAL PARTS?&nbsp; I WANT MY CLOTHES TO BE WORN. I WANT THEM TO BE A VIABLE OPTION, NOT A CONCEPTUAL INDULGENCE. BEING ABLE TO SLIGHTLY CHANGE HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT DRESSING IN EVERYDAY LIFE IS SO MUCH MORE PROFOUND TO ME THAN MAKING THINGS TO ONLY WEAR ONCE.&nbsp; ALTHOUGH YOUR PIECES ARE WEARABLE, IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY WOMEN WHO CAN REALLY LOOK GOOD IN YOUR CLOTHING. WHICH KIND OF WOMEN WOULD YOU LIKE IN YOUR CLOTHING?&nbsp; I WOULD LIKE MY CLOTHES TO BE FOR EVERYONE.

I HAVEN’T BEEN BACK TO LA IN EIGHT YEARS. NOT FOR ANY PARTICULAR REASON, JUST TOO BUSY AND TOO FAR. AND I’VE BEEN THERE ALREADY. ANYWAY, I EITHER DO LIFE-SIZE SKETCHES AND HAVE A CARDBOARD MODEL BUILT, OR DO SMALLER MODELS TO PLAY WITH AN IDEA. THE ONES TODAY ARE SMALL MODELS WORKING ON THE PRINCIPAL OF THE FEWEST GEOMETRIC SHAPES SLOTTING INTO EACH OTHER TO SUPPORT A SHAPE. THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN BRONZE, STONE AND BLACK LUMBER. I WANT SOMETHING VERY ELEMENTAL AND PRIMITIVE, BUT HORRIBLY, MERCILESSLY MODERN. I’M THINKING OF PIECES I WOULD WANT TO FURNISH A HOUSE BY LUIGI MORETTI OR CARLO SCARPA. THE FURNITURE AND FUR BUSINESSES ARE MY VERSION OF HAUTE COUTURE. IT’S TIME-CONSUMING, LABOUR-INTENSIVE AND RARE. AND IT WOULDN’T HAPPEN WITHOUT THE CULTIVATION OF “THE HUN”. I’M AFRAID I DON’T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO CAJOLE RESULTS OUT OF ALL THE ARTISANS IT TAKES TO CREATE THESE PIECES – THE BRONZE FOUNDRY, THE MARBLE AND ALABASTER ATELIER, THE CARPENTER, THE FURRIER… SHE VISITS ONE ATELIER AFTER ANOTHER AND I’VE SEEN THESE GUYS LIGHT UP WHEN SHE SWEEPS IN, IN THE JEWELLERY, VEILS AND FURS; SHE GIVES THEM MAGIC, AND THEY RECIPROCATE. BUT FIRST, THIS MORNING I HAVE TO GO TO MY STORE IN THE PALAIS ROYAL TO TEST THE SCENT DIFFUSER THAT’S BEEN INSTALLED. I’VE HAD A PERSONAL SCENT MADE AND WANT TO HAVE IT FILL THE SHOPS, BUT FRANKLY, EVERYONE HATES IT BUT ME. IT HAS EASTER LILY, CIVET, EUCALYPTUS AND A MOTHBALL-LIKE PUNGENCY. I ADMIT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CHALLENGING. THE PARIS STORE IS THE SMALLEST, SO THE DIFFUSER GOING THROUGH THE AIR CONDITIONING MIGHT BE TOO INTENSE AND ABSORB INTO THE CLOTHES WHICH MIGHT BE A DIRTY TRICK ONCE A CLIENT TAKES SOMETHING HOME AND WONDERS WHERE THAT AWFUL SMELL IS COMING FROM. THE SCENT IDEA IS ONE I’VE BEEN MULLING OVER FOR A WHILE. I LIKE PERFUME. SCENT IS ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIES OF MEMORY, ALLURE AND DREAMS THAT’S SO TEMPTING TO HARNESS, MANIPULATE AND POSSESS. BUT PERFUME CAN BE A BIG BUSINESS THAT MIGHT TAKE A LABEL FURTHER THAN I’M WILLING TO GO RIGHT NOW. IF IT’S DONE WITH ONE OF THE LARGER FRAGRANCE COMPANIES, THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND PROMOTION MIGHT BE OVERLY ENTHUSIASTIC AND A BIT HARD TO RESTRAIN. NOT THAT I NEED TO LOSE SLEEP OVER IT BECAUSE NO ONE’S ASKING ME. SO I’M JUST PRODUCING IT MYSELF WITH A MASTER PERFUMER IN PARIS WHOSE WORK I’VE FOLLOWED OVER THE YEARS. I HAVE NO DEADLINE OR BOUNDARIES AND HAVE GOTTEN EXACTLY WHAT I WANT. IT’S LIKE SINKING INTO A BEAUTIFUL, DENSE, SLIGHTLY UNHEALTHY GUSTAVE MOREAU PAINTING. WELL, TO ME AT LEAST. DAY 2: APRIL 01 2011 LAST NIGHT WAS AN ART DECO AUCTION AT CHRISTIE’S, AND “HUN” AND I HAD OUR EYE ON A FRANCIS BACON CARPET; ONE OF THE FEW SURVIVING EXAMPLES OF HIS EARLY DECORATING CAREER IN THE EARLY 1930S – IT WAS IN FADED BEIGES AND GREYS WITH A BLACK CUBIST MOTIF AND HAD THE SIGNATURE PARTLY CUT OFF AT THE BOTTOM. I REASONED THAT BACON PURISTS WOULDN’T BE INTERESTED AND THAT DECO COLLECTORS WOULD FIND IT TOO CAMP – I WAS WRONG AND WE WERE OUTBID BY A MILE. AND WE HAD ALREADY FOUND THE RIGHT SPOT FOR IT IN THE HOUSE. THIS MORNING I GOT THE PROOFS OF THE BOOK I’M DOING WITH RIZZOLI. BIG AND HEAVY. I COULDN’T BEAR HAVING ACADEMIC TEXT AS AN INTRODUCTION SO IT’S JUST SCATTERED WITH INTERVIEWS AND A FEW ANGRY BLOG CRITICS’ OBSERVATIONS. MOSTLY IN BLACK AND WHITE, THERE ARE SPORADIC BURSTS OF SATURATED COLOUR TO WAKE UP THE READER. IT’S VERY VALIDATING TO BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE YOUR MISTAKES AND REWRITE HISTORY IN YOUR IDEAL WAY. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW PHOTOS OF “REAL LIFE” ME IN IT, AND ABOUT AS MANY AS THE “UNREAL” ME. LET ME EXPLAIN. WHEN WE FIRST BOUGHT THE HOUSE WE LIVE IN IN PARIS SOME YEARS AGO, I HAD A WAX FIGURE OF MYSELF MADE AS A PERSONAL PORTRAIT OVER THE FIREPLACE EXPERIENCE. I FELT AS IF I HAD TO RECORD THE MOMENT IN A VERY CLASSICAL WAY. I WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE IMPLICATIONS INVOLVED – TRYING TO CLUTCH A MOMENT OF GLORY THAT WOULD BE ALL TOO BRIEF IN A SELF-ABSORBED MORBID EXAMINATION OF MY OWN MORTALITY. I ALSO HAD IT SHIRTLESS AND URINATING, OF COURSE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT BECAME TIRESOME SEEING IT IN THE HOUSE AND SO I HAD IT INSTALLED IN THE PARIS STORE WHICH WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL AND NEEDED A DISTURBING ELEMENT. AS WE OPENED MORE STORES, IT BECAME WEIRDLY ESSENTIAL FOR EACH STORE TO HAVE ONE. LONDON HAS A SEVERED HEAD ON A PLINTH IN HONOUR OF OSCAR WILDE’S SALOME, KOREA’S HAS JETS OF AIR MAKING THE HAIR FLY AROUND AND JAPAN’S IS ON THE WAY. THE STORE IN TOKYO HAS BEEN OPEN FOR TWO YEARS BUT THIS FIGURE TOOK A WHILE. FOR SOME REASON, IT TOOK THE ARTISANS A COUPLE OF TRIES TO GET THE CORRECT FACIAL TEXTURE AND THE RIGHT IRIS SIZE IN THE EYES. THE TORSO IS SHIRTLESS AND MORPHS INTO A DISTORTED MONSTER LEG ENDING IN A CLAW, INSPIRED BY GODZILLA. OF COURSE, I’M HAVING IT RECALLED AND REGRET I EVER THOUGHT OF IT. DAY 3: APRIL 02 2011 LAST NIGHT WE WENT TO THE ARTPARIS OPENING IN THE GRAND PALAIS. IT WAS PACKED AND, OF COURSE, LOOKING AT THE ART WAS INCIDENTAL. I JUST ENJOY THE PAGEANTRY AND THE OCCASION OF BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD IN THE GRAND PALAIS. IT’S A GROWN-UP MOSH PIT. WHAT ESPECIALLY DELIGHTS ME IS KNOWING THAT WHILE THE CROWD IS SWANNING AROUND UNDER THE GLASS DOMES, ON THE ROOF, SWARMS OF BEES ARE MAKING HONEY IN THE HIVES THAT ARE INSTALLED THERE. BEEHIVES ARE ALSO INSTALLED ON THE ROOF OF THE OPÉRA GARNIER. ISN’T THAT KIND OF ENCHANTING? TODAY, HUN AND I WENT TO THE MUSÉE BOURDELLE TO SEE THE MADAME GRÈS EXHIBIT BEING SHOWN THERE. GOOD IDEA, SHOWING ALL THOSE DRAPED GODDESS DRESSES IN MUTED AND FRAGILE SILK JERSEY IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THOSE MONUMENTAL HEROIC BRONZE FIGURES. CAROLINA HERRERA WAS THERE AS WELL, LOOKING VERY LOVELY AND ELEGANT. THE LAST TIME WE WERE AT THE MUSÉE BOURDELLE WAS FOR THE REVILLON SHOW I DID IN 2004. I REMEMBER THE RUNWAY CIRCULATION BEING A BIT TRICKY AND A LOT OF THREADBARE CORDUROY AND FOX. AND SUICIDE DOING CHEREE AS THE SOUNDTRACK. OH, AND REALLY GREAT ALLIGATOR BOOTS. BEING THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT REVILLON, THE FRENCH FUR MAISON FOUNDED IN 1723, WAS A WONDERFUL LARK THAT JUST DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH HORSEPOWER TO LAST. I LEARNED A LOT, THOUGH, AND LOOKING BACK, IT SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN ME CREDIBILITY WITH PARISIANS THAT A YOUNG AMERICAN DESIGNER DECIDING TO SHOW IN PARIS OUT OF THE BLUE MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN OTHERWISE. THE MUSÉE BOURDELLE IS IN THE 15TH ARRONDISEMENT HOUSED IN THE ATELIER AND GARDENS THAT ANTOINE BOURDELLE LIVED AND WORKED IN. MENTORED BY RODIN, HE IN TURN MENTORED GIACOMETTI. I CAN’T UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE WHO WAS DOING NAKED WARRIORS ON TWO-STOREY-HIGH REARING STALLIONS WITH TESTICLES THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD COULD SLEEP IN THE TINY FURNITURE THAT FURNISHED THE LIVING AREA THAT THEY KEEP PRESERVED THERE. IT WAS A DRIZZLY MORNING AND WE WALKED THROUGH THE SHAGGY GARDEN WITH HUGE MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES PLANTED IN BETWEEN THE OLD, RANDOMLY PLANTED BUDDING TREES. BEAUTIFUL. THIS MORNING I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH GERT JONKERS, THE CREATOR OF BUTT MAGAZINE, FANTASTIC MAN AND THE GENTLEWOMAN MAGAZINE. I ASKED IF HE WAS AWARE OF A NEW E-COMMERCE WEBSITE (THAT I SELL TO, INCIDENTALLY) WHOSE FORMAT SEEMED TO ECHO THE FORMAT OF FANTASTIC MAN. HE WAS AWARE AND NOT SO PLEASED. I CAN IMAGINE. BUT IF YOU PROPOSE A STYLE THAT YOU THINK IS A GOOD IDEA AND IT BECOMES INFLUENTIAL, YOU’VE SUCCEEDED, RIGHT? AND IT MIGHT BE UNCOMFORTABLE IF YOU SEE YOUR REINTERPRETED IDEA NOT UP TO YOUR STANDARDS, BUT WOULDN’T IT BE EXCRUCIATING IF IT SURPASSED THEM? HAVING YOUR AUTHORSHIP IGNORED WOULD BE DEPRESSING, BUT IF YOU’RE ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE ORIGINATOR, A GOOD IDEA SPREADING IS JUST INEVITABLE ANYWAY, RIGHT? INSISTENT AS I WAS, I’M NOT SO SURE I CONVINCED HIM. DAY 4: APRIL 04 2011 WEEKENDS ARE USUALLY THE TIME WHEN I CAN REALLY FOCUS. IF THE SUN IS EVEN VAGUELY OUT, I’M ON THE TERRACE, WHICH IS SPECTACULAR RIGHT NOW WITH BLOOMING TREES AND MY FAVOURITE WISTERIA JUST WAKING UP. THE BLACKBIRDS THAT NEST IN THE ROSE VINES UNDER MY OFFICE WINDOW HAVE RETURNED AND TAKEN UP RESIDENCE IN THE SAME NEST THEY USE EVERY SPRING. THIS IS THE TIME THAT I HAVE TO SPREAD OUT ALL MY NOTES AND SKETCHES AND EDIT WHAT HAPPENED THE WEEK BEFORE, AND PLAN FOR THE WEEK AHEAD. IT’S A CHANCE TO HAVE THE DAY TO REARRANGE AND PLAY WITH ELEMENTS OF THE WHOLE PICTURE INSTEAD OF WORKING ON DETAILS AND TECHNICALITIES ONE BY ONE, ONE ON ONE, ALL WEEK. MY “SKETCHES” ARE ACTUALLY BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES OF TOILES THAT I’VE DRAPED ON A MANNEQUIN WITH A FEW BLACK MARKER SLASHES TO SUGGEST THE LINE OR VOLUME THAT I’M GOING TO ADD. I GROUP THEM ON TWO BIG TABLES IN MY OFFICE, ALONG WITH BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES OF THE SHOES, BAGS, FURS, DENIMS AND FURNITURE. THE REASON ALL THE IMAGES ARE BLACK AND WHITE IS FOR A PLEASING UNITY AND TO FOCUS JUST ON SHAPE AND SILHOUETTE. I’M NOT THE GUY YOU REALLY GO TO FOR COLOUR ANYWAY. IT’S IMPORTANT TO SEE EVERYTHING TOGETHER ALL AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WORKING ON ONE GROUP STIMULATES AND SUGGESTS AN IDEA FOR ANOTHER. AND I WANT THERE TO BE A CONSISTENT THREAD TO ALL THE GROUPS AND, EVEN MORE, THROUGH TO ALL THE YEARS. I DON’T HAVE ANY IMAGES ON THE WALLS AND WHEN I HAVE A GOOD EDITING SESSION THAT LASTS ALL WEEKEND, EACH GROUP GOES INTO A SEPARATE FILE, AND THE FILES ARE LAID OUT ON THE TABLES TO REFER TO ALL THE NEXT WEEK. ON SATURDAYS, HUN USUALLY HAS HER WEEKLY LUNCH AT GALERIE JOUSSE, THE GALLERY THAT REPRESENTS THE FURNITURE. THEY REVIEW WHICH PIECES WILL BE GOING TO WHICH COLLECTORS OR WHICH PIECES NEED TO BE READY FOR WHAT SHOWS THAT ARE COMING UP – ART BASEL, THE HONG KONG ART FAIR, ART BASEL MIAMI BEACH, FIAC IN PARIS, AND FINALLY LA IN NOVEMBER. FRANKLY, I LOVE THE SLOWER PACE OF FURNITURE. AFTER HER LUNCH, SHE USUALLY GOES FOR A BOXING SESSION WITH HER TRAINER. I’M FAIRLY STRONG WITH WEIGHTS, BUT IF I HAD TO DO HALF OF HER BOXING SESSION, I’D COLLAPSE IN A SILLY LITTLE HEAP. SHE’S VERY RAGING BULL. TODAY WE GAVE A BRUNCH WITH FRIENDS THAT INCLUDED THE EDITORS OF THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL, SOME/THINGS. THEY DO BEAUTIFULLY BOUND DENSE VOLUMES STUFFED WITH SMART BEAUTY THAT THEY USUALLY GAIN A SURPRISINGLY INTIMATE ACCESS TO. AFTER GETTING TO KNOW THEM AND THEIR INTEGRITY, I AGREED TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO MY STUDIOS AND FACTORIES, DESPITE SOME RESERVATIONS FROM MY TEAM. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE SHY ONES AVOIDED BEING PHOTOGRAPHED, I’M CONFIDENT THAT HAVING RECORDED THIS TIME TOGETHER WILL MEAN A LOT TO US ALL LATER ON. AND IT WAS DONE WITH SUCH AFFECTION AND RESPECT, IT FELT LIKE A GIFT. AND IT WAS. ANOTHER BRUNCH GUEST WAS GAETANO PESCE, THE ARCHITECT AND DESIGNER WHO I’D NEVER MET, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A CONNECTION: WE HAD INHERITED JACEK NOVAK, THE TALENTED CARPENTER WHO STARTED THE FURNITURE COLLECTION WITH ME, FROM MR PESCE. AS A YOUNG MAN COMING FROM POLAND NOT KNOWING FRENCH, JACEK HAD WORKED FOR GAETANO FOR YEARS UNTIL GAETANO DECIDED TO MOVE TO NEW YORK. WHEN WE ARRIVED IN PARIS AND NEEDED SOME WORK DONE, JACEK WAS REFERRED TO US AND EVENTUALLY MOVED IN AND BECAME PART OF OUR FAMILY. JACEK HAS SINCE RETURNED TO POLAND TO OPEN AN ATELIER EXCLUSIVELY PRODUCING OUR FURNITURE, AND RETURNS PERIODICALLY WHEN WE START SOMETHING NEW. HIS FRENCH IS FINE NOW, BUT MINE ISN’T. I CAN’T SPEAK A WORD, REALLY. I WAS SO HORRIFIED THAT I DIDN’T PICK IT UP THE FIRST WEEK I GOT HERE, I JUST DROPPED IT LIKE A HOT BRICK AND NEVER TRIED AGAIN.

ICONIC IN THE FASHION FIELD, HE ALSO CREATES FURNITURE AND WORKS INTENSELY IN CONNECTING CLOTHES WITH A DEEPER METAPHYSICAL AND CREATIVE EXPERIENCE. HIS FURNITURE HAS BEEN WIDELY EXHIBITED UNDER SUCH ENIGMATIC TITLES AS &quot;PAVANE FOR A DEAD PRINCESS&quot; OR &quot;TO POP A BONER.&quot; IN 2007, HE WAS AWARDED THE COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN AWARD. A MONOGRAPH ABOUT HIS WORK HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI. HOW WOULD YOU CONNECT FASHION TO ELEGANCE? EVERYBODY PROBABLY HAS THEIR OWN DEFINITION OF ELEGANCE. PERSONALLY, I’VE SEEN SOME PRETTY TRANSGRESSIVE FASHION THAT WAS ELEGANT IN ITS WIT OR EXUBERANCE. I THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT ELEGANCE IS THE MOST DESIRABLE PART OF FASHION. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF HISTORY AND ART HISTORY IN YOUR CONCEPTION OF FASHION? HISTORY HAS PROVIDED US WITH TOUCHSTONES AND SYMBOLS THAT WE GET TO MIX AND REARRANGE TO CREATE NEW COMPOSITIONS IN FASHION. THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN AT TIMES HIT SIMILAR CHORDS THAT ART CAN. WOULD YOU DESCRIBE FASHION AS A LANGUAGE AND A DISCOURSE, AS BARTHES DID IT? BARTHES WOULD BE A LOT MORE ELABORATE. I LIKE TO THINK OF FASHION AS A QUIET OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND COMMUNICATE. FIRST IMPRESSIONS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF PUTTING YOUR BEST FOOT FORWARD. THE EFFORT TO CHARM IS GENEROUS AND NEVER HURTS. THE WORD &quot;INTELLECTUAL&quot; WAS COINED IN A TIME OF GREAT POLITICAL DISTRESS. DOES FASHION HAVE A POLITICAL ROLE? AND IN WHICH WAY? I THINK FASHION CAN ONLY COMMENT, REACT OR PROTEST. I’M NOT SURE THAT IT REALLY HAS THAT MUCH MORE POWER. HOW WOULD YOU RELATE THE CONCEPT OF &quot;FASHION&quot; TO THE ONE OF &quot;STYLE&quot;? FASHION CAN BE CRUEL. STYLE IS A GIFT TO OTHERS. WHAT DOES FASHION HAVE TO DO WITH INTELLECTUALITY? HOW WE PRESENT OURSELVES CAN BE THE FIRST STEP IN SETTING THE TONE OF HOW WE HOPE TO BEHAVE. YOUR DESIGNS SEEM TO BE BASED ON A CONFRONTATION OF ELEGANCE AND A CERTAIN WILDNESS. WOULD THAT BE A WAY, FOR YOU, TO REDEFINE BEAUTY? THE STORY I’M TELLING IS ABOUT THE BALANCE OF CONTROL AND COLLAPSE AND THE TEMPTATION TO OVERDO EITHER. I LIKE THE IDEA OF IDEALISM, MISGUIDED OR NOT, AND ITS INEVITABLE DEFEAT. I LIKE SELF-INVENTION AND EVEN MORE WHEN IT GOES A BIT MORBID. YOU PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE PRESENTATION OF YOUR COLLECTIONS, WORKING WITH THE SAME STYLIST AND CREATING FASCINATING PICTURES. HOW WOULD YOU RELATE THE CLOTHES THEMSELVES TO THE WAY THEY ARE &quot;STAGED&quot;? WHEN I STARTED, RUNWAY SHOWS WEREN’T IN MY PLAN. I FELT THAT MY AESTHETIC WAS TOO GREY AND NARROW TO ENDURE THE SCRUTINY OF A STATUS- AND NOVELTY-DRIVEN SYSTEM. AND I DON’T MEAN THAT DISAPPROVINGLY. BUT THE OPPORTUNITY WAS PRESENTED TO ME IN SUCH AN IDEAL WAY THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNGRATEFUL NOT TO TRY, AND AFTER A WHILE I GREW TO REALLY ENJOY THEM. I FEEL THAT THE CLOTHES BECOME RELICS OF A CEREMONY THAT WE’VE EXPERIENCED TOGETHER. A HARMLESS CEREMONY TO ENJOY A COMMUNAL MOMENT OF BEAUTY. AND THOSE SHOWS HOPEFULLY CAN GIVE US A PERFECT MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT LIVING UP TO. I REALLY HAVE NO BUSINESS SPEAKING ABOUT RELIGION EXCEPT TO SAY THAT I ADMIRE AND IDENTIFY WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL URGE TO TRY TO BE BETTER THAN ONE IS. ASPIRATION IS A THEME I APPROACH (RATHER LOOSELY ON A RUNWAY) AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE PART THAT ATTRACTS ME IS THE MELANCHOLY OF A UTOPIAN IDEALISM THAT WILL FOREVER INEVITABLY BE OUT OF REACH. UNLESS THERE&#39;S SOMEWHERE I HAVENT GOTTEN TO OR HEARD ABOUT YET, WHICH IS ALL TOO PROBABLE. MOST RELIGIONS AGREE ON LIVING RESPONSIBLY AND HONORABLY WITH DISCIPLINE AND RIGOUR, AND I&#39;M ON BOARD WITH THAT. I DO AGREE THAT BEAUTY CAN BE A PROFOUNDLY MOVING EXPERIENCE, BUT AS A DESIGNER, I CAN ONLY CREATE COMPOSITIONS OF BEAUTY THAT ALREADY EXIST AND SHOW IT AT A NEW ANGLE. WE ALL WANT MAGIC, AND BEAUTY IS THE CLOSEST THING TO THAT THAT I KNOW OF. I DO THINK OF RUNWAY SHOWS AS A VERSION OF A CEREMONY TO ENJOY A COMMUNAL MOMENT OF BEAUTY. THAT SEEMS PRETTY SPIRITUAL TO ME. BUT I THINK THIS APPLIES TO MONSTER TRUCK RALLIES, OPERA, SPORTS AND DANCE FLOORS AS WELL. WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS? I HAVE A LOVELY RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESS: JUST ENOUGH TO BE FLATTERING AND NOT TOO MUCH TO FEEL INVASIVE. CONSIDERING I&#39;M NOT AN ADVERTISER AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE, AND DON&#39;T WORK WITH A PRESS OFFICE, ANY PRESS ATTENTION COMES AS A NICE SURPRISE AND NOT AN ENTITLEMENT. YOUR CLOTHING, YOUR BRAND, YOUR IMAGE ARE ALL INHERENTLY LINKED WITH NOTIONS OF LUXURY. WHAT DOES LUXURY MEAN TO YOU TODAY? I THINK THAT SMART IDEAS EXECUTED WITH QUALITY AND GRACE ARE A PRETTY GOOD INTERPRETATION OF LUXURY. THAT&#39;S WHAT I TRY TO AIM FOR. YOUR PERSONAL STYLE IS A CONSTANT IN SUCH AN EVER-CHANGING INDUSTRY. WHY IS THAT? I DON&#39;T KNOW IF IT&#39;S POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE NEW IN THIS GENERATION TO CREATE AN IDENTITY THE SAME WAY I DID. 10 YEARS AGO, I HAD A LITTLE SPACE AROUND ME FOR THE SECOND IT TOOK FOR ENOUGH PEOPLE TO REGISTER WHAT I WAS ABOUT. NOW, THE DESIGN WORLD IS SO SATURATED, I DON&#39;T KNOW IF IT&#39;S POSSIBLE TO BE ACCEPTED ON YOUR OWN TERMS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SO-CALLED LUXURY FASHION INDUSTRY? DOES IT EXIST, OR IS IT AN ILLUSION? AS LONG AS PEOPLE HAVE A MINUTE TO CONSIDER SOMETHING BEYOND ESSENTIAL NEEDS, THERE WILL ALWAYS, ALWAYS BE A LUXURY FASHION BUSINESS. IT EXISTED LONG BEFORE US AND WILL EXIST LONG AFTER US. YOUR PERSONAL IMAGE IS LINKED TO YOUR BUSINESS PROFILE. WAS THIS A CONSCIOUS DECISION? MY AESTHETIC IS SO PERSONAL AND INTIMATE, IT WOULD BE DISHONEST NOT TO COMPLETELY COMMIT MYSELF. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I ALWAYS WANTED DESIGNERS TO LOOK LIKE THEY MEANT WHAT THEY SAID. OF COURSE THE LONG BLACK HAIR WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS BRAND ME AS THE GOTH DESIGNER, DISCOURAGING SOME PEOPLE FROM ENTERING MY WORLD.BUT AT THIS POINT, I GUESS THAT BOAT HAS SAILED. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GARMENT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT IS SOLD? I&#39;VE ALWAYS ENJOYED ENTERING A CREATOR&#39;S MYTHOLOGY, BE IT IN ART, PERFORMANCE OR DESIGN. SOME OF IT CAN BE FABRICATED, SOME IS LUCK. BUT THE MORE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED ELEMENTS THERE ARE, THE RICHER THE EXPERIENCE IS. AND WHEN IT ALL COMES TOGETHER, IT&#39;S MAGIC. HOW DID LIVING IN CALIFORNIA SHAPE YOUR VISION? I PROBABLY HAVE A CALIFORNIAN&#39;S BLUNT CASUALNESS THAT I USE TO REINTERPRET EUROPEAN COMPLEXITY. AFFECTIONATELY. YOU’RE NOW BASED IN PARIS. HAS THIS CHANGED YOUR STYLE AND HOW YOU VIEW THE WORLD? I&#39;M SURE I&#39;VE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE FRENCH RUNWAY, WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PARIS ITSELF. PEOPLE ARE PRETTY CLASSIC ON THE STREET WHEREAS ON THE RUNWAY, EXTREMITY AND ALMOST PERVERSITY IS ENFORCED VIGOROUSLY. BUT I&#39;VE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTREME ATTRACTION TO THE FRENCH ARTIFICE OF THE TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY WHEN ART NOUVEAU TRANSITIONED INTO ART MODERNE. TO BE IN PARIS NOW IS AS CLOSE TO THAT MOMENT AS I CAN POSSIBLY GET. DO YOUR DESIGNS REFLECT A PARTICULAR CULTURE OR, IN OUR GLOBALLY CONNECTED DIGITAL AGE, DO THEY REFLECT A BORDERLESS WORLD? I TEND TO LOOK AT MY AESTHETIC AS MORE MULTIGENERATIONAL AND HISTORICAL. I THINK OF GREEK CLASSICISM, &#39;30S MODERNISM AND PUNK ROCK. THESE ARE TOUCHSTONES THAT I THINK ANYONE OF OUR GENERATION CAN RELATE TO SOMEWHERE. WHICH DESIGNERS (CONTEMPORARY AND PAST) DO YOU ADMIRE AND WHY? I ALWAYS THINK OF FORTUNY AND VIONNET OF HAVING RADICALLY RELEASED THE BODY AND CREATING AN EASY ELONGATED &quot;DRIPPING&quot; LINE THAT I&#39;VE TRIED TO FOLLOW. I LOVE LOOKING AT CONTEMPORARY FASHION AND USUALLY FIND SOMETHING TO LOVE IN A LOT OF DESIGNERS. I NEVER WEAR ANYBODY&#39;S CLOTHES OTHER THAN MY OWN, THOUGH. ASIDE FROM DESIGNERS, WHO DO YOU ADMIRE? IS THERE SOMEONE IN MIND WHEN YOU DESIGN? FROM WHERE DO YOU DRAW YOUR INSPIRATION FOR FASHION? IS IT TANGIBLE, SUCH AS IN COSTUME OR PERIODS OF STYLE, OR IS IT MORE WHIMSICAL? I&#39;M A BIT TOO CYNICAL AND OLD FOR HERO WORSHIP BUT I DO ADMIRE FIGURES THAT HAVE CREATED AN ALLURE LIKE MARCEL BREUER, JEAN-MICHEL FRANK, EILEEN GREY, CLAUDE PARENT, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT. I TEND TO LOOK AT ARCHITECTURE AS INSPIRATION BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I&#39;M LOOKING AT SOMEONE&#39;S UTOPIAN IDEAL THAT MY CLOTHES MIGHT LIVE UP TO. WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE MEN’S AND WOMEN’S COLLECTION FOR THE UPCOMING SEASON? FRANKLY, I DON&#39;T KNOW UNTIL IT&#39;S DONE AND I REVIEW IT. EACH COLLECTION IS A REFLECTION OF THE ONE BEFORE IT AND THE SHAPES AND FABRICS I&#39;VE ACCUMULATED LITTLE BY LITTLE IN BETWEEN COLLECTIONS. I DELIBERATELY TRY NOT TO OVERTHINK COLLECTIONS; IT USUALLY TURNS OUT BEST IF I LET IT EVOLVE NATURALLY AND WORRY ABOUT INTERPRETING IT LATER. BUT EACH COLLECTION IS ALWAYS ABOUT A DOOMED STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL AND INNER PEACE. I DONT THINK I&#39;VE EVER REALLY DONE ANYTHING SEXUAL. THERE&#39;S ENOUGH OF THAT ELSEWHERE. HOW IMPORTANT IS QUALITY—FABRICATION, MANUFACTURING, PRESENTATION—TO YOUR BUSINESS? I&#39;M CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR FLAWS OR MISTAKES THAT CAN BE INHERENTLY INEVITABLE IN A BUSINESS OUR SIZE. AFTER YEARS OF THIS, IT&#39;S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ENJOY LOOKING AT ANYTHING I PRODUCE WITHOUT BEING HARSHLY CRITICAL. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I HAVE A GLIMMER OF PURE SATISFACTION, BUT IT NEVER LASTS LONG. DON&#39;T GET ME WRONG. I DONT FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF. ITS JUST PART OF THE TERRITORY. DO YOU DESIGN TO PUSH BOUNDARIES AND REVEAL NEW IDEAS, OR TO PLEASE AND TO HAVE YOUR CLOTHES BE WORN? I&#39;VE NEVER REALLY LIKE ART OR DESIGN THAT PREACHES. I USUALLY RESPOND TO THINGS THAT ARE ASPIRATIONAL. ALMOST SUPERNATURAL. I&#39;M NOT SAYING I ACHIEVE THAT BUT I ALWAYS HAVE THIS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND. AND IT WAS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT EVERYTHING I PUT ON THE RUNWAY WAS POSSIBLE AND AVAILABLE FOR SALE. I&#39;VE SLIPPED A FEW TIMES EARLY ON BUT FINALLY LEARNED HOW TO KEEP THIS PROMISE. IS THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING QUITE NATURAL FOR YOU, OR IS IT A CONTINUAL CHALLENGE? I FOUND A PACE OF DEVELOPING MY IDEAS THAT FEELS COMFORTABLE. CHALLENGING BUT RATIONAL. I FEEL THAT EVERY COLLECTION I&#39;LL EVER DO IS THERE INSIDE ME. I JUST HAVE TO UNTANGLE AND REVEAL IT. HOW BIG IS THE DESIGN TEAM/STUDIO? HOW DOES IT OPERATE? I HAVE ONE ASSISTANT FOR EACH DIVISION IN MY FACTORY IN ITALY—FABRIC ORDERS, MEN&#39;S PATTERNS, WOMEN&#39;S PATTERNS, KNITS, DRKSHDW, SHOES AND BAGS. I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S IDEAS SO I&#39;M AFRAID THAT I CAN ONLY BE A DICTATOR. I GO TO THE FACTORY FREQUENTLY TO WORK ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF EACH PIECE. I HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF OF 4 IN PARIS WHERE I WORK BY MYSELF PREPARING AND DEVELOPING IDEAS THAT I TAKE TO THE FACTORY. MICHELE, MY BETTER HALF, RUNS THE FUR AND FURNITURE ATELIERS WHICH I&#39;M NOT ALLOWED TO INTERFERE IN BECAUSE I CAN BE TOO CONTROLLING. THIS IS A COMPROMISE WE REACHED SO SHE WOULDN&#39;T KILL ME. I&#39;M PROBABLY NOT A GREAT HUSBAND AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FATHER. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SPEED OF THE CONTEMPORARY FASHION SYSTEM? I THINK IT&#39;S POINTLESS TO CRITICIZE EVOLUTION AND THINGS MOVING AND INEVITABLY TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE, I USUALLY DELIGHT IN THAT. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT DESIGNER COLLABORATIONS WITH FAST-FASHION GROUPS PISS ME OFF. DESIGNERS DO IT FOR A SPLASHY FLASH OF EXPOSURE, VALIDATING COMPANIES THAT MAKE THEIR MONEY FROM EXPLOITING AND CHEAPENING OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S ORIGINAL IDEAS. HATE IT. YOUR CREATIVE OUTPUT ISN’T LIMITED SOLELY TO FASHION. IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU TO DIVERSIFY AND EXPLORE OTHER FORMS OF CREATION? I LIKE ALTERING EVERYTHING AROUND ME TO CONFORM TO MY AESTHETIC. DOESN&#39;T THAT SOUND AWFUL? I&#39;M AFRAID IT&#39;S HORRIBLY TRUE. I&#39;M A MONSTER. YOU RECENTLY RELEASED A SELF-TITLED BOOK. WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE LIKE OF PUTTING TOGETHER A TOME OF THIS ILK? WHAT WAS THE INTENTION BEHIND IT? I HAD ORIGINALLY PUT TOGETHER MY FAVORITE IMAGERY TO GIVE A QUICK STUDY GUIDE TO NEW EMPLOYEES. WHEN I REALIZED I HAD BEEN MAKING COLLECTIONS FOR 10 YEARS, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO SELF-PUBLISH IT TO SELL IN MY STORES. THIS BOOK WAS CALLED &quot;L&#39;AI-JE BIEN DESCENDU?&quot; WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES TO &quot;DID I DESCEND WELL?&quot;—A FAMOUS LINE BY THE FRENCH SHOWGIRL CECILE SOREL AFTER DRAMATICALLY DESCENDING A STAIRCASE ON THE STAGE OF THE CASINO DE PARIS IN THE 1930S. A FEW YEARS LATER RIZZOLI APPROACHED ME ABOUT RE-RELEASING AN UPDATED VERSION OF IT. IT&#39;S A COMPLETELY PLEASURABLE AND VALIDATING EXPERIENCE COLLECTING YOUR HIGH POINTS AND BLISSFULY DELETING YOUR WEAK ONES TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY CONTROLLED AND PERFECTLY EDITED VERSION OF YOURSELF. TOTALLY FUN. WHAT IS THE GREATEST KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL FASHION BUSINESS? HAVING STRONG PARTNERS. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU PERSONALLY AND FOR THE RICK OWENS BRAND? I&#39;LL JUST KEEP MAKING MY LITTLE COLLECTIONS AS LONG AS EVERYONE LETS ME.

HIS LABEL IS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HIS CLOTHES ACTUALLY SELL – TO MILLIONS OF GOTH-Y FANS AND FANATICS. RICK IS MARRIED TO MICHELE, A FRENCH LADY QUITE A FEW YEARS HIS SENIOR. TOGETHER THEY’RE COMPLETELY EXTRAVAGANT AND FLAMBOYANT. RICK CLAIMS TO BE VERY DEMANDING, UNSOCIABLE AND STRICT, BUT HE’S A SUPER FRIENDLY MAN WITH A HYPNOTIZING, MELODIC VOICE. GERT: I’M GOING TO RECORD THIS ON MY PHONE. RICK: ISN’T THE IPHONE THE MOST AMAZING THING? IT IS. DID IT TAKE YOU A WHILE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT? YES. I’M STILL FIGURING IT OUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE WAY IT COMPLETES WORDS FOR YOU WHEN YOU’RE TYPING? I SWITCHED THAT FUNCTION OFF IMMEDIATELY – IT DROVE ME NUTS. DO YOU USE IT? I HAVEN’T SWITCHED MINE OFF. IT KIND OF AMUSES ME. YESTERDAY IT REFUSED TO SPELL BUTTPLUG. IT CAME UP WITH ALL THESE SUGGESTIONS BECAUSE IT DIDN’T WANT TO SPELL BUTTPLUG. WHY WERE YOU TYPING BUTTPLUG? THAT IS WHAT WE NAMED A NEW PIECE OF FURNITURE. IT’S A BENCH AND WE’RE CALLING IT THE BUTTPLUG BENCH, BECAUSE IT HAS THESE LEGS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY IMPALE INTO IT. I DON’T THINK IT WILL STICK, BUT IT’S OUR WORKING TITLE. HOW FAMILIAR ARE YOU WITH BUTTPLUGS? DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY COLLECTION? I’D LOVE TO. HA, WELL, I DON’T HAVE ONE. ALTHOUGH I DID BUY A BEAUTIFUL BUTTPLUG FOR A CLIENT ONCE – A RUBBER BUTTPLUG WITH A REAL HORSE TAIL ATTACHED TO IT. IT WAS PRETTY FANTASTIC BUT NOT REALLY PRACTICAL, BECAUSE IT’S NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO PUT A TAIL, REALLY. THE TAIL HANGS A LITTLE TOO LOW. YES. THE ANGLE ISN’T AS GRACEFUL AS IT COULD BE. BUT I GUESS YOU HAVE TO MAKE DO; YOU JUST HAVE TO POSE RIGHT. IT’S ALL IN THE POSE. I WAS WONDERING IF A LOT OF YOUR DESIGNS ARE ROOTED IN FETISHISM. I LOVE FETISHES. I’VE BEEN OUT OF CIRCULATION, SO I DON’T KNOW WHAT KIDS DO THESE DAYS, BUT WHEN I WAS YOUNG THERE WAS A PRETTY BIG LEATHER COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES. I’M A LITTLE BIT TOO PRAGMATIC TO LET MYSELF GET INVOLVED IN THE FANTASY OF THOSE THINGS, BUT I LOVED THE CEREMONY AND THE PAGEANTRY AND THE CREEPINESS OF BEING IN A DARK LEATHER BAR AT FOUR IN THE MORNING WITH MUSIC BLASTING AND GUYS JUST STANDING THERE HOLDING A BEER, STARING IN FRONT OF THEM AND DOING NOTHING, EVERYONE WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. THAT TENSION, THAT WEIRDNESS, THE CREEPINESS AND THAT DESPERATION, I LOVED IT. IT’S NOT THAT I COULD PARTICIPATE GENUINELY, JUST BECAUSE I DIDN’T BELIEVE IN THAT WHOLE UNIFORM THING. IS THAT CULTURE STILL AROUND? I WONDER IF THE KIDS STILL NEED THAT KIND OF THING. I MEAN: IT WAS BORN OUT OF SHAME AND…SHAME, WASN’T IT? THAT WAS THE KERNEL OF THE WHOLE BONDAGE DISCIPLINE: OPPRESSION, A MASTER/SLAVE KIND OF THING. I DON’T THINK IT’S PARTICULARLY POPULAR ANYMORE. IT’S KIND OF A VINTAGE FANTASY NOW. IF PEOPLE DO THE LEATHER THING NOW, I THINK IT’S JUST NOSTALGIC. HERE IN EUROPE I NEVER THOUGHT OF PUNK AS A VERY GAY THING, BUT IN LA PUNK AND GAY WERE REALLY CONNECTED, WEREN’T THEY? VERY MUCH SO. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE THAT INTERNATIONALLY. IT WAS A VERY AFFECTIONATE SCENE – VERY COMFORTABLE AND CHARMING. MAYBE IT’S THE COMBINATION OF SUNNY WEATHER AND BEING PUNK? YES, AND HAVING BEER BUSTS OUTSIDE. IN THE ’80S THERE WAS ONE PARTY CALLED THE THEORETICAL, WHICH WAS HELD IN LEATHER BARS, AND IT WAS VERY MIXED – THERE WERE GIRLS AND GUYS. AT LEAST HALF WAS HETEROSEXUAL. IT WAS A VERY HEALTHY THING. THEY HAD BANDS PLAY. THERE WERE ALWAYS A COUPLE OF LEATHER QUEENS IN THE CORNER. THE COCK IN NEW YORK WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT FOR A MINUTE. THEY HAD THE BACK ROOM, BUT THEY HAD GIRLS THERE, WHICH WAS NICE. IT WAS NICE SEEING EVERYONE MIX. IT SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE ’70S, LIKE A STUDIO 54. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE LEATHER SCENE IS THE WHOLE CEREMONY PART: THE SIMPLICITY OF THOSE UNIFORMS, THE DESIRE, THE LONGING, THE ROMANCE. IT’S VERY ROMANTIC. TRYING HARD TO LOOK TOUGH WHEN YOU ARE IN A COMPLETELY VULNERABLE MOMENT. IT’S SUPER VULNERABLE. THAT MIX OF VULNERABILITY AND TOUGHNESS IS IRRESISTIBLE. TOP IT OFF WITH ALCOHOL AND MUSIC, AND IT’S MAGIC! DO YOU EVER DO THAT IN PARIS THESE DAYS? STANDING AROUND IN A LEATHER BAR, DRINKING BEER. NO, THAT’S A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. I DON’T REALLY GO TO PARTIES; I DON’T EVEN DRINK ANYMORE EITHER. BACK IN THE DAYS, THE ONLY REASONS TO GO OUT WERE TO GET WASTED, TO GET LAID OR TO GET NOTICED. I DON’T NEED ANY OF THOSE ANYMORE. I LOVE TO GO DANCING, THOUGH. MICHELE AND I GO OUT TO DANCE, OR WHEN SHE’S NOT IN TOWN, I GO ON MY OWN. I WENT TO THE REX, THIS TECHNO CLUB IN PARIS. IT’S NOT GAY – I MEAN IT’S HALF-GAY; IT DOESN’T MATTER AT THE REX. SO I GET THERE AT LIKE 3 A.M., BECAUSE I KNOW NOTHING IS GOING TO START BEFORE THEN. SO THE BOUNCER IS LIKE: ‘STAND OVER HERE FOR A MINUTE.’ HE KEEPS LETTING PEOPLE IN, AND I’M STANDING THERE. I DON’T SPEAK FRENCH, SO I CAN’T REALLY ARGUE WITH HIM. SO I WALK OVER TO THE PEOPLE WITH THE CLIPBOARD, AND I GO: ‘I DON’T KNOW WHY THEY WON’T LET ME IN. HOW DO I GET ON THE GUEST LIST? WHO DO I PAY TO GET ON THE GUEST LIST? WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO? I LIVE IN PARIS AND I JUST WANT TO COME THIS CLUB AND I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.’ SO FINALLY THEY’RE LIKE, ‘OKAY, GO IN.’ WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? DID I LOOK TOO OLD? WAS IT BECAUSE I WAS A SINGLE GUY AND LOOKED LIKE I WAS GOING TO START TROUBLE? DID I LOOK LIKE A DRUG DEALER? AND ANOTHER TIME MICHELE AND I WENT TO ANOTHER AFTER-HOURS CLUB AND THEY WOULDN’T LET US IN. AND I WAS, LIKE: ‘F CK THIS; I DON’T NEED THIS S IT. LET’S JUST OPEN OUR OWN CLUB.’ SO WE OPENED OUR OWN CLUB. OH, WHAT’S THAT? IT’S CALLED THE SPOTLIGHT. WE DO IT ONCE EVERY SO OFTEN IN THIS RESTAURANT UNDER THE BIG BUS STATION FOR AIR FRANCE ON PLACE DES INVALIDES. IT’S A NICE RESTAURANT, ACTUALLY – ALL BANQUETTES AND CUSHIONS. DIPLOMATS GO THERE FOR LUNCH, AND WE’VE BEEN GOING FOR YEARS AS CLIENTS, SO WE KNOW THEM AND THEY LET US DO OUR CLUB NIGHT THERE. IT’S PERFECT BECAUSE IT’S UNDERGROUND AND YOU CAN MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS YOU WANT. WE DO IT WITH THE GUYS FROM CLUB SANDWICH. IT’S REALLY, REALLY FUN. THE SECOND TIME WE DID IT, WE FLEW IN CHRISTEENE FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS. CHRISTEENE IS INCREDIBLE. SUPER RAW. DO YOU KNOW HER? NO. SOUNDS LIKE I SHOULD. CHRISTEENE’S AMAZING. I WAS LITTLE WORRIED THAT THEY WOULD TONE IT DOWN FOR PARIS, BECAUSE THEY’D NEVER BEEN TO PARIS BEFORE. I DON’T KNOW WHY I WAS SO CONDESCENDING. SO THEY COME OUT, AND SHE’S HOG-TIED AND THE GUYS THAT ARE WITH HER HAVE PANDA MASKS ON. THE FIRST THING THAT THEY DO IS PISS ON HER FACE. AND I THOUGHT: ‘OH GOOD, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE.’ IT WAS MESSY AND AGGRESSIVE AND SMART AND LOUD AND TRASHY AND COMPLETELY POLITICALLY INCORRECT. I HAVEN’T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN PARIS. I MISS THAT. PARIS IS KIND OF STRAIGHT. WHERE DID YOU GET THE NAME THE SPOTLIGHT FROM? THERE IS A FAMOUS CRYSTAL-METH BAR IN HOLLYWOOD THAT MICHELE AND I USED TO GO TO. DOING WHAT? METH? NO, WE DIDN’T DO THAT. SO DO YOU DJ AT YOUR CLUB? OH NO, I’M DANCING! THE WHOLE REASON FOR THIS EXERCISE IS SO THAT MICHELE AND I CAN DANCE FOR THREE HOURS WITH REALLY FUN MUSIC. DANCING IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST EXPRESSIONS OF JOY. IT IS THE EASIEST AND MOST WONDERFUL THING. I THINK DANCING IS FANTASTIC. TOTALLY. BUT TO GET BACK TO THE LINK BETWEEN YOUR WORK AND FETISHISM: I REMEMBER A SHOW FOR WHICH YOU HAD SHAVED THE FRONT OF ALL THE MODELS’ HEADS INTO THIS REALLY AWKWARD HAIRDO, WHICH HAD SOMETHING SADISTIC ABOUT IT, AND SOMETHING I IMAGINE YOU MUST HAVE FANCIED. IT WASN’T BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS SEXY. I THOUGHT THAT BY DOING IT TO ALL THE BOYS IN THE SHOW, THEY BECAME SOME SORT OF CULT. I LIKE THAT WORD: CULT. I DON’T MIND IT AT ALL. I LIKE THE IDEA OF PEOPLE UNIFIED, COMING TOGETHER TOWARDS A CERTAIN ASPIRATIONAL GOAL. WHEN I SHAVED THOSE BOYS, FIRST THERE WAS THE PERVERSE FUN OF GETTING A BUNCH OF PRETTY BOYS AND ABUSING THEM. IT WAS ALSO TO SUGGEST COMMITMENT: I’M PUTTING THEM IN MY UNIFORM AND IN MY CULT. I LIKE THE IDEA OF PEOPLE COMPLETELY SUBMITTING THEMSELVES TO ME. IT’S CERTAINLY NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. I JUST LIKE THE IDEA OF IT – THE IDEA OF SACRIFICE AND ASPIRATION THAT WE DON’T SEE VERY OFTEN IN FASHION. A UNIFORM THAT SUGGESTS SERVICE IS VERY APPEALING TO ME. I HOPE THAT IT DOESN’T COME OFF AS TOO EARNEST. MAYBE THE IDEA OF ABUSE IN GENERAL TURNS YOU ON? I LIKE THE IDEA OF SACRIFICE – I LIKE THE IDEA OF SELF-SACRIFICE AND COMMITMENT. I LIKE THE IDEA OF SOMETHING DEVOTIONAL. ALL YOU WEAR IS BLACK AND MAYBE SOME GRAY? WELL, YES, I ONLY HAVE THIS OUTFIT, TIMES 20. THAT’S ALL I EVER WEAR. IT’S VERY PRACTICAL – IT’S SUITED FOR THE WAY I LIVE MY DAY. I GO TO THE GYM EVERYDAY, SO IT MAKES SENSE TO WEAR MY GYM LOOK. I’M WORKING ALL DAY IN MY HOUSE AND STUDIO AND I’M CUTTING FABRIC AND I’M MAKING THINGS AND I’M GOING TO THE GYM, SO WHAT I WEAR IS WHAT I FEEL IS EXACTLY APPROPRIATE FOR THAT. IT IS VERY RATIONAL. YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS THINK SO, BUT I TRY TO BE SOMEWHAT RATIONAL IN THE CLOTHES THAT I PROPOSE, WITH JUST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FLAMBOYANCE. I LIKE 80 PERCENT RATIONALISM, 20 PERCENT FLAMBOYANCE. DO YOU RUN AT THE GYM IN YOUR OWN MASSIVE SNEAKERS? OH, I DON’T RUN. I CAN’T RUN. I WOULD DROP DEAD IN A POOL OF VOMIT IF I WOULD RUN. I JUST WORK OUT AND I WEAR WHAT I’M WEARING NOW, MINUS THE SWEATER. WHEN DO YOU GO TO THE GYM? MORNING, AFTERNOON OR NIGHT? I USUALLY GO AROUND NOON. I’M NOT VERY GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE ALL DAY LONG – IT’S NOT SOMETHING I’M NATURALLY COMFORTABLE WITH. ONE-ON-ONE I FEEL FINE, BUT I REACH A SATURATION POINT MAYBE SOONER THAN SOMEBODY WHO’S A LITTLE MORE GREGARIOUS. I WAS AN ONLY CHILD. I DIDN’T SOCIALIZE MUCH WHEN I WAS YOUNGER; I WAS ALWAYS KIND OF A LONER. IT’S NOT THAT I’M SHY; I’M JUST NOT A TEAM PERSON AND I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO COLLABORATE. I CAN’T HAVE A TEAM OF ASSISTANTS WHO HAVE IDEAS, BECAUSE IT CONFUSES ME. I CAN ONLY BE A COMPLETE FASCIST. THAT’S WHY RICK OWENS IS A ONE-MAN SHOW. I HAVE WONDERFUL ASSISTANCE, BUT IF SOMEBODY CAME HERE WANTING TO BE CREATIVE THEY WOULD WITHER UP AND DIE. THIS ISN’T THE PLACE FOR THAT. I TRIED, AND I JUST COULDN’T DO IT, AND I’VE LEARNED HOW TO ACCEPT WHO I AM. SO GOING TO THE GYM AT NOON AFFORDS ME AN ESCAPE EVERYDAY. IN THE MORNING I GET EVERYTHING DONE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH MY TEAM, THEN I RUN TO THE GYM AND PUT ON THOSE EARPHONES THAT POUND YOUR SYSTEM LIKE NO MUSIC EVER DID BEFORE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. GOD, TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT! EVERY DAY I HAVE THIS GREAT DISCO MOMENT AT THE GYM. NICE. WHAT SORT OF MUSIC DO YOU PLAY AT THE GYM? I HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH. IS IT MORE DISCO OR ROCK? I DON’T LISTEN TO ROCK AT ALL ANYMORE. I USED TO LISTEN TO ROCK ALL THE TIME, BUT NOW IT’S ALL TECHNO-Y AND HARDHOUSE-VOGUE REMIXES. THERE IS NOTHING NEW. I’M JUST TURNING INTO A CRANKY OLD MAN. THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TURN 50. I DON’T LISTEN TO ANYTHING NEW EXCEPT FOR CHRISTEENE. REALLY, I URGE YOU TO GET CHRISTEENE’S MUSIC. IT’S SUPER GOOD AND SUPER FUN. HERE, I’LL PLAY YOU SOME. (RICK PLAYS A CHRISTEENE TRACK.) IT’S SUPER GAY! SUPER GAY, BUT I DON’T KNOW…IT’S WEIRD GAY, BECAUSE IT’S NOT REALLY A DEFINED SEXUALITY. SHE’S PLAYING WITH BOTH. ONE OF HER SONGS IS CALLED TEARS FROM MY PUSSY. IT’S ABOUT WHEN A MAN IS BEATING YOU DOWN AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? THAT’S WHAT SO GREAT ABOUT IT: IT’S NOT ALL ABOUT COCK SUCKING; IT’S ABOUT TEARS FROM YOUR PUSSY, TOO, YOU SEE? IT EMBRACES EVERYTHING. I MEAN, THIS WHOLE GENDER-F CK THING HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE, BUT I LIKE IT THAT IT’S SO ‘EVERYTHING GOES, I’LL F CK ANYTHING’. I ALSO LOVE CAZWELL. I WAS LISTENING TO CAZWELL FOR A WHILE BECAUSE HE DID REMIXES OF THOSE OLD DISCO SONGS LIKE IS IT ALL OVER MY FACE? REMEMBER THAT? IT’S JUST A SUPER CLASSIC DISCO SONG THAT I LOVE. HE RE-DID IT IN A WHOLE NASTY, GAY WAY. IT’S UP THERE WITH DONNA SUMMER. OKAY, SO YOU GO TO THE GYM EVERY DAY AROUND NOON. AND THEN? WHEN I GET HOME I HAVE LUNCH AND TAKE A NAP. THEN I START ALL OVER AGAIN. THIS IS THE WAY I’VE LEARNED TO USE MY ENERGY THE BEST. IT’S A GREAT SETUP; IT’S WONDERFUL. DO YOU ACTUALLY GO BACK TO BED AFTER THE GYM? NO, I TAKE A NAP ON THE SOFA, OR ON A DAYBED, OR IN THE LIBRARY. I LIKE TO TAKE NAPS AROUND THE HOUSE. IT’S REALLY GOOD TO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO LET GO AND LET THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR HEAD. IT IS THE TIME WHERE THINGS HAPPEN. IT’S SUPER USEFUL; I REALLY RECOMMEND IT. THANKS FOR THE TIP. WITH PLEASURE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP YOU WITH? HOW’S YOUR LOVE LIFE? DO YOU HAVE A ROMANCE? I DO, THANK YOU. IS IT YOUR COLLEAGUE JOP? NO, NO. I’M SORRY, I DON’T KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOU. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU’RE A COUPLE AND YOU MAKE BUTT TOGETHER. OH NO, JUST IMAGINE! HOW LONG HAVE MICHELE AND YOU BEEN TOGETHER? TWENTY-ONE YEARS, AND WE ACTUALLY GOT MARRIED THREE YEARS AGO. I ALWAYS RESISTED THE IDEA OF GETTING MARRIED BECAUSE I RESENTED THE IDEA OF BEING CONVENTIONAL. BUT THEN, FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS, IT MADE SENSE. IT WASN’T TO MAKE OUR PARENTS HAPPY OR ANYTHING. I WON’T SAY IT WAS PURELY FOR TAX REASONS, BECAUSE THAT DOESN’T SOUND VERY NICE. WE REALLY LIKE THE COMMITMENT. I’M VERY HAPPY; I CAN’T IMAGINE BEING WITH ANYBODY ELSE. CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING WITH ANYBODY ELSE BUT YOUR PARTNER? NO, BUT IT’S A BIG WORLD OUT THERE. WELL, SURE, YOU LOOK AROUND… YOU KNOW MALES – WE OBVIOUSLY THINK WITH OUR D CKS. I THINK THAT’S BIOLOGICAL. BUT, YOU KNOW, RATIONALLY, IF I SLEPT WITH THAT PERSON, IT WOULD MEAN I WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO THEM AFTERWARDS OR I WOULD HAVE TO AVOID THEM. WHY WOULD I WANT TO PUT MYSELF IN THAT SITUATION JUST FOR A F CK? THAT’S THE DUMBEST THING. IF YOU’VE HAD PLENTY OF SEX IN YOUR LIFE, WHAT WOULD THAT ONE F CK ADD TO YOUR LIFE? IT JUST SEEMS SO DUMB WHEN IT’S JUST ABOUT RECREATIONAL SEX. I CAN’T IMAGINE HAVING A RELATIONSHIP OR A ROMANCE OF THAT COMFORT LEVEL WITH ANYBODY ELSE BUT MICHELE. I ALREADY LOOK FORWARD TO DINNERTIME WITH HER. IT’S GREAT BEING OLD AND MARRIED. YOU’RE NOT OLD. HOW OLD ARE YOU? I’M GOING TO BE 50 IN NOVEMBER. OH WOW, THAT’S A MILESTONE! I GUESS. I FEEL LIKE I’M TOO DUMB TO BE 50. MAYBE YOU’LL BE A KID FOREVER. I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT. WAS THERE A TIME WHEN YOU CONSIDERED YOURSELF MORE GAY THAN STRAIGHT? OH YES. BUT I WAS ALWAYS A LONER. IT WAS A TOTAL SURPRISE TO FIND SOMEONE TO BE COMFORTABLE AND HAVE A PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH. IT’S STILL A SURPRISE. MICHELE IS PRETTY UNUSUAL HERSELF, SO IT’S KIND OF A MIRACLE. I ACTUALLY CAN’T IMAGINE LIVING WITH A GUY. I DON’T KNOW WHY. WOULD YOU FIND IT BORING TO BE WITH A MAN? TOO MUCH LIKE YOU? IS THAT IT? BUT THEN AGAIN I CAN’T IMAGINE LIVING WITH A WOMAN EITHER. WHAT WOULD BE STRANGE ABOUT LIVING WITH A GUY? I DON’T KNOW. I’VE NEVER TRIED IT. I NEVER ACTUALLY LIVED WITH ANYBODY BEFORE MICHELE, SO I HAVE NO REFERENCES. SHE HAD TWO HUSBANDS BEFORE ME, AND LORD KNOWS HOW MANY MORE BOYFRIENDS, BUT I NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP BEFORE HER. SHE’S BEEN THE ONLY ONE FOR ME. THAT’S KIND OF BIZARRE, ISN’T IT? IT’S INCREDIBLE. I’M NOT COMPLAINING. I’VE HAD A LOT OF LOOSE RELATIONSHIPS. VERY, VERY LOOSE. LOOSE IN TERMS OF ONE-NIGHT STANDS? MORE LIKE ONE-QUARTER-HOUR STANDS. WOULD YOU EVER GO BACK TO BEING GAY? WHEN I’M 80? WHEN MICHELE LEAVES ME FOR SOMEBODY YOUNGER? IS THAT A SERIOUS QUESTION? IT IS, BUT YOU DON’T HAVE TO ANSWER. IS IT ABOUT STIMULATION? I’VE HAD PLENTY OF STIMULATION. I’M MORE SATISFIED NOW THAN WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A LOT MORE STIMULATION. I’M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I’VE FOUND A LEVEL OF PEACE AND COMFORT. I’M DEFINITELY A LOT FURTHER AHEAD THAN WHEN I WAS 30. I MEAN, AT 50 YOU’D BETTER BE, OR ELSE YOU’RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. I’M NOT SAYING I’VE GOT MY S IT ALL TOGETHER, AND I HAVE A LOT TO IMPROVE, BUT THAT’S WHAT WE GET TO DO IN LIFE. ASPIRATION, SELF-SACRIFICE, DEVOTION. HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE YOURSELF? I THINK IT’S WEIRD THAT I’VE NEVER LEARNED FRENCH AT ALL. I’VE BEEN HERE FOR TEN YEARS NOW. WHAT’S HOLDING YOU BACK? WHEN I MOVED HERE I THOUGHT I’D BE BRILLIANT AND PICK IT UP REALLY FAST, BUT THEN I WAS HORRIFIED IN THE FIRST WEEK. IT WAS SO CRUSHING THAT IT DIDN’T COME NATURAL THAT I NEVER TRIED AGAIN. MICHELE DOESN’T MAKE IT EASIER EITHER. YOU KNOW, SHE’S A MEAN FRENCH WOMAN, AND WHEN I MISPRONOUNCE SOMETHING THERE’S A LOOK OF DISGUST ON HER FACE – IT’S SO MEAN THAT I’M DISCOURAGED FROM TRYING ANYMORE. IT’S TOO TEDIOUS FOR HER TO TEACH ME. SHE HAS NO PATIENCE FOR IT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT HER. YOU DON’T SPEAK FRENCH, BUT YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND IT EITHER? NO, WHICH IS SOMETHING I QUITE ENJOY. NOT KNOWING WHAT PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE SAYING AFFORDS ME A LAYER OF PRIVACY. I JUST SHUT OFF. I LIVE IN A LITTLE BUBBLE AND IT’S GREAT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE LIVING A BIT ISOLATED. IS RICK OWENS YOUR FULL NAME OR ARE YOU RICHARD? I’M RICHARD SATURNINO OWENS. AS IN THE PLANET SATURN? YES. IT’S A NAME THAT RUNS IN THE FAMILY. IT MEANS MORBID, OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO MORBID, WHICH WOULD KIND OF APPLY. IT WAS MY DAD’S IDEA TO CALL ME SATURNINO AFTER AN UNCLE OR SOMETHING, SO HE CURSED ME WITH THAT NAME. IT STUCK, AND IT DID WHAT IT DID TO ME. WHAT AN AMAZING NAME. YEAH, IT’S FUNNY. YOU NEVER USE IT? OH, PLEASE! A DIFFUSION LINE CALLED SATURNINO. OH GOD, COULD YOU IMAGINE? I LOVE YOUR HAIR, BY THE WAY. I KEEP BEING AMAZED BY IT. THAT IT’S STILL HANGING ON? IT’S PRETTY MUCH ALL CHEMICALS BY NOW. WHEN I WAS A KID I WANTED TO HAVE CHER’S HAIR. I WANTED TO HAVE WASHBOARD ABS AND LONG BLACK INDIAN CHER HAIR. BUT I WAS A CHUBBY, PEAR-SHAPED KID WITH LITTLE-GIRL TITS AND BUCKTEETH AND BROWN CURLY HAIR. MY HAIR IS REALLY CURLY. I WAS REALLY VERY DIFFERENT – I’VE CHANGED IT ALL. MY HAIR WOULD BE ALL WHITE NOW. HOW DO YOU STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR? I GO TO LONDON EVERY THREE MONTHS TO THIS PLACE THAT DOES THIS JAPANESE CHEMICAL TREATMENT. IT TAKES THREE HOURS. IT’S CHEMICALS, DRYING, CHEMICALS, STRAIGHTENING, CHEMICALS – IT’S COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS. THERE ARE A FEW PLACES IN PARIS THAT DO IT NOW, BUT I’M SO USED TO GOING TO LONDON FOR IT, IT’S LIKE A CEREMONIAL TRIP. IT’S A GOOD METAMORPHOSIS. OH, AND IT’S CHANGED MY LIFE. I USED TO GET IT DONE IN LA. THEY USED TO DO IT AT FRED SEGAL. IT’S FANTASTIC: YOU DON’T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO IT; YOU JUST HAVE TO WASH IT AND GO. I DON’T REALLY LIKE TO DICK AROUND WITH BEAUTY THINGS. I DON’T LIKE CREAMS; I KIND OF HATE ALL THAT S IT, SO THIS HAIR IS PERFECT. YOU JUST BRUSH IT IN THE MORNING? I DON’T EVEN DO THAT. I DO HAVE TO COMB IT THROUGH, BECAUSE IT HAS GOTTEN REALLY THIN. I HAVE BIG WADS OF HAIR THAT I TAKE OFF MY COMB. I SAVE IT, BECAUSE THERE IS SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL VOODOO THING ABOUT SAVING YOUR HAIR. WHEN WE FIRST MOVED TO PARIS, PEOPLE AROUND US STARTED HAVING BABIES. WHENEVER ANYONE WOULD HAVE A BABY, I WOULD GIVE THEM A BABY BLANKET AND I WOULD EMBROIDER THE BABY’S INITIALS WITH MY AND MICHELE’S HAIR. BUT NOW EVERYBODY IS HAVING BABIES LEFT AND RIGHT, AND I CAN’T KEEP EMBROIDERING BABIES’ INITIALS. I DID IT WITH THE FIRST FOUR AND THAT WAS IT; NOW THEY’RE JUST BREEDING LIKE RABBITS. THERE’S TOO MANY GODDAMN BABIES. YOU HAVE TO STOP SOMEWHERE; YOU HAVE TO DRAW A LINE. RIGHT. ALL THOSE GODDAMN BABIES. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME. THANK YOU, THAT WAS VERY PLEASANT. IT’S AN HONOR. WE STARTED WITH BUTTPLUGS AND ENDED WITH BABIES. ISN’T THAT THE WAY?

TEAM SPORTS AND PHYSICAL COORDINATION WERE A BIG SOURCE OF SHAME FOR ME IN GROWING UP SO OF COURSE THEY ALWAYS HAD THE ALLURE OF THE UNATTAINABLE. AND I HADN&#39;T LEARNED HOW TO REBEL YET. BY THE TIME I DID, I WAS TOO OLD TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN MY MOTOR SKILLS AND IT WAS TIME FOR DRUGS. I LOVE THE AESTHETIC ECONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE OF A SIMPLE BOARD WITH WHEELS AND THE WHOLE WORLD AS AN AVAILABLE SURFACE. AND THE JOYFUL RECKLESS VIRILITY OF HAVING NO RULES. I LIKE HOW THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOOK TO MATCH; SIMPLE LOOSE T-SHIRTS AND BAGGY SHORTS SOMETIMES OVERSIZED TO ALMOST KABUKI PROPORTIONS. HUMBLE AND OPULENT LIKE A MONKS ROBES. I&#39;VE USED THIS. THE SKATEBOARD RAMPS THAT I SAW IN MY YOUTH WERE SIMPLE, PRIMITIVE DO-IT-YOURSELF LANDSCAPES MADE OF CURVING PLYWOOD, OFTEN ROUGHLY PAINTED BLACK. LIKE AN OUTDOOR LEATHER BAR. THEY HAD THE SIMPLE BRUTAL RATIONALIST POETRY OF AN ANGULAR BRANCUSI. OR MORE RECENTLY IN MY EYES, THE ARTIST OSCAR TUAZON. ANGLES SUGGEST TRANSITION FROM ONE LEVEL TO THE NEXT. ASCENSION OR DESCENT. A MOMENT OF AMBIGUITY AND EXPECTATION. THE ETERNAL CYCLE OF CRAWLING FROM NOTHING TO THE PEAK OF ALL YOUR STRENGTH AND THEN FEELING YOUR STRENGTH GRADUALLY FADE AWAY TO NOTHING AGAIN. BIAS CUTTING HAS BEEN ONE OF MY MAIN TECHNIQUES IN MAKING CLOTHES. THE GARMENT IS CUT WITH THE FIBRES CROSSING THE BODY AT 45-DEGREE ANGLES, CAUSING THE FABRIC TO CLING TO THE FORM IN A GENTLE WAY. I LIKE THE IDEA THAT BIAS CUTTING IS REFERRED TO AS CUTTING AGAINST THE GRAIN. &quot;AGAINST THE GRAIN&quot; WAS ALSO THE TITLE OF A BOOK BY J.K. HUYSMANS THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME IN MY FORMATIVE YEARS, ABOUT A RECLUSIVE, NEUROTIC AESTHETE THAT SHUTS HIMSELF OFF FROM THE WORLD TO COMPLETELY INDULGE HIMSELF IN SENSATION AND BEAUTY. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY REASSURING TO ME IN HIS EXAMPLE. I ALSO FELT A SATISFYING CLICK OF RECOGNITION WHEN I FOUND A BOOK BY THE ARCHITECTS CLAUDE PARENT AND PAUL VIRILIO TITLED &quot;THE FUNCTION OF THE OBLIQUE.&quot; THE ARCHITECTURE THEY PROPOSED LOOKED LIKE THE SPACES I&#39;D WANTED TO LIVE IN ALL MY LIFE. AND THEY RESEMBLED THE ANGLES AND CURVES AND SLOPES OF SKATEBOARD PARKS. I KEEP THIS BOOK STOCKED IN ALL MY STORES. EVERYONE RESPONDS TO A RATIONAL GRACEFUL LINE. AND THERE&#39;S SOMETHING SO APPEALING ABOUT THE IDEA OF SWOOPING AND SOARING ALONG ONE. ADD THE ELEMENT OF RISK, AND IT&#39;S IRRESISTABLE. THE FURNITURE IS A VERY POWERFUL ECHO OF YOUR AESTHETIC. CAN YOU BOIL DOWN HOW YOU’VE ACHIEVED THAT? IS IT HEFT, SHAPE, MATERIAL? I&#39;M SHAMELESSLY MIMICKING BRANCUSI AND LE CORBUSIER. IN FURNITURE AND CLOTHES. I LIKE A BLUNT RATIONAL SIMPLICITY IN RAW SIMPLE MATERIALS. AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, A SLIGHTLY RIDICULOUS FLOURISH. WHAT DID YOU LOOK AT IN TERMS OF REFERENCES/INSPIRATIONS FOR THE PIECES? I ALWAYS LIKED RUHLMANN, MALLET-STEVENS AND JEAN-MICHEL FRANK. I OVERSIZED AND SIMPLIFIED THEIR SILHOUETTES WITH A HINT OF CALIFORNIA SKATE PARKS AND LEATHER BAR INTERIORS AND VOILA. THIS &#39;30S GLAMOUR ROUGHLY SKETCHED IN LEATHER AND OLD T-SHIRTS WAS MY ORIGINAL BLUEPRINT FOR THE CLOTHES AS WELL. DID YOU DESIGN WITH YOUR OWN SPACE IN MIND? I&#39;VE LEARNED THAT BEING SELFISH IS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY WORKS FOR ME. IF IT&#39;S SOMETHING I GENUINELY DESIRE, IT&#39;S A GOOD BET THAT OTHERS WILL, TOO. OUR GENERATION HAS COMMON TOUCHSTONES THAT WE ALL CONNECT TO. I AM CERTAINLY NOT UNIQUE. ARE THESE &quot;DIFFICULT&quot; PIECES TO LIVE WITH? NOT FOR ME. I&#39;VE GOT MORE UPHOLSTERY GOING ON THAN SOME MAY THINK. CAN YOU FORESEE A DAY WHEN YOU MIGHT CREATE A COMMERCIAL RANGE OF FURNITURE RATHER THAN EDITION PIECES? I&#39;VE REALIZED THAT THE FURNITURE IS MY VERSION OF COUTURE. IT&#39;S TIME CONSUMINGLY ARTISINALLY MADE IN A MIX OF BASE AND RARE MATERIALS. AND THE PROCESS IS SUCH A PLEASURABLE PART OF IT. I&#39;M AFRAID THAT I LIKE INFECTING THE MOST MUNDANE THINGS WITH MY AESTHETIC. LIKE CAST BRONZE SWITCHPLATE COVERS OR PATE DE VERRE TOILETS. THOSE ARE ON MY LIST NEXT. THE CLOTHES SATISFY MY COMMERCIAL URGES. THE FURNITURE IS PROBABLY GOING TO JUST GO MORE EXTREME. WHAT OTHER DESIGNERS DO YOU MIX—IF ANY—WITH YOUR OWN INTERIOR? VINTAGE/MODERN? THE MOST RECENT THINGS I&#39;VE GOTTEN ARE A GEORGE HOENTSCHEL TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY MONUMENTAL URN, A PAIR OF CONSTRICTER LAMPS BY ROLF SACHS AND A SET OF GOLD ALUMINUM PROUVE DOORS. HOW IMPORTANT IS COMFORT WHEN IT COMES TO FURNITURE? I’M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN YOUR BED. THERE’S SURELY NO PIECE OF FURNITURE THAT WE CONNECT WITH MORE THAN A BED. WHAT MOOD DID YOU STRIVE FOR? WHAT WERE THE INSPIRATIONS FOR IT? ORIGINALLY I HAD DONE THAT SHAPE IN MY HOLLYWOOD STUDIO THAT WAS A LIKE A CONCRETE BUNKER LINED IN ARMY BLANKETS. KIND OF ART DECO BEUYS. I DUPLICATED IT IN PARIS. BUT THE NEXT BED HAD TO BECOME A BIT MORE FORMAL. THE ALABASTER HAD A WARMER BIBLICAL QUALITY AS OPPOSED TO MARBLE SO IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. HOW DOES OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DESIGN AND FURNITURE DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS GENERATIONS? I HAVE NO IDEA.

AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK INSIDE HIS PARIS HOME. IN A SALON WHERE SUBJECTS LIKE UNIVERSAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ONCE HELD CENTER STAGE—A ROOM GROANING WITH ELABORATE BOISERIE, INLAID MIRRORS AND PARQUET FLOORING—A TAXIDERMIC MONKEY NOW LOOMS OVER A MASSIVE STONE-GRAY TABLE. RICK OWENS, THE ICONIC EXPATRIATE AMERICAN DESIGNER, HAS TAKEN UP RESIDENCE IN THE FORMER FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS ON THE PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON, A FEW BLOCKS SOUTH OF THE SEINE. &quot;THE BUILDING WAS EMPTY FOR 20 YEARS BEFORE WE GOT IT IN 2004. IT WAS HIDEOUS: OFFICE CUBICLES, INSULATION TILES, A REAL RAT WARREN. I THINK IT WAS TOO DAUNTING FOR MOST PEOPLE TO TAKE ON—NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE WOULD DO IT THE WAY WE DID,&quot; OWENS SAYS, EXPLAINING THAT HE &quot;JUST RIPPED THINGS OUT, BUT LEFT THE CONCRETE FLOORS AND SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF—THE BARE BONES ARE GOOD.&quot; IF A HOUSE IN NEED OF A TOTAL (OR, IN THIS CASE, ARTFULLY PARTIAL) RENOVATION SUITS OWENS, IT MAY BE BECAUSE IT CONFORMS TO HIS PARTICULARLY UNORTHODOX ARTISTIC VISION, A LOVE OF POLISHED IMPERFECTION THAT INFORMS THE CLOTHING THAT HAS MADE HIM FAMOUS—A MODE OF DRESSING (AND, MORE RECENTLY, HOME FURNISHINGS) THAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS HIGH-END, GLAMOROUS GRUNGE. (OWENS HIMSELF HAS CALLED IT &quot;GLUNGE.&quot;) THESE CREATIONS HAVE MESMERIZED THE FASHION WORLD SINCE HE LAUNCHED HIS FIRST COLLECTIONS IN THE EARLY &#39;90S, GROWING INTO A GLOBAL PHENOMENON BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF SKINNY LEATHER BIKER JACKETS BELOVED BY EVERYONE FROM TEENAGERS (WHO ADMITTEDLY HAVE TROUBLE SCRAPING TOGETHER ENOUGH BABYSITTING MONEY TO PURCHASE THE ORIGINAL) TO CUSTOMERS OWENS PROUDLY DESCRIBES AS &quot;FIERCE GRANNIES.&quot; AMONG THE OTHER CODES OF THE HOUSE ARE A WILLINGNESS TO TREAT SABLE WITH AN IRREVERENCE USUALLY RESERVED FOR SWEATSHIRTS AND THE EMPLOYMENT OF TRUMPET SKIRTS AND NARROW TROUSERS DEDICATED TO ELONGATING THE BODY. VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IS MADE IN A PALETTE THAT A FORMER ASSOCIATE LIKENED TO THE COLOR OF A DYING BIRD. OWENS, WHO WAS BORN IN 1961 IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, CAME TO PARIS WITH HIS THEN-PARTNER, NOW WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, IN 2003, WHEN HE WAS HIRED AS CREATIVE DIRECTOR AT RÉVILLON FURS. HE MET LAMY IN LOS ANGELES IN THE LATE &#39;80S. HE HAD BEEN STUDYING TO BE A PAINTER AT THE OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN BUT SWITCHED TO PATTERN-MAKING; LAMY, ORIGINALLY FROM PARIS, HAD A SPORTSWEAR FACTORY AT THAT TIME AND EMPLOYED HIM. TODAY, SHE IS HIS MUSE, HIS GODDESS, HIS ARTISTIC OTHER-HALF, THE FORCE BEHIND HIS FUR AND FURNITURE LINES AND, BY DEFAULT, HIS TRANSLATOR. &quot;MY FRENCH IS STILL NONEXISTENT,&quot; HE LAUGHS RUEFULLY. &quot;I AM SO HORRIFIED I DIDN&#39;T PICK IT UP EASILY. I LIVE WITH A MEAN FRENCH LADY, AND WHEN SHE HEARS MY FRENCH SHE CAN REALLY GIVE ME A LOOK OF DISDAIN.&quot; THOUGH HE REMAINS A QUINTESSENTIALLY AMERICAN GUY—SOFT-SPOKEN BUT STRONG-MINDED, A LONG-HAIRED, LOUCHE, SUPER-FASHIONABLE VERSION OF GARY COOPER—OWENS, LIKE SO MANY AMERICAN ARTISTS BEFORE HIM, IS BESOTTED WITH PARIS, THRILLED TO THINK THAT MONTESQUIEU AND PROUST TROD THE VERY SAME COBBLESTONES HE CROSSES EVERY DAY. GAZING OUT A WINDOW AT THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE GARDEN AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE, HE DREAMILY OBSERVES, &quot;ON DAYS WHEN THERE ARE VISITING DIGNITARIES REVIEWING THE TROOPS THERE&#39;S A LITTLE BAND THAT PLAYS THE MARSEILLAISE. IT&#39;S SO SWEET.&quot; THIS LEFT BANK BUILDING, WHOSE GLORIOUS FRONT ROOMS DATE FROM THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, BUT WHOSE BACK AREA IS AN UNIMPRESSIVE ADDITION FROM THE &#39;50S, SERVED UNTIL RECENTLY AS OWENS&#39;S ENTIRE HEADQUARTERS AND LIVING SPACE. A FEW MONTHS AGO HE MOVED HIS SHOWROOM TO ANOTHER PARIS LOCATION, BUT THE FURNITURE DESIGNING STILL TAKES PLACE HERE. THE FUR DEPARTMENT REMAINS IN SITU, WITH A SECOND-FLOOR ATELIER FEATURING A CURTAIN OF MINK PELTS DRYING OVERHEAD, AN EVISCERATED BEAR DRAPED OVER A CHAIR—PURELY AS DECORATION, OWENS CONFIDES—AND A RACK OF RARE PYTHON BIKER JACKETS, TYPICALLY OWENS-ESQUE IN THEIR FERAL DECADENCE. (WHO KNEW SCALES COULD GROW THIS BIG?) THIS AFTERNOON, A FEW DAYS AFTER OWENS&#39;S WELL-RECEIVED FALL 2013 RUNWAY SHOW, THE DESIGNER HAS BEEN PERSUADED TO CONDUCT A HOUSE TOUR, CLAD IN HIS USUAL UNIFORM: UNLACED SNEAKERS, SHORTS OVER TROUSERS, A HALTER T-SHIRT ATOP A GARMENT HE CALLS HIS &quot;LEVEL&quot; TURTLENECK (BECAUSE OF THE STRAIGHT LINE ACROSS THE SHOULDER, IN FRONT OF THE THROAT). WE ASCEND THE NARROW WOODEN STAIRS (HE HAS PLANS TO WIDEN THE STAIRCASE, RIP OUT THE CHARMLESS ELEVATOR AND FLOOD THE PLACE WITH LIGHT) AND ARRIVE AT THE LIVING QUARTERS, DECORATED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE FURNITURE THAT OWENS HAS BEEN DESIGNING SINCE 2006. MONUMENTAL AND DRAMATIC—COMBINING THE INFLUENCES OF ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS, DONALD JUDD AND LE CORBUSIER—THE PIECES, THOUGH SPECTACULAR IN AN ART BRUT SORT OF WAY, ARE NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL WARM AND COZY. THEY AREN&#39;T MEANT TO BE—OWENS SAYS THEY ARE THE ANTITHESIS OF HIS CLOTHES, WHICH PLACE A PREMIUM ON SLOUCHY COMFORT. &quot;WITH THE FURNITURE, I COMPLETELY DISREGARDED WHAT&#39;S PRACTICAL—THAT&#39;S ART, THAT&#39;S MAGIC!&quot; IF THE MATERIALS ARE WILDLY AMBITIOUS AND THE PRICES INSANELY HIGH, IF THESE ANTLER CHAIRS AND PETRIFIED BARK TABLES ARE SCALED FOR A TEXAS OLIGARCH OR A MIDDLE EASTERN POTENTATE, OWENS MERELY SHRUGS. &quot;THE FURNITURE STARTED AS A HOBBY FOR ME. I MEAN, IT&#39;S NOT LIKE I COLLECT CARS OR ANYTHING. IT WAS A PERSONAL INDULGENCE. FRANKLY, I WAS SURPRISED WHEN WE STARTED SELLING IT.&quot; EVEN WHEN THE DECOR IS NOT OWENS-DESIGNED, IT IS HARDLY CANDY-COLORED. ON THE FLOOR OF AN AREA HE REFERS TO AS MICHÈLE&#39;S GYM—&quot;I HATE BOXING,&quot; HE SAYS. &quot;SHE&#39;S INTO CARDIO; I CAN&#39;T DO IT&quot;—IS AN ELEGANT ALL-BLACK BOOM BOX (WORDS THAT DON&#39;T USUALLY GO TOGETHER), A RECENT GIFT FROM CHER, A NEW ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAS BECOME A FAST FRIEND. THE MASTER BEDROOM IS DOMINATED BY A BED THAT IS A REPLICA OF THE ONE THEY HAD IN L.A., A HUMONGOUS CREATION MADE OF FELT-COVERED PLYWOOD, A DESIGN THAT OWENS HAS ALSO RENDERED IN ALABASTER, IN AN EDITION OF TWO. (SHOULD YOU BE CONSIDERING ASKING HIM TO INCREASE THIS TO THREE, BEAR IN MIND THAT IT WILL WEIGH TWO TONS—THE PERSON WHO PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THIS $180,000 ITEM HAD TO HAVE HIS FLOOR REINFORCED.) &quot;HOW DO WE MAKE ALL THE THINGS AROUND US BEAUTIFUL?&quot; OWENS ASKS RHETORICALLY, EXPLAINING HIS INTERIOR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY. &quot;EVERY SWITCH PLATE, EVERY SNEAKER, I WANT ALL THE EVERYDAY STUFF TO BE GREAT. I WOULD LIKE A ROCK CRYSTAL TOILET!&quot; IN LIEU OF A CRYSTAL FACILITY, THERE IS A WONDERFUL LIBRARY, WHICH OWENS REFERS TO AS HIS &quot;PANIC ROOM,&quot; AND FEATURES RUGS REPURPOSED FROM SURPLUS MILITARY BLANKETS. OWENS-DESIGNED SHELVING HOLDS TOMES THAT RANGE FROM SCOTTY BOWERS&#39;S SCANDALOUS MEMOIR, FULL SERVICE, TO A COMPENDIUM OF FELLINI FILMS TO SEVEN BOUND VOLUMES OF INTERVIEW MAGAZINE. &quot;HONEY, ARE YOU DECENT?&quot; OWENS CALLS OUT AS WE APPROACH THE NEXT LANDING, WHERE LAMY IS JUST FINISHING UP IN HER CUSTOM OWENS-DESIGNED HAMMAM. AND HERE IS THE LADY HERSELF, SURPRISINGLY DIMINUTIVE (BIRDLIKE, YOU MIGHT SAY), WITH A WICKED GRIN THAT REVEALS HER TRADEMARK MOUTHFUL OF GOLD TEETH. SHE IS FRIENDLY AND WELCOMING, AND THE TWO OF THEM SEEM LIKE THEY COULDN&#39;T BE HAPPIER, BUT SUDDENLY YOU FIND YOURSELF WONDERING, OK, SO THERE IS A MARBLE HAMMAM AND A BED THAT COULD SLEEP A FAMILY OF 12, BUT CAN YOU GET A CUP OF COFFEE AROUND HERE? THE ANSWER IS NOT REALLY; THOUGH THE WORK AREA HAS A FULL CATERING KITCHEN, THE LIVING QUARTERS DON&#39;T EVEN SPORT A DORM FRIDGE, WHICH OWENS SAYS IS FINE WITH HIM. &quot;WE HAVE MINIBARS ON EACH FLOOR—I CAN ALWAYS GET A COOKIE.&quot; AS IT TURNS OUT, THE COUPLE TAKES MOST MEALS AT THE BRASSERIE LE BOURBON ON THE CORNER: &quot;WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE ANYWAY,&quot; OWENS SAYS. RECENTLY, THEY WERE HAVING DINNER AT THE RESTAURANT WHEN PIERRE CARDIN, STILL DESIGNING AT 90, APPROACHED OWENS AND COMPLIMENTED HIM ON HIS WORK. &quot;I WAS JUST SO TOUCHED, HE&#39;S SO FRENCH!&quot; OWENS REMEMBERS. &quot;IT MADE ME FEEL SO VALIDATED, LIKE I HAD ACHIEVED MAJOR FRENCH ACCEPTANCE.&quot; NOT BAD FOR A CALIFORNIA BOY WITH A SCHOOLTEACHER MOM AND A VERY CONSERVATIVE SOCIAL WORKER DAD, WHO GREW UP IN A HOUSE WITH A LIBRARY THAT CONTAINED VOLUMES OF COLETTE AND HUYSMANS BUT NO TV. (NEVERTHELESS, OWENS WATCHED TELEVISION AT FRIENDS&#39; HOUSES, AND IT&#39;S EASY TO GUESS HIS FAVORITE PROGRAM: THE ADDAMS FAMILY, WHICH WAS CLEARLY A FORMATIVE INFLUENCE.) HIS PARENTS TRAVEL TO PARIS TWICE A YEAR TO SEE HIS WOMEN&#39;S RUNWAY SHOWS, AND EVERY SEASON HIS MOM ASKS IF HE&#39;S EMBARRASSED SHE TURNS UP IN BRIGHT COLORS. (&quot;NO, MOM, IT&#39;S FINE,&quot; HE REASSURES HER EACH TIME.) SHE WAS AT HIS MOST RECENT SHOW IN FEBRUARY, WHICH OFFERED ASIAN-INSPIRED WOMEN WARRIORS MARCHING TO A WAGNER SOUNDTRACK, THEIR PRE-RAPHAELITE HAIRDOS LITERALLY BLOWING IN THE WIND VIA STEAM MACHINES. OVER LUNCH—THE CATERING KITCHEN SUPPLIES ORANGE JUICE AND MINERAL WATER AND A NEARBYBIO (FRENCH FOR &quot;ORGANIC&quot;) RESTAURANT SENDS OVER DELICIOUS CHICKEN AND COUSCOUS—OWENS TALKS ABOUT HIS GUIDING AESTHETIC, COMMON TO BOTH HIS FASHION AND HIS FURNITURE. &quot;WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, MY NICHE HAS BEEN AROUND FOREVER,&quot; HE SAYS. &quot;SARAH BERNHARDT WORE A TAXIDERMIED BAT IN HER HAIR! WHAT I AM DOING IS REALLY A REFORMULATION OF EXOTICISM.&quot; WE ARE IN THE ROOM WITH THE MONKEY (FRANCOIS MITTERRAND&#39;S FORMER OFFICE) SITTING ON OWENS&#39;S ALCHEMIST CHAIRS—A TRIANGULAR AFFAIR THAT HE DESCRIBES AS &quot;MEANT MORE FOR PERCHING THAN FOR READING.&quot; (HALFWAY THROUGH THE MEAL THIS BECOMES READILY APPARENT.) THE CONVERSATION TURNS TO THE UNDERPINNINGS OF VIRTUALLY ALL HIS CREATIVE WORK: &quot;IT BOILS DOWN TO CONSTRUCTION, CREATING MY OWN LANGUAGE FROM THE INSIDE OUT, BUT ALWAYS KEEPING MY SIGNATURE,&quot; HE EXPLAINS. &quot;CLOTHES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT EXPERIENCE—THE DAMAGE, THE PATINA, ACCEPTING IT AND ENJOYING IT, MAKING IT PART OF LIFE. WE ALL GET IMPATIENT WHEN THINGS ARE TOO PRIM.&quot; STILL, DESPITE HIS MANY EUROPEAN INFLUENCES—HIS ENTIRE OPUS, HE SAYS, SMILING, OWES A SERIOUS DEBT TO MADAME GRÈS, THE FRENCH FASHION DESIGNER AND MASTER CUTTER, AND EILEEN GRAY, THE AVANT-GARDE IRISH FURNITURE DESIGNER—OWENS&#39;S COLLECTED WORKS AREN&#39;T EXACTLY CONTINENTAL; THEY ARE THE PRODUCT OF AN IMAGINATION THAT RESIDES IN A VERY SPECIFIC RICK-LAND. HIS SIGNATURE IS SO RECOGNIZABLE THAT IT HAS INEVITABLY TURNED UP, MASSIVELY COPIED, IN HIGH-STREET STORES ALL OVER THE GLOBE, BUT OWENS TAKES THIS IN STRIDE, EVEN THINKING OF IT AS A COMPLIMENT, THOUGH HE ADMITS THAT LATELY HE HAS BEEN CONSIDERING HIS LEGACY. HE SAYS HE IS THRILLED TO BE SO INFLUENTIAL, &quot;BUT IF I WASN&#39;T CREDITED, THEN IT WOULD HURT. AND IF SOMEONE WAS DOING IT BETTER THAN ME IT WOULD KILL ME. THERE ARE MOMENTS I WANT TO CLAIM MY SPACE A LITTLE MORE STRONGLY. SOMETIMES I WORRY, WILL I BE A SMALL FOOTNOTE IN FASHION HISTORY?&quot; HE LAUGHS AND THAT GARY COOPER–ESQUE, ALL-AMERICAN MODESTY REEMERGES, ESPECIALLY STRIKING, AND EVEN A LITTLE TOUCHING FROM A GUY WHO HEADS UP A NEARLY $100 MILLION BUSINESS. &quot;I KNOW I SHOULD JUST BE GRATEFUL PAYING THE RENT. I STARTED OUT TO DO WHAT&#39;S COOL AND WHAT AMUSES ME, AND I STILL TRY TO OPERATE LIKE THAT. FOR A LONG WHILE IT WAS ABOUT STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE, STRUGGLING TO GET BETTER. NOW IT&#39;S ABOUT STAKING MY PLACE. Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

PLEASE SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOUR LIFE AND YOUR DESIGN ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER? WHEN I STARTED, I ALWAYS RESENTED HOW DESIGNERS WOULD PRESENT AN IDEALIZED RUNWAY VISION AND THEN COME OUT AT THE END IN JEANS AND A T-SHIRT, DISASSOCIATING REAL LIFE FROM RUNWAY LIFE. I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE THE SAME, SO I&#39;VE ALWAYS TRIED TO PRESENT A VISION THAT WAS EXTREME BUT RELEVANT TO REAL LIFE. NOT TOO SHINY, A BIT DAMAGED BUT ASPIRATIONAL AND SOMETIMES QUIETLY FLAMBOYANT. PEOPLE ALWAYS APPLY TAGS LIKE “DARK”, “GOTH”, “DISTRESSED” TO YOUR DESIGN, DOES IT MEAN THAT’S SOMETHING EXISTING IN YOUR LIFE OR MIND? OR DO THEY JUST REFLECT SOME MEMORIES FROM YOUR EARLY LIFE? MY INTENTION IS TO PRESENT SOMETHING RESERVED, DISCREET AND SOMBER, I SUPPOSE IT’S EASY TO INTERPRET THAT AS DARK. BUT ADMITTEDLY, I&#39;VE ALWAYS ENJOYED A BIT OF GOOD NATURED FEROCITY AND RECKLESSNESS IN MUSIC AND ART SO I GUESS THAT COMES THROUGH. SOME PEOPLE THINK YOUR DESIGN IS WILD, WHILE SOME THINK IT’S ROMANTIC, WHAT DO YOU COMMENT ON YOUR OWN WORK? I&#39;M ACTUALLY TRYING TO JUST DO SOMETHING REALISTIC THAT’S A REFLECTION OF EVERYTHING WE&#39;VE ALL LEARNED TOGETHER. WILDNESS AND ROMANCE ARE A BIG PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE INNER LIVES. WE CAN TELL A VERY CLEAR SIGNATURE OF RICK OWENS FROM EACH OF YOUR SHOWS OR EVEN EACH PIECE, MEANWHILE, WE CAN ALSO FEEL IT CHANGES SLIGHTLY FROM SEASON TO SEASON. HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR MIND AND CONCEPT HAVE CHANGED THROUGH THE YEARS? I LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLOTHES SO I WAS ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF CREATING MY OWN CONSTRUCTION LANGUAGE THAT WOULD IDENTIFY MY CLOTHES AS MINE. IN THE BEGINNING, I WAS ENAMORED WITH POETIC COLLAPSE BUT AS I GOT OLDER I BECAME MORE INTERESTED IN RIGOR AND CONTROL. BUT THIS PURSUIT OF CONTROL COMES WITH THE RESIGNATION OF INEVITABLE FINAL COLLAPSE. FOR THE LATEST COLLECTION, WE CAN SEE YOUR DESIGN SEEMS TO BE BASED ON A CONFRONTATION OF ELEGANCE AND A CERTAIN WILDNESS. WOULD THAT BE A WAY, FOR YOU, TO REDEFINE BEAUTY? THIS IS THE KIND OF BEAUTY I PROPOSE. BUT AS A GENTLE PROPOSAL. NOT A STRIDENT PROCLAMATION. ARE YOU A PERFECTIONIST? WHY? YES, I AM A HOPELESS IDEALIST. THE IDEAL IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE STRUGGLE TOWARDS IT IS GLORY ENOUGH. HOW DO YOU TREAT IMPERFECTIONS BOTH IN LIFE AND IN YOUR DESIGN? AFFECTIONATELY. IF ONE’S DESIGN CAN BE CLASSIFIED BY NATIONALITY, WHAT IS YOUR DESIGN’S NATIONALITY? UNIVERSAL. WHO OR WHAT IS YOUR MUSE? THE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY. BETWEEN MUSIC AND ARCHITECTURE, WHICH INFLUENCES YOU MORE? HOW? PROBABLY MUSIC BECAUSE I&#39;M MORE IMMERSED IN IT PHYSICALLY WHERE THE IMMERSION IS MORE THEORETICAL WHEN IT COMES TO BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE. IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONE KIND OF MUSIC ON A DESERT ISLAND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE OPERA. WHAT INNOVATES YOU TO DESIGN THE FURNITURE COLLECTIONS? I WANTED TO IMBUE EVERYTHING AROUND ME WITH AS MUCH MAGIC AS POSSIBLE– T-SHIRTS, FURS, TOILETS, LIGHT SWITCHES, CHAIRS... MAKING THE MOST EVERYDAY THINGS AROUND ME SPECIAL IS WHAT I LIVE FOR, WHICH COULD BE INCREDIBLY SUPERFICIAL OR INCREDIBLY SPIRITUAL; I&#39;M NOT SURE YET BUT DON’T REALLY CARE. WHY DID YOU MAKE A FULL-SCALE WAX STATUE OF YOUR SELF? DO YOU HAVE THE SAME FEELING WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT NOW AS WHEN YOU FIRST SEE IT? I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AMUSING ALTERNATIVE TO THE IDEA OF COMMISSIONING A CLASSICAL PORTRAIT TO HANG OVER THE MANTEL OF MY HOUSE IN PARIS. IT WAS AN EXERCISE IN VANITY, EGO AND MORTALITY THAT WAS WEIRD, FUNNY AND SAD ALL AT THE SAME TIME. IT WAS ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT IN THE MOST ARTIFICIAL AND DELICIOUSLY CREEPY WAY. BUT HAVING IT IN THE HOUSE BECAME HEAVY (I DON’T REALLY LIKE PHOTOS, PAINTINGS OR PICTURES ON THE WALLS EITHER) SO I PUT IT IN THE PARIS STORE, WHICH WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL AND NEEDED A DISTURBING ELEMENT. NOW IT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME A TRADITION FOR ALL MY STORES TO HAVE ONE. DO YOU HAVE ANY PLAN TO EXPAND YOUR MARKET IN CHINA? YOUR COLLECTIONS ARE QUITE POPULAR HERE, I’M SURE THE CHINESE CONSUMER WILL GIVE YOU A WARM WELCOME. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMEONE ALREADY TRADEMARKED MY NAME IN CHINA AND I&#39;M HAVING A HARD TIME LEGALLY HAVING IT RELEASED TO ME. PLEASE START DEMONSTRATING IN THE STREETS ON MY BEHALF. TO US, YOU HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESS IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL FIELD; DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR CAREER? WELL, I&#39;VE CERTAINLY GOTTEN FURTHER THAN I EVER THOUGHT OR PROBABLY DESERVE SO IF IT ALL ENDED HERE I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF BLESSED WHAT’S YOUR NEXT PLAN, BOTH IN LIFE AND IN YOUR CAREER? I WANT A BIGGER GARDEN. Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

RICK OWENS: I&#39;M DONE. [LAUGHS] GQ: YOU&#39;RE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FEW GUYS WHO MANAGES TO GET IT ALL DONE AHEAD OF TIME, RIGHT? ? RO: YOU KNOW, I&#39;M 50. AFTER TEN YEARS OF DOING THIS, YOU&#39;VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR S IT TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT. AND, I MEAN, I&#39;M NOT SAYING IT&#39;S PERFECT, BUT I&#39;VE DONE THE BEST I CAN, AND NOW I HAVE TO LET IT GO. GQ: WHEN YOU GET DRESSED IN THE MORNING, DO YOU HAVE A VISION OF WHAT YOU&#39;RE GOING TO WEAR THAT DAY? RO: YEAH, I DO. BECAUSE I HAVE TWENTY OF THE SAME THING, I WEAR THE SAME OUTFIT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I CAN&#39;T IMAGINE HAVING TO CHOOSE CLOTHES IN THE MORNING. IT WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY. I MEAN, I FOUND ONE THING I LIKE AND THEN I PROBABLY HAVE TWENTY OF IT. I CHANGE IT A LITTLE BIT EVERY YEAR, MAYBE, BUT IT&#39;S BASICALLY THE SAME THING. IT&#39;S BEEN THE SAME THING FOR A LONG TIME. YOU KNOW, IF IT&#39;S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MR. [AZZEDINE] ALAÏA, IT&#39;S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. GQ: IS THERE A SENTIMENTAL PIECE OF CLOTHING IN YOUR HOME, SOMETHING FROM WHEN YOU WERE A YOUNG BOY? RO: THERE&#39;S A MONKEY COAT, A MONKEY FUR COAT THAT I USED TO WEAR IN MY YOUNGER DAYS THAT MY WIFE MICHELE [LAMY] WEARS NOW, THAT I LIKE TO SEE. THAT&#39;S ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT&#39;S SENTIMENTAL THAT I&#39;VE HAD FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. IT&#39;S A BEAUTIFUL MONKEY FUR COAT WITH KIND OF BIG SHOULDERS. I&#39;M NOT REALLY AS FLAMBOYANT AS I USED TO BE, SO I DON&#39;T, I DON&#39;T WEAR… GQ: IN HIGH SCHOOL, DID YOU HAVE A KILLER PIECE OF CLOTHING YOU HAD THEN? RO: HIGH SCHOOL…YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, AND I DON&#39;T REALLY REMEMBER IT FONDLY, SO I PROBABLY DIDN&#39;T. I REMEMBER LIKING NOT WEARING SHOES FOR A LONG TIME. GQ: REALLY? RO: YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT THE COOLEST THING WAS NEVER TO WEAR SHOES ANYWHERE. GQ: SO WERE YOU LIKE SPICOLI AT THAT POINT? RO: WELL, NOT AS GOOD-LOOKING, I DON&#39;T THINK, BUT I&#39;D LIKE TO HAVE BEEN. I THINK I WAS AIMING FOR THAT. GQ: WHAT INSPIRES YOU MOST? RO: ARCHITECTURE. GQ: ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY THESE DAYS? RO: IT&#39;S NOT CONTEMPORARY. I MEAN, I LIKE VINTAGE THINGS BECAUSE I LIKE SEEING A BODY OF WORK. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT LIKE CONTEMPORARY ART AND PEOPLE THAT LIKE OLD ART, AND I LIKE OLD ART. CONTEMPORARY ART I ENJOY LOOKING AT, BUT I CAN&#39;T REALLY INVEST EMOTIONALLY IN SOMETHING THAT I DON&#39;T FEEL IS A FINISHED STORY, AND WHEN PEOPLE GET EXCITED ABOUT MODERN ART I FEEL LIKE THERE&#39;S AN ELEMENT OF GAMBLING AND STATUS INVOLVED. I LIKE SEEING SOMETHING DONE. THE OLD SPECTRUM OF SOMEBODY&#39;S BODY OF WORK, I LOVE THAT. I LIKE ART FROM THE THIRTIES A LOT. THE THIRTIES AND TWENTIES. I MEAN, IF I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE, I LIKE ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS. I LIKE— WHO&#39;S THAT ONE WHO JUST DIED, THE ONE WHO JUST DIED WHO DID— NO, LE CORBUSIER DID BRASILIA, RIGHT? GQ: NO, THAT WAS THE GUY WHO&#39;S 101 WHO JUST DIED. AND HE DID THE BRASILIA THING. RO: AND HE LIVED IN RIO DE JANEIRO. WHY CAN&#39;T WE REMEMBER? GQ: WHY CAN&#39;T WE? BECAUSE WE&#39;RE BOTH 50 YEARS OLD; WE GET OLD [LAUGHS]. RO: THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. [ED NOTE: OSCAR NIEMEYER IS THE ARCHITECT IN QUESTION.] GQ: IF YOU HAD TO PICK A SONG THAT DEFINES YOU, DO YOU HAVE ONE? RO: WAGNER. IT WOULD BE SCHMERZEN, ONE OF THE WESENDONCK LIEDER FROM WAGNER, AND THAT&#39;S WHAT I PLAYED IN MY LAST WOMEN&#39;S SHOW. I FINALLY USED IT IN A SHOW. AND THAT&#39;S BEEN AN IMPORTANT SONG TO ME SINCE I WAS YOUNG. SO THAT&#39;S THE SONG THAT WOULD DEFINE ME. GQ: HOW DID IT BECOME IMPORTANT TO YOU? RO: WHEN I WAS YOUNG, IT SWEPT ME AWAY AND IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT SOMETHING BIGGER THAN WHERE I WAS. GQ: WHAT WOULD YOU TELL A MAN IS THE KEY TO FINDING OR DISCOVERING HIS PERSONAL STYLE? RO: I HAVE NO IDEA. MAYBE IT&#39;S NOT THAT IMPORTANT. MAYBE PERSONAL STYLE REALLY ISN&#39;T THAT IMPORTANT.

AFTER SHOWING HIS COLLECTION IN NEW YORK THE FOLLOWING YEARS, HE RELOCATED TO PARIS IN 2003, WHERE HE STILL LIVES AND ANNUALLY PRESENTS NEW WORK. BUILDING UP A WORLD-RENOWNED BRAND WHILE RETAINING HIS INDEPENDENCE AS A DESIGNER HAS EARNED HIM A UNIQUE POSITION IN A MARKET OTHERWISE DOMINATED BY MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES. WE SPOKE TO HIM AS HE ARRIVED IN DUBAI TO EXHIBIT SOME OF HIS FURNITURE SHORTLY AFTER THE PRESENTATION OF HIS MOST RECENT COLLECTION AT THIS SPRING&#39;S PARIS FASHION WEEK. HE HAS ALSO GENEROUSLY OFFERED THE TRAVEL ALMANAC A PEEK INTO HIS PRIVATE PHOTO ARCHIVE TO DIVULGE HIS IMPRESSIONS OF ROME. &nbsp; HELLO RICK, WHERE ARE YOU AT THE MOMENT AND HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT AFTER YOUR SHOW DURING THIS SPRING&#39;S PARIS FASHION WEEK? &nbsp; I&#39;M IN DUBAI FOR AN EXHIBITION OF MY FURNITURE. I FEEL LIGHT AS A FEATHER &ndash; THE GAP BETWEEN MY WOMEN&#39;S FALL SHOW AND MY MEN&#39;S SPRING SHOW IS THE LONGEST OF THE YEAR. I&#39;LL PROBABLY START GETTING ANTSY, HAVING GOTTEN ADDICTED TO THE PACE. &nbsp; WHERE ARE YOU SHOWING YOUR FURNITURE IN DUBAI? &nbsp; I&#39;M HERE FOR DESIGN DAYS DUBAI AND THE DUBAI ART FAIR &ndash; I&#39;M EXHIBITING NINE PIECES INDEPENDENTLY IN AN INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE. EVERYTHING&#39;S HELD UP IN CUSTOMS FOR A FEW DAYS SO I&#39;VE JUST BEEN AT THE BEACH FOR TWO DAYS, WHICH WAS PART OF THE IDEA. THERE&#39;S A PERVERSE LAND-OF-OZ ENERGY ABOUT DUBAI THAT APPEALS TO ME. EVOLUTION SEEMS TO HAVE FAST-FORWARDED HERE AND THERE&#39;S SOMETHING ATTRACTIVELY UNSETTLING ABOUT THAT. &nbsp; WHERE ARE YOU STAYING IN DUBAI? &nbsp; I&#39;M STAYING AT A BEACH RESORT WITH A VERY MANICURED PATH FROM MY BUNGALOW TERRACE TO THE VERY MANICURED BEACH. WHEN YOU&#39;RE SWIMMING IN THE VERY CLEAR WATER THERE&#39;S A UTOPIAN SKYLINE IN THE BACKGROUND WITH THE THUMPING OF TECHNO FAINTLY DRIFTING IN FROM CIRCLING YACHTS. AND AS I WRITE THIS I&#39;M FEEDING A COOKIE TO A PEACOCK. THERE&#39;S AN EERIE UNNATURALNESS HERE THAT I&#39;M LOVING... &nbsp; WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT PRESENTING YOUR WORK ON THE CATWALK THESE DAYS? I KNOW THAT YOU HAVEN&#39;T BEEN THE BIGGEST FAN OF THEM IN THE PAST. &nbsp; FOR BETTER OR WORSE, I&#39;VE ESTABLISHED AN IDENTITY THAT I&#39;M COMFORTABLE WITH. AND AFTER MAKING SOME MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY I&#39;VE COME TO FULLY ENJOY DOING SHOWS. IT&#39;S A WONDERFUL MOMENT OF COMMITMENT AND RESOLUTION. RUNAWAY SHOWS ARE CEREMONIES OF BEAUTY THAT CAN GIVE US A SATISFYING SHOT OF COMMUNAL WONDER. &nbsp; LIVING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WHOLE FASHION HUSTLE OF PARIS, HOW CAN YOU FIND PEACE AND TIME TO RELAX AFTER SUCH A SHOW? &nbsp; I LIVE IN MY OWN LITTLE CONCRETE BUBBLE THERE. &nbsp; BUT CAN THIS CONCRETE BUBBLE SHIELD YOU FROM IT ALL, OR DOES IT SOMETIMES GET TO BE A BIT MUCH THAT LIVING AND WORKING ARE SO CLOSELY CONNECTED FOR YOU? &nbsp; LIVING AND WORKING BEING CONNECTED IS KIND OF MY THING. I DON&#39;T MEAN TO DISMISS OUTSIDE INFLUENCES, AS I&#39;M SURE THEY&#39;RE IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ABSORB, BUT I FIND A SLIGHTLY UNHEALTHY, INTROSPECTIVE INSULATION SEEMS TO WORK BEST FOR ME. &nbsp; CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT THE PICTURES THAT WE SEE ACCOMPANYING THIS INTERVIEW &ndash; YOUR TRIP TO ROME AND THE CONNECTION YOU HAVE TO THESE PLACES? &nbsp; THESE PICTURES USUALLY HAVE THE SILHOUETTE OF MY BETTER HALF WANDERING THROUGH THEM. THEY&#39;RE MY VERSION OF POSTCARDS FROM THE GRAND TOUR WITH HER AS THE COMMON THEME. I KIND OF DELIGHT IN THE WAY SHE GLIDES THROUGH ANY LOCATION, BECOMING A TINY MONUMENT AMONG THE MONUMENTS. &nbsp; AND WHAT DID DRAW YOU TO ROME IN PARTICULAR? &nbsp; I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A LOCATION TO OPEN A STORE IN ITALY AND FELT ROME MIGHT BE LESS SATURATED WITH DESIGNER SHOPS THAN MILAN. AND THERE&#39;S THAT LAYER OF ANCIENT RAWNESS THAT APPEALS TO ME. IT WOULD BE GREAT HAVING AN EXCUSE TO SPEND MORE TIME THERE, BUT I DIDN&#39;T FIND THE RIGHT SPOT YET. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT I COULDN&#39;T GET INTO MUSSOLINI&#39;S FENCING GYM TO TAKE PICTURES BUT THE EUR COMPLEX WAS EPICALLY DESERTED AND MADE UP FOR IT. &nbsp; WHAT ROLE HAS PHOTOGRAPHY PLAYED AS YOU&#39;VE MOVED THROUGH VARIOUS PERIODS IN YOU LIFE? &nbsp; I&#39;M STRICTLY AN AMATEUR. I&#39;M HOPELESS TECHNICALLY, AND ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT WELL IS PURELY COINCIDENCE, I ASSURE YOU. I ALWAYS CONSOLE MYSELF THAT SOME OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS I&#39;VE ADMIRED FROM THE PAST RELIED ON JUST DAYLIGHT AND NO ASSISTANTS. &nbsp; WHAT DO YOU FIND MOST APPEALING ABOUT LOS ANGELES NOW THAT IT ISN&#39;T YOUR HOME? &nbsp; THE CONSISTENT CLIMATE. THE NOVELTY OF WAKING UP IN EUROPEAN WINTER DARKNESS HAS WORN OFF A BIT. &nbsp; HAVE YOU DISCOVERED ANY METHODS TO COPE WITH THE SEVERITY OF EUROPEAN WINTERS? &nbsp; THROW YOURSELF INTO IT. THIS WINTER I WENT TO ST. MORITZ TO IMPROVE MY SNOWBOARDING. &nbsp; WAS THERE A PLACE THAT YOU IDEALIZED AS A CHILD AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA? &nbsp; MY PARENTS HAD A LIBRARY WITH A LOT OF FIN-DE-SI&Egrave;CLE FRENCH LITERATURE &ndash; MALLARM&Eacute;, PROUST, HUYSMANS. THESE AUTHORS LIVED IN A WORLD AS EXOTIC TO ME AS THE MOON. I NEVER HAD THE IMAGINATION TO CONSIDER VISITING, MUCH LESS LIVING THERE.&nbsp; &nbsp; HOW DID YOU SPEND YOUR SUMMER AS A CHILD? &nbsp; WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

THEIR HOME IS NOTHING LIKE THE COOKIE-CUTTER HAUSSMANN FACSIMILES EITHER SIDE. IT IS FILLED WITH CONTEMPORARY ART, BRUTALIST FURNITURE AND SENSUAL MURALS BY MICHÈLE‘S DAUGHTER SCARLETT. WHAT IS APPARENT IN THE SPACE IS THE BEAUTY OF CONTRAST — CONCRETE, MINK, EBONY, STEEL — AND (AS WITH THE TWO OF THEM) THE INESCAPABLE MAGNETISM OF OPPOSITES. TODAY, THEIR LIVES ARE A TAPESTRY OF FAMILY, FRIENDS, ARTISTS, MUSICIANS AND WAYWARD SOULS, ALL OF WHOSE PATHS ARE INTERTWINED BY SO MUCH MORE THAN FASHION. THEY ARE A TRIBE OF CREATIVE MINDS SPREAD FROM LA TO DUBAI. IT WAS AT A RECENT LONDON SHOWING OF THE DUO’S MONUMENTAL FURNITURE RANGE (WHICH IS CRAFTED FROM OX BONE AND PETRIFIED WOOD) THAT I FIRST APPROACHED MICHÈLE ABOUT THIS ARTICLE. FROM BENEATH HER VEILED STEPHEN JONES TOP HAT, SHE IMMEDIATELY EXCLAIMED, “YES! WE BOTH HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE WE HAVE REALLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.” WEEKS LATER, OVER SUNDAY BRUNCH, I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER POINT. DAN THAWLEY. RICK, WHO IS THE FIRST PERSON THAT YOU MADE A PIECE OF CLOTHING FOR? RICK OWENS. I THINK IT WAS ABOUT ME, WHEN I STARTED. I DOUBT THAT IT WAS ABOUT ANYONE ELSE OR SOMEBODY ELSE. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT EXPRESSING ‘ME’. PROBABLY... YOU SHOULD KNOW I’M VERY SELFISH! I’M THE FIRST TO ADMIT IT. DT. HOW DID YOU DRESS BEFORE YOU MADE YOUR OWN CLOTHES? . RO. IN ARMY SURPLUS CLOTHES, WHICH I DYED IN BLACK. THERE WERE ALL THESE NEW WAVE THINGS GOING ON IN LOS ANGELES FASHION. YOUNG FASHION WAS VERY BIG AND THRIFT STORES WERE VERY BIG SO IT WAS VERY EASY TO FIND BLACK STUFF EVERYWHERE. DT. AND HOW DID YOU BOTH END UP IN LA? . RO. I MOVED FROM PORTERVILLE, WHICH IS A SMALL AGRICULTURAL TOWN ABOUT TWO HOURS AWAY FROM LA. MICHÈLE LAMY. I CAME TO LA FROM NEW YORK IN ’79, NEVER HAVING BEEN THERE. I JUST KNEW I WANTED TO MOVE THERE. I WAS DOING ADVERTISING AND EDITORIAL FOR DIFFERENT MAGAZINES, CALLED SLASH, STUFF AND WET. DT. DO YOU STILL HAVE THEM? . RO. NO, I DON’T HAVE ANY OF THEM. THERE WERE KIND OF PUNK ROCK FREE ZINES, BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT FANCIER BECAUSE THEY DID ADVERTISING FOR SOME OF THE FANCY PLACES IN TOWN, SO THEY WERE VERY COOL. THEY WERE LIKE INTERVIEW MAGAZINE BUT AT THE BEGINNING. ML. I WAS PART OF THIS THING, AND SO BEFORE WE KNEW EACH OTHER, HE KNEW ABOUT ME. RO. WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WOULD GO TO VISALIA, WHICH WAS A COOL TOWN CLOSE TO OUR TOWN, AND I’D BUY WET MAGAZINE AND I SAW ARTICLES AND PICTURES OF MICHÈLE. ML. I WAS EVEN WRITING A LITTLE BIT FOR STUFF ! RO. WE DIDN’T GET STUFF. WE WEREN’T COOL ENOUGH FOR STUFF — IT WAS TOO OBSCURE. FOR US, IT WAS JUST WET! ML. WE BECAME BEST FRIENDS AT THAT TIME, AND IT’S FUNNY NOW TO THINK THAT WE KNEW OF EACH OTHER BEFORE WE KNEW EACH OTHER, AND THAT IT WAS THE FAMOUS RICK CASTRO WHO MADE THE CLICK HAPPEN. AND THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE VAGINAL DAVIS AND THE KIPPER KIDS... I WAS MARRIED TO RICHARD NEWTON AT THE TIME. DT. SO HOW DID YOU COME TO WORK TOGETHER? . ML. WELL HE CAME INTO THE PICTURE BECAUSE I WAS WORKING WITH RICK CASTRO, WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM. I WANTED TO DO MEN’S CLOTHES AND RICK CASTRO SAID I COULDN’T MAKE IT WITHOUT THIS GUY, SO RICK [OWENS] BECAME MY PATTERN MAKER. THOSE TWO CAME UP WITH A FANTASTIC COLLECTION AND THAT’S WHEN I SAW HOW TALENTED RICK WAS. AND THEN HE WANTED TO DO HIS OWN THING. IT TOOK US YEARS TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS DIFFICULT AT THAT TIME. I THINK WHAT I BOUGHT INTO THE DESIGN STORY IN GENERAL, AS RICK IS SO TECHNICAL AND ANAL, WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE GYPSY-NESS. JUST LIKE RIPPING OFF A FEW DARTS OR THE HEM. RO. I DON’T KNOW. I THINK YOU LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU BROUGHT SOME KIND OF DECONSTRUCTION. BUT I THINK YOU’RE MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT, BECAUSE YOU WERE RAISED WITH SUCH AN EDUCATION THAT YOU HAVE THIS SENSE OF CHIC; YOU HAVE THIS REFINEMENT. YOU’RE ATTRACTED TO CHAOS BUT YOU LOVE THE DISCIPLINE OF ELEGANCE. WE ARE COMING FROM OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. UNDERNEATH IT ALL, YOU KNOW WHAT HAS REAL VALUE AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELEGANCE IS, AND YOU LIKE FIGHTING WITH THAT. WHERE I CAME FROM WAS A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER SO I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE GLAMOROUS AND EXOTIC. WHEREAS MICHÈLE WAS ALWAYS GLAMOROUS AND EXOTIC LOOKING MAYBE FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE CHEAPER! DT. AND YOU MET SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE? . ML. IT’S IN THE MIND AND IN THE VIBES. I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THAT WE COULD TALK FOREVER. WE WOULD TALK SO MUCH ABOUT CHRISTIAN BÉRARD WHEN I DIDN’T KNOW ANYONE ELSE WHO KNEW ABOUT HIM. AND WE HAVE THE SAME AESTHETIC. WHEN HE LIKES SOMETHING I SORT OF KNOW WHAT IT’S GOING TO LOOK LIKE. RO. YES. OUR AESTHETIC HAS BEEN A REALLY DEFINING PART. ML. I THINK THAT IS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE STAY TOGETHER, BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL OPINIONS OR MORAL OPINIONS. RO. BUT IF YOU CAN’T LIVE WITH THE SAME VASE IN THE HOUSE, THEN IT’S OVER. IF YOU’VE SEEN THE BATTLES OVER VASES IN THIS HOUSE! [LAUGHS] DT. RICK, WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE AND TOUCH FASHION BEFORE YOU CAME TO LA? . RO. OH, GOD NO! NOT EVEN IN LA. I MEAN I NEVER REALLY LOOKED AT FASHION THAT MUCH BEFORE. I JUST READ MAGAZINES. I DIDN’T REALLY HAVE THE NERVE TO GO TO BEVERLY HILLS AND TRY CLOTHES AT NEIMAN MARCUS — THAT WASN’T MY LIFE. SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE, IN A WAY, I WAS PRETTY INEXPERIENCED WHEN IT CAME TO FASHION. SO WHEN I WENT TO A SCHOOL WHERE THEY TAUGHT YOU HOW TO DO PATTERN MAKING, IT WAS ALL VERY MUCH FROM SCRATCH, WHICH WAS PROBABLY ALL FOR THE BEST. DT. WERE YOU WORKING FOR MICHÈLE WHEN THEY MADE THE LAMY MEN VIDEO IN 1987 WITH TONY WARD IN THE BATHHOUSE? . RO. YES, I WAS! THAT WAS WITH RICK CASTRO. I WAS THE PATTERNMAKER FOR ALL THOSE CLOTHES. AND THEY WERE ALL OUR FRIENDS. DT. IT FEELS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD CAPSULE OF THAT TIME... . RO. IT IS; IT IS. WE WERE LISTENING TO LAIBACH, AND ALL OF THOSE BOYS WERE PEOPLE WE HUNG OUT WITH. AND IT WAS SHOT BY MICHÈLE’S HUSBAND, RIGHT BEFORE SHE AND I GOT TOGETHER. DT. SO, LET’S FAST-FORWARD TO YOUR SPRING ’14 WOMENSWEAR SHOW VICIOUS, WHERE AMERICAN SORORITY ‘STEPPERS’ WORE THE COLLECTION INSTEAD OF MODELS... . RO. I DIDN’T EXPECT THIS MUCH REACTION. I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT REALLY STRUCK A NERVE. IT WAS AN EXERCISE; I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO REALLY LOOK AT THE BODY THAT WE SELL TO. IT WAS LITERALLY THAT TECHNICAL. LIKE, “I NEED TO WORK WITH BOOBS. I DON’T REALLY CONSIDER BOOBS ENOUGH SO LET’S THINK ABOUT BOOBS.” SO IT WAS REALLY AN EXERCISE OF THAT. HOW DO I DRESS THAT KIND OF FIGURE IN A NON-CONDESCENDING WAY? DT. HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THE RESULT? . RO. I LOVED IT. I WAS TICKLED TO DEATH! BUT THE FUNNIEST THING WAS THAT BEFORE I’D ONLY SEEN THESE GIRLS IN THEIR EXERCISE TIGHTS, WITH LIKE NO MAKE-UP, AND THEN I SAW THEM IN MY CLOTHES FOR THE SHOW. THEN WE HAD A PARTY WITH ALL OF THEM ON A BOAT AFTER THE SHOW AND THEN I WALKED IN AND I DIDN’T RECOGNIZE ANY OF THOSE GIRLS! THEY HAD PUT ALL THEIR MAKE-UP ON, TIGHT LITTLE DRESSES, HEELS AND STUFF, AND THEY WERE ADORABLE BUT I FELT A BIT DEFLATED. I WAS LIKE, “WOW — THIS IS HOW THEY REALLY WANNA LOOK.” THAT WAS AFFECTIVE. THEY LOOKED ADORABLE, HOT, SEXY! THEY KNEW HOW TO MAKE IT WORK WITH THEM, TO MAKE THEMSELVES ALL LUSCIOUS AND JUICY! I WAS THINKING, “I THOUGHT I DID A GOOD JOB BUT NOT SO MUCH...” DT. AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO SHOW IT AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME? . RO. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I ANALYZED A POLITICAL MOMENT, YOU KNOW LIKE REFERENCING WHAT WAS HAPPENING. BUT IT WAS REALLY JUST AN EMOTIONAL FEELING. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I WONDER, “AM I SMARTER THAN I THINK?” I DON’T THINK SO, BUT I COULD BE! DT. WHERE HAD YOU SEEN THE STEPPING GIRLS BEFORE? . ML. IN NEW YORK CITY, BUT EVEN BEFORE, FROM THE TIME WHEN JEAN-PAUL GOUDE CREATED THE SHOW FOR THE BICENTENARY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AT THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE IN 1989. RO. DID YOU SEE THAT? IT WAS REALLY SPECTACULAR. ML. HE DID SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY ABOUT CONTRAST. THERE WERE ALL THESE FABULOUS GIRLS LIKE FARIDA KHELFA. THIS WAS FOR ME THE BEST PARTY THAT EVER HAPPENED. RO. HE HAD JESSYE NORMAN DRESSED BY AZZEDINE ALAÏA ON A PLATFORM AROUND THE OBELISK OF THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE SINGING ‘LA MARSEILLAISE’! ML. PRESIDENT BUSH SR. WAS THE PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME, AND WHEN HE SAW WHO’D BEEN CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIS FACE. RO. WAS IT LIKE A NEW ORLEANS MARCHING BAND? ML. IT WAS THESE STEPPER GIRLS BUT THEY HAD THE BAND IN FRONT. FOR AN ARMY PARADE THAT WAS QUITE GOOD! DT. HOW OLD IS STEPPING CULTURE ACTUALLY? . RO. IT HAS ITS ROOTS IN SLAVERY. THAT’S WHY IT’S SO AMERICAN AND WHY IT HAS THAT KIND OF GRAVITY AND THAT KIND OF EMOTIONAL RESONANCE. FOR INSTANCE, THE FINAL SEQUENCE WHEN THEY LINK ARMS AND THEY MARCH OUT, THIS COMES FROM RACIAL INTEGRATION IN THE COLLEGES IN THE STATES. THEY WOULD HAVE RIOTING OUTSIDE THE COLLEGES AND THAT IS HOW THE BLACK STUDENTS WOULD GET THROUGH THE CROWDS TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL. EVEN IF I DIDN’T TELL YOU THAT STORY, YOU CAN FEEL THAT KIND OF EMOTION AND EVERYBODY CAN RESPOND TO FEELINGS OF OSTRACISM. TODAY, I THINK THEY KIND OF REPRESENT GRACE UNDER PRESSURE; THEY’VE TAKEN ADVERSITY AND THEY’VE CREATED THIS KIND OF JOYOUS REACTION TO IT. IT PROTECTS THEM. DT. IT REMINDED ME OF THE NEW ZEALAND MAORI CULTURE, THE HAKA DANCE. THAT WAS MY FIRST REACTION. DO MEN EVER DO IT? . RO. I DON’T THINK THEY DO. IT’S NOT AS PREVALENT. THEY PLAY FOOTBALL! ML. THOSE STEPPER GIRLS WERE THE LAST ONES TO FIGHT TO GET INTO COLLEGE BECAUSE EVEN THE BLACK COLLEGES WERE PREJUDICIAL TO WOMEN, SO THEY HAD TO FIGHT MORE THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. DT. I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES THAT YOU’RE ATTRACTED TO OR THAT ARE ATTRACTED BY WHAT YOU DO. WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY A PART OF YOUR STORY? . RO. WELL, THAT’S MICHÈLE. IF I HAD NEVER MET MICHÈLE, THIS HOUSE WOULD BE EMPTY, BECAUSE I WOULDN’T LET ANYBODY IN. MICHÈLE IS THE ONE THAT OPENS THE DOOR SO SHE IS THE ONE WHO FILTERS. SO HOW DO YOU CHOOSE HONEY? FIRST SHE SCANS THE GYM AND SEES WHO IS CUTE IN THE GYM! ML. OH! PLEASE NO! [LAUGHS] FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THIS GUY IS A CREATURE OF HABIT — HE HIRES PEOPLE AND THEY STAY THERE FOREVER. IN A WAY HE’S DOING THE SAME THINGS EXCEPT THAT PHYSICALLY, HE WANTS THEM OUT OF THE DOOR, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE ANSWERING IF HE WANTS THEM TO BE THERE. SO HE HAS A TEAM. EVEN WHEN HE THINKS IT’S NOT A TEAM, HE HAS A TEAM. RO. DID I TELL YOU THAT I’M VERY SPOILT AND SELFISH? [LAUGHS] ML. OF COURSE ON THE OTHER HAND I LIKE TEAMS. I LIKE PEOPLE. I SEE PEOPLE IN THE WAY THAT I WANT TO DO THINGS WITH THEM OR I KNOW THAT I CAN PUSH THEM. IT’S INSTINCT, YOU KNOW, AND I ALWAYS LIKE TO BE SEDUCED. I ALSO THINK THAT BECAUSE I AM HIS WIFE, THAT IT IS GOOD FOR HIS HEAD THAT I AM JUDGING. DT. WHAT ABOUT THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN MASCULINE AND FEMININE ENERGY, WHICH IS A PART OF WHAT YOU CREATE AND MANIFEST AROUND YOU? . RO. IT’S JUST A NATURAL EXPRESSION. I DON’T MAKE AN EFFORT TO CHALLENGE ANYTHING, AT LEAST NOT ANTAGONISTICALLY. IT’S AN EFFORT TO JUST KEEP THINGS AS PURE AS POSSIBLE.

RICKOWENS: THE 70S, THE 70S WERE SO GREAT WITH PLATFORMS AND ALL THAT EXAGGERATION, SUB EXAGGERATION, AND YOU KNOW I’M NOT A FASHION HISTORIAN, I’M SURE THAT THERE IS A FORMULA OF WHAT THAT WAS A RESPONSE TO. THAT KIND OF FLAMBOYANCE THERE IS A LOT OF, I GUESS, A LOT OF SEXUAL REVOLUTIONS THEN, BUT THAT EXTREME FLAMBOYANCE WAS ALMOST GROTESQUE AND IT WAS ALMOST ‘KABUKI’, IT WAS SO EXAGGERATED, I’M ALWAYS KIND OF IMPRESSED BY THAT PERIOD AND HOW THEY ALMOST EMBRACED THE GROTESQUE, AND WHEN YOU THINK OF BUSTLES AND PANNIERS, I’M SURE THERE IS A DIRECT POLITICAL LINK, I JUST HAVEN’T STUDIED IT THAT MUCH TO FIGURE IT OUT. FILEP: IN ANCIENT HISTORY MONSTERS WERE CREATED DUE TO LACK OF LOGICAL EXPLANATION, FEAR OF THINGS THAT THEY DIDN’T UNDERSTAND, WHAT ABOUT TODAY? RICK: YOU KNOW, PEOPLE REFERRED TO AS A GOTHIC DESIGNER A LOT, WHICH IS FINE, IT DOESN’T BOTHER ME, BUT I DON’T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE EVER BEEN AN AUTHENTIC GOTH, BUT I THINK I PROBABLY PRETTY MUCH WAS. I WAS AS ‘GOTH’ AS I COULD GET WHEN I WAS YOUNG, BUT I THINK ALL OF THOSE KIDS, I WOULD ASSUME, ARE FULLY AWARE OF CREATING THIS KIND OF SEVERE IMAGE TO MASK INSECURITIES. I ALWAYS KIND OF ASSUMED THAT EVERYONE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A CAMP ELEMENT TOO, AND THAT KIND OF IRONY, IT COULDN’T HAVE COMPLETELY ESCAPED EVERYBODY DURING THAT TIME. I THINK THE WHOLE BLACK LEATHER SINISTER, OMINOUS LOOKING CLOTHES, I MEAN IT’S OUR CURRENT DEFENCE AGAINST FEAR AND VULNERABILITY AND INSECURITY, DOES THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION? FILEP: HUMANS CREATED SOMEHOW MODERNISM IN THEIR RESEARCH OF FINDING NEW PATHS, NEW ANSWERS FOR THINGS, AND… RICK: DO YOU THINK SO? I ALWAYS WONDER IF ITS CYCLES, IF IT’S OVER EXUBERANCE AND OVER-EMBELLISHMENT AND THEN AS A REACTION TO THAT THE OBVIOUS REACTION IS REDUCTION AND REDUCING TO ESSENCES AND CALMING DOWN. I THINK IT IS ALWAYS JUST KIND OF A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN OVER STIMULATION AND CALMING DOWN. SOMETIMES I THINK IT IS THAT SIMPLE. IT SOUND SUPER SIMPLISTIC, BUT I THINK A LOT OF TIMES LIFE IS SUPER SIMPLE BUT THEN THAT MIGHT JUST BE ME BEING SUPER SIMPLE. FILEP: RICK, ARE MONSTERS RETRO TODAY? RICK: ARE THEY RETRO? FILEP: ARE THEY STILL AROUND SOMEHOW? RICK: WELL YOU KNOW WE JUST HAD, I DON’T KNOW IF THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO BRING THIS UP, BUT WE JUST HAD THIS AMAZING SHOOTING A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND IT’S SHOCKING TO THINK THAT THAT KIND OF THING… BUT IT’S KIND OF NOT… THERE’S A SIDE OF ME THAT’S SHOCKED AND THERE’S A SIDE OF ME, I MEAN, THAT’S A DARKNESS THAT MOST OF US WILL NEVER KNOW, THANK GOD, BUT THERE IS ALSO A SIDE, PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND EVERYTHING AND THERE IS A SIDE OF ME THINKING, YOU KNOW, WE ARE A CULTURE THAT RELISHES VIOLENCE, WE’RE MORE LIKE A SPECIES THAT RELISHES VIOLENCE, WE ALWAYS ENJOYED A LOT OF VIOLENCE AND FRANKLY I’M SURPRISED THIS KIND OF THING DOESN’T HAPPEN MORE OFTEN: ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED WAR AND A CONTINENT THAT NEVER EXPERIENCED A MAJOR WAR, THE LAST WAS A CIVIL WAR, A MAJOR WAR ON ITS.., THEY DON’T HAVE THE HISTORY, THEY DON’T HAVE…, I MEAN THIS IS ALL THEORY AND THIS IS MY COMPLETELY AMATEUR THEORY, I MEAN I HATE PEOPLE WHO MAKE PROCLAMATIONS BUT AMERICANS JUST DON’T HAVE THAT KIND OF DARKNESS AND FEAR AND HORROR IN THEIR BLOOD, THE WAY EUROPEANS DO, EUROPEANS THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF WARS AND I SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A HUMAN HUNGER FOR VIOLENCE AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT JUST LEAKS OUT. …SO THEY ARE DEFIANTLY MONSTERS… FILEP: STAYING ON THIS SPECIFIC INCIDENT YOU REFER TO, AS YOU SAID IN EUROPE WE HAVE HAD WARS AND NOTHING AS SUCH HAS HAPPENED IN THE STATES, DO YOU THINK THE STATES NEEDS A WAR TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO CALM THINGS DOWN FOR THEM? RICK: NO, NO I DON’T. I THINK THEY’VE INVESTED IN SPORTS AND VIOLENT MOVIES, THEY’VE GOT A CUPBOARD, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT’S SOMETHING HORRIBLE LIKE THIS, ITS JUST KIND OF INEVITABLE WHEN YOU BRING IN THAT MANY PEOPLE TOGETHER ALL AT ONCE AND, LIKE I SAID, SOMETIMES I’M JUST A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED THAT THIS DOESN’T ALMOST HAPPEN MORE OFTEN, BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ BLOGS, WHEN YOU READ PEOPLE’S REACTIONS TO THINGS… I WAS JUST READING KATHY HORN’S ARTICLE ABOUT BARNEYS YESTERDAY, DID YOU READ IT? IT WAS FUNNY…, DID YOU READ ALL THE LETTERS AFTERWARDS, ALL OF THE RESPONSES? FILEP: WELL NOT ALL OF IT BUT I READ 5 OR 6 OF THEM… RICK: THERE WERE 109 RESPONSES TO THAT ARTICLE AND I READ THEM ALL. AFTERWARDS I WAS A LITTLE DEPRESSED, THERE IS JUST THIS HOSTILITY, AND IT WASN’T JUST IN RESPONSE TO THIS ARTICLE, I SEE THAT ON THE INTERNET A LOT BECAUSE I’M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS, IT FASCINATES ME HOW, GIVING A HIDING PLACE AND A PLACE TO KIND OF TO HAVE A PUBLIC FORM HELPS PEOPLE INEVITABLY GET NAKED AND HOSTILE AND SUPERIOR AND ANGRY AND IT’S DISTURBING, IT’S SO DISTURBING AND I REALISE THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE TIME AND INCLINATION TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET OR ON A BLOG MIGHT NOT HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT, AND I THINK THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY A LITTLE SUSPECT, AND THAT IS A VERY UNKIND THING TO SAY AND I MIGHT BE TOTALLY WRONG, BUT IT’S DISTURBING THAT THAT’S PREDOMINANT, IF YOU GO THROUGH 109 EMAILS, IT’S PREDOMINANTLY HOSTILE AND, THAT KIND OF FREAKS ME OUT. FILEP: BACK TO MONSTERS… CAN A MONSTER ALSO BE BEAUTIFUL? RICK: WELL, THAT’S ALWAYS KIND OF BEEN MY THING, BEAUTIFUL MONSTERS, AND PART OF IT IS A LOT ABOUT SELF ACCEPTANCE BECAUSE MONSTERS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE ALL BURY WITHIN, ALL OF US FEEL LIKE MONSTERS, ALL OF US FEEL WE HAVE SO MANY FLAWS, SORE SPOTS, BAD SPOTS, LIKE WE ARE SUPPRESSING. I WAS THINKING OF THIS ON THE METRO THIS MORNING, I WAS THINKING, HALF OF MY DAY IS KIND OF PUNISHING MYSELF FOR HAVING DONE OR SAID THE WRONG THINGS, OR CRITICISING THE WORLD AROUND ME FOR NOT BEING GOOD ENOUGH, FOR ME NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE THINGS EXACTLY THE WAY I WANT TO, AND I’M ALWAYS KIND OF THINKING THAT THEN I FEEL GUILTY FOR BEING SUCH A CUNT, FOR BEING SO CRITICAL, AND SO DEMANDING AND SO SELF CENTRED, ALL ABOUT MY EGO AND ALL ABOUT MY NEEDS. SO I WHIP MYSELF INTO THIS FRENZY OF SELF CRITICISM AND LONELY… BUT AS I’VE GOTTEN OLDER I’VE LEARNED THAT I DON’T HAVE TO PUNISH MYSELF OR FEEL SO GUILTY ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER AND NOBODY REALLY CARES AND IT’S NOT GOING TO REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN HUNDRED YEARS, SO, I’VE LEARNED TO FORGIVE MYSELF FOR BEING A CUNT, AND THAT’S A PART IN ALL OF US, WE ALL STRUGGLE TO KEEP THAT BALANCE I THINK, AND TRY AND NOT BEAT OURSELVES UP TOO MUCH, AND TRY AND DO BETTER AND IMPROVE AND IT’S A LITTLE ‘TITTER TOTTER’ EVERY SINGLE DAY, TODAY I’M GOING TO BE BETTER, OH SHIT, I F CKED UP, I’M NOT, …BUT OK, IT’LL WORK OUT BETTER TOMORROW, AND THAT’S THE BEAUTIFUL MONSTER IN ALL OF US. WE ALL HAVE FLAWS BUT THE BEAUTY IS THAT ALL OF US ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE AND BE BETTER. FILEP: NOW WE MOVE ON TO FETISH. WHAT MAKES AN IDENTITY, A BRAND, SO STRONG THAT PEOPLE GET FRENZY ABOUT IT? RICK: WELL, IF I COULD EXPLAIN THAT, I WOULD PACKAGE IT AND SELL IT MYSELF! IT’S ABOUT ALLURE, IT’S ABOUT MYSTERY, I DON’T THINK IT CAN BE DONE JUST WITH A FORMULA AND A PLAN AND HARD WORK. THAT’S MAGIC, THAT’S THE MAGIC OF FASHION. YOU CAN JUST NEVER PREDICT HOW IT’S GOING TO BE OR HOW IT’S GOING TO END UP BEING OR WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHEN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN YOU GRAB ONTO IT, BECAUSE IT IS A MYSTERY. IT’S SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE… I DON’T KNOW HOW IT’S DONE, IF I KNEW I WOULD WRITE A BOOK. FILEP: DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN FIXATION WITH BRANDS AND THINGS? RICK: I USED TO, MORE THAN I DO NOW, OF COURSE ITS DEMYSTIFIED NOW, ONCE YOU ARE KIND OF BACKSTAGE. AFTER A LIFE IN FACTORIES PRODUCING CLOTHES, IT’S A LITTLE HARD TO BE IMPRESSED BY THE ‘MAGIC’ ANYMORE, BECAUSE IT’S NOT MAGIC – IT IS A LOT OF HARD WORK. WHEN I LOOK AT MY STUFF, IT’S REALLY RARE…, I’M KIND OF IN THE POSITION NOW THAT I ENVIED TWENTY YEARS AGO, THERE WERE DESIGNERS THAT I THOUGHT WERE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL AND I THINK I WOULD HAVE HAD APPRECIATED ‘ME’ TWENTY YEARS AGO. BUT BEING ME, I NOW KNOW HOW MUCH EFFORT, BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS, AND HOW KIND OF BORING MISTAKES, AND HOW MANY THINGS WE HAD TO GO THROUGH, TO THROW AWAY, IN ORDER TO GET TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW. SO SOMETIMES I TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE AND STEP BACK AND WALK INTO ONE OF MY STORES AND TRY TO ENJOY THE MAGIC BUT IT’S REALLY HARD, IT’S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE ALL I CAN SEE ARE FLAWS, ALL I CAN SEE ARE MISTAKES, ALL I CAN SEE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE BETTER NEXT TIME OR THINGS I WANT TO CHANGE. IT’S REALLY RARE TO GET THAT SATISFACTION. DOES ANYTHING OF THIS DEAL WITH YOUR QUESTION? FILEP: TOTALLY! I’VE SEEN DOCUMENTARIES, PEOPLE BUYING DOLLS AND FEED THEM, TREAT THEM AS HUMANS IN THEIR HOUSES… RICK: OH WELL, THAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT I MEAN THAT’S NOT A COMMON THING AND PEOPLE HAVE WORSHIPPED POSSESSIONS SINCE FOREVER, ALL OF THOSE URNS IN KING TUT’S TOMB, SO PEOPLE ALWAYS INVESTED A LOT EMOTIONALLY, AND IN PETS… KNOWING PEOPLE INVEST ALL OF THEIR EMOTIONS INTO PETS, BUT YOU KNOW, ANY KIND OF LOVE IS POSITIVE – PRETTY MUCH, I THINK. FILEP: EVEN WITH AN OBJECT? RICK: I DON’T SEE WHY NOT. IT’S MORE POSITIVE THAN SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE SOMEBODY WHO WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO MATERIALISTIC … I MEAN IF I HAD A SON OR A DAUGHTER I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOOK TOWARDS SOMETHING THEY COULD RESPOND OR RECIPROCATE, BUT I TRY NOT TO JUDGE TOO MUCH. FILEP: AND FETISH AS ALWAYS BEEN LINKED TO SEXUALLY PROVOCATIVE CLOTHES, AT LEAST FASHION WISE, WHILE TODAY BEHAVIOURS LINKED TO SUCH MANNERS HAVE EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WE ARE NOW AROUSED BY LET’S SAY, THE SIGHT OF A LOGO OR A CERTAIN DESIGNER. RICK: YOU KNOW AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HAS A FETISH GALLERY IN LOS ANGELES AND THIS REMINDED ME OF THE WHOLE LEATHER SCENE IN THE 70S, AND KIDS DON’T HAVE THAT NOW, THE WHOLE ‘LEATHER THING’, AND I REMEMBER JUST THE WHOLE OF ALLURE AND MYSTIC OF LEATHER BARS, THERE WAS ONE IN LOS ANGELES CALLED THE SPIKE, WHERE WE ALWAYS WENT TO AND YOU KNOW, IT’S THREE IN THE MORNING AND THERE IS THIS LOUD MUSIC PLAYING AND THERE ARE ALL THIS MEN IN LEATHER UNIFORMS STANDING AROUND, STARRING STRAIGHT AHEAD AND NOT CONNECTING AT ALL, HOLDING BEERS IN THEIR HANDS AND IT’S EERIE, IT WAS COMPLETELY EERIE, THERE WAS THIS SUSPENDED MOMENT AND ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO LOOK OMINOUS, BUT THEY ALL WANTED TO BE SWEPT OF THEIR FEET BY SOMEBODY. AND THERE WAS THIS DESPERATION AND THIS KIND OF PHONEY…, AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT GUILT AND IT WAS ABOUT REPRESSION. THE KIDS NOW DON’T FEEL THAT, IT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE THEY NEED THAT KIND OF CEREMONY… FILEP: PROCEDURE…? RICK: …YEAH, PROCEDURE… FILEP: …BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF A PROCEDURE AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK FINDING THE EQUIPMENT TO EXPRESS OUTSIDE WHAT YOU HAVE INSIDE, SOMEHOW… RICK: WELL, IT’S PAGEANTRY AND IT’ SO ATTRACTIVE, IT’S LIKE A COVEN OF WITCHES, IT’S LIKE A CEREMONY AT THE VATICAN I MEAN WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THESE KINDS OF CONCEPT OF CEREMONIES, IT’S FUNNY HOW IN THE GAY WORLD THAT KIND OF DISAPPEARED, I THINK THEY DON’T DO THAT ANYMORE, I MEAN THEY DO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IT WAS THEN. THEY WILL ALWAYS HAVE THIS FIST-F CKING BARS OR SOMETHING, BUT IT WAS MORE PERVASIVE THEN…, ITS ALL WITH THE GAY MARRIAGE, NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ALL THIS GAY MARRIAGES, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS WONDERFUL, FILTHY LEATHER BARS ANYMORE. IT’S A SHAME. WE SHOULD START CAMPAIGNING TO PUT THE GAY WORLD BACK UNDERGROUND. FILEP: WHY DO YOU THINK GAY MARRIAGES WILL STOP SUCH THINGS? RICK: BECAUSE NOW IT’S NORMAL AND HEALTHY AND THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT AND IT WAS SHAME AND FEAR THAT CREATED LEATHER BARS. YOU HAD TO HAVE THIS FANTASY OF BEING THIS SINISTER FORCE TO FIGHT BACK. NOW THE GAY WORLD IS VERY WELL MARKED, VERY CLEAN AND SANITISED. WE NEED TO BRING BACK GAY SHAME. FILEP: SO, IS LUXURY THE NEW FETISH? RICK: WELL, I MEAN, THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN LUXURY. WHEN PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED… ENTITLEMENT, THERE IS A BIG CULTURE OF ENTITLEMENT AND I GUESS THAT HAPPENS WHEN A CULTURE IS SUCCESSFUL AND COMFORTABLE AND IN GOOD SHAPE, OVER ALL. IT’S FUNNY TALKING ABOUT HARDSHIP AND WAR. THE WORLD DOES GO IN CYCLES AND IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT THE NEXT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IS GOING TO BE, BECAUSE IT’S KIND OF INEVITABLE AND IT’S ALMOST THAT KIND OF WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP. I WONDER, IT’S SOMETHING I THINK ABOUT. FILEP: DID YOU SEE THAT DOCUMENTARY, IT JUST CAME OUT, ABOUT FASHION IN PARIS, IT’S A THREE-HOUR DOCUMENTARY. RICK: OH YES, I GOT IT. FILEP: OH MY GOD, WHAT A WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARY, RIGHT? SO PRECISE… RICK: YOU KNOW IT’S FUNNY, THERE IS THAT PART ABOUT ALEXANDER MCQUEEN DYING AND THEY SHOW THE KATE MOSS HOLOGRAM AND I’M TALKING OVER IT – I’M TALKING ABOUT ALEXANDER MCQUEEN ‘S DEATH, AND WHEN THEY WERE INTERVIEWING ME, AND I KNOW IT JUST HAPPENED I SAID “OH AND THIS IS OFF THE RECORD, DON’T RECORD THIS” BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT AND I WAS SAYING HOW I FELT AND I WAS KIND OF CRINGING THINKING OH SHIT THEY’VE GOT ME LIKE EULOGIZING ALEXANDER MCQUEEN AND MAKING SOME KIND OF STUPID PROCLAMATION… AND, AS IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT, WHAT I SAID ENDED UP SOUNDING RESPECTABLE AND RESPECTFUL… AND I DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING… BECAUSE I COULDN’T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, I JUST REALISED THAT IT WAS MY VOICE WHEN I HEARD IT AND THEN I REMEMBERED TALKING ABOUT IT, – NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO KNOW BECAUSE THEY DON’T SAY ‘VOICE OVER BY RICK OWENS’, UNLESS YOU RECOGNISE MY VOICE, YOU WOULDN’T KNOW, BUT I WAS THINKING OH MY GOD HOW POMPOUS FOR ME TO HAVE ANY OPINION ON ALEXANDER MCQUEEN’S DEATH, BUT WHAT I SAID WAS FAIRLY MUTUAL AND VERY RESPECTFUL, SO I WAS THINKING I DON’T SOUND LIKE A D CK, I RESPECTED THAT SITUATION VERY MUCH AND I WOULDN’T WANT TO TRIVIALISE IT OR THINK I HAD ANYTHING IMPORTANT TO SAY ABOUT IT. SO THAT WASN’T TOO BAD. THEN THEY GO TO THE JOHN GALLIANO THING, AND I’M TALKING OVER THAT, TOO! BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I’D BEEN VERY CHATTY THAT DAY AND I’M THINKING OH GOD, WHY WAS I SO CHATTY AND TALKING ABOUT THESE GUYS, THAT ENDED UP KIND OF BEING OK, TOO. FILEP: I DIDN’T REALISE, AND I KNOW YOUR VOICE. RICK: I DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING THAT WAS TOO RIDICULOUS. FILEP: BUT THAT WAS A HELL OF A DOCUMENTARY! RICK: AND I LOVED HOW THEY SHOWED MARGIELA PICTURES, AND I LOVED HOW THEY SHOWED THIERRY MUGLER BEFORE AND AFTER. FILEP: HOW IN YOUR OPINION HISTORICAL CITIES LIKE FLORENCE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW FLORENCE USED TO BE THE CENTRE OF FASHION BACK IN THE DAYS, EVERYTHING STARTED FROM THERE. SO HOW CAN A HISTORICAL CITY LIKE FLORENCE BECOME TODAY WHAT IT USED TO BE IN THE PAST: A PLACE FOR INNOVATIVE FORMS OF ART AND EXPRESSION? RICK: WELL, WHY SHOULD IT? FILEP: HAVING IN MIND THAT EVERYTHING STARTED THERE AND NOW PARIS IS LIKE THE KING OR QUEEN OF IT ALL. RICK: WELL YOU KNOW, MAYBE FLORENCE HAD ITS TURN AND THAT WAS LOVELY, AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO HAVE ITS TURN, MAYBE THE NEXT TURN IS GOING TO BE HAWAII! FILEP: DO YOU THINK IT’S GOING TO CHANGE? RICK: YES, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE, AND I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S GOING CHANGE IN OUR LIFETIME BUT IT’S DESTINED TO CHANGE, I MEAN FASHION IS ABOUT CHANGE AND IF IT DIDN’T IT WOULD JUST DROP DEAD, SO IT HAS TO. FILEP: RICK, WAS IS THE ROLE OF HISTORY AND ART HISTORY IN YOUR CONCEPT OF FASHION AND HOW CAN THEY SERVE THE FUTURE? ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO GOES BACK TO HISTORY IN GENERAL? RICK: NOT SPECIFICALLY, WHEN I MAKE CLOTHES I THINK OF THEM AS ARRANGEMENTS OR COMPOSITIONS OF THINGS THAT ALREADY EXIST. I DON’T USE A NEW MOOD BOARD OR ANYTHING BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAS EVER ATTRACTED ME IN MY LIFE, THAT IS JUST IN ME SOMEWHERE, SO IF IT’S A DIRECT REFERENCE OR A INDIRECT REFERENCE, IT’S BASED ON HISTORY OF THE WORLD, ON EVERYTHING THAT I’VE LEARNED OR I’VE RETAINED AND THERE ARE MOMENTS THAT CAPTURE A GENERATION. SO WHEN YOU SEE A PACO RABANNE HELMET, YOU’RE THINKING OF THE POLITICS THAT DAY, THE FEELINGS, OF WHAT WAS ON TV DURING THAT PERIOD, YOU HAVE SO MANY REFERENCES THAT ARE JUST CONTAINED IN THAT PACO RABANNE HELMET, AND IF YOU PUT THAT PACO RABANNE HELMET, SOMETHING THAT’S ALLUDES TO IT, YOUR COLLECTION WITH A DESTROYED LEATHER COAT, YOU ARE CREATING THAT COMPOSITION THAT HAS 60’S TV REFERENCES MIXED WITH SOMETHING…, I MEAN YOU ARE JUST CREATING THIS WORLD OF REFERENCES, AND IF YOU’RE LUCKY PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT AND RELATE TO THAT BECAUSE THEY’LL HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCES AND THEY’LL CATCH THAT COMPOSITION… FILEP: HOW DO MEAN IF YOU ARE LUCKY PEOPLE WILL RELATE TO THAT? LUCKY… YOU USED THE WORD LUCKY. RICK: IF YOU CREATE THE COMPOSITION IN AN ATTRACTIVE BALANCED WAY, THE SAME WAY YOU PREPARE A MEAL, LIKE IF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OREGANO IS GOING TO BALANCE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT, IT WORKS AND PEOPLE WILL RESPOND TO IT, PEOPLE FEEL IT AND IT’S KIND OF THE SAME THING WITH CLOTHES AND REFERENCES. IF YOU KIND OF CREATE THE RIGHT MIXTURE OF REFERENCES IT’S GOING TO BE GRACEFUL, LOGICAL AND POETIC, AND IT WILL REGISTER… FILEP: REGISTER… I LIKE THIS WORD RICK: YES, AND IT WILL CLICK TO ENOUGH PEOPLE THAT IT KIND OF CREATES A COMMUNAL MOMENT IN A WAY. FILEP: SO, SPEAKING OF COMMUNAL MOMENTS, IS CREATION A LANGUAGE FINALLY? A UTILITY? IS IT A LANGUAGE ONE NEEDS TO LEARN? RICK: I DON’T KNOW IF ONE NEEDS TO LEARN IT, I THINK YOU JUST NATURALLY LEARN IT. IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO OR TALKING ABOUT FASHION SPECIFICALLY, IT’S SUCH A CONVERSATION. EVERYTHING THAT YOU PUT ON IS TELLING OTHER PEOPLE SOMETHING IN SUBTLE WAYS OR NOT SO SUBTLE WAYS, YOU ARE COMMUNICATING TO PEOPLE AND YOU ARE COMMUNICATING YOUR DESIRE TO BE NOTICED, YOUR DESIRE TO NOT BE NOTICED, YOUR DESIRE TO CONNECT, OR YOUR DESIRE TO BE LEFT ALONE, YOUR DESIRE TO BE ADMIRED. YOU’RE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT YOU MIGHT BE PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT, YOU’RE KIND OF PRESENTING A CONSERVATIVE IMAGE, THAT KIND OF LEAD THE DISCUSSION IN ONE DIRECTION OR A LIBERAL MESSAGE THAT IS OPEN UP A DIALOGUE WITH PEOPLE, I MEAN IT’S THE FIRST STEP IN BEING THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE AND PRESENTING THAT PERSON TO OTHER PEOPLE, SO YES, IT’S SUCH A DIALOGUE.

IN THEIR FACE THERE IS ANGER, POWER AND SO MANY FEELINGS. WHY USE THEM AS MODELS IN YOUR SHOW? FASHION CAN BE RESTRICTIVE, RIGID AND SUPERIOR. I LIKED PROPOSING OTHER OPTIONS. THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO BE BEAUTIFUL, AND THE FASHION WORLD CAN SHOW ONLY A FRACTION OF THAT. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE BEAUTY OF UNITY, SPIRIT, CONFIDENCE AND PRIDE IN ONESELF. BUT ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TRAITS OF ALL IS HUMOR. THE SCOWLS WORN BY THE DANCERS WERE WHAT IS CALLED “GRITFACE” WHICH IS A TRADITIONAL ELEMENT IN SOME FACTIONS OF THE STEPPING COMMUNITY, MEANT TO SYMBOLIZE THE INTIMIDATION OF AN OPPONENT. I CANT TAKE CREDIT FOR INVENTING IT. IT&#39;S OBVIOUSLY A CHEERFUL EXAGGERATION THAT CAN BE FOUND IN OLD DANCES GLOBALLY LIKE THE MAORI TRIBES OR KABUKI. I THOUGHT THIS EXAGGERATED ARTIFICE WAS VERY WITTY IN ITS DISMISSAL OF STANDARD BEAUTY. WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SAY WITH THIS SHOW? STEP DANCE IS SPECIFICALLY AMERICAN. IT WAS A RESPONSE TO THE STRUGGLE FOR RACIAL INTEGRATION IN AMERICAN COLLEGES OF THE 1960S. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR ME TO PLAY WITH, BUT I THINK ALL OF US CAN RELATE TO FEELING OSTRACIZED AND UNWANTED AT SOME POINT ON A PRIMAL LEVEL. I THOUGHT STEP DANCING WAS A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF GRACE UNDER PRESSURE THAT COULD MEAN SOMETHING TO EVERYONE. NOT &quot;FASHION BODIES.&quot; WHY? IT WAS A PERSONAL EXERCISE TO CONSIDER CURVES AND SIZE RANGES IN THE CLOTHES I SELL. THIS WAS A GREAT WAY FOR US IN THE STUDIO TO STUDY MORE WAYS TO MAKE CLOTHES AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE. IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS THAT. WHAT DO PHAROAH HEADPIECES SYMBOLIZE FOR YOU? COMBINING HISTORICALLY ICONIC SHAPES PRESENTS THE BIGGEST PICTURE I CAN COME UP WITH. WHEN YOU MIX A PHAROAH&#39;S HAT, SKATEBOARDES SHORTS, A JULIET GRECO TURTLENECK AND A JOEY RAMONE SHOE IN A MONOTONE SILHOUETTE, YOU&#39;RE THINKING OF YOURSELF ON A LARGER STAGE THAN JUST THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT. AS YOU TOOK YOUR FINAL BOW FROM ABOVE SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU TOOK ON THE ROLE OF GOD, AND THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD WITNESSED THE RESURRECTION. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? I COULDN&#39;T RESIST THAT THEATRICAL MOMENT! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SILLY NOT TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE DRAMA! FASHION GENERALLY IDEALIZES THE BODY BUT YOU DID NOT. CAN YOU THINK OF A FASHION WORLD WITHOUT SKINNY, WHITE BODIES? I DONT MEAN TO TEACH ANYONE ANY LESSONS. THE FASHION WORLD IS RESPONDING TO GENERAL DESIRE, NOT REALLY DICTATING IT. I&#39;M JUST LUCKY THAT I HAVE A NICHE THAT DOESN&#39;T HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE. ANY SPECIAL WORDS FOR VOGUE TURKEY? SENI SEVIYORUM DILIYORUM!

SINCE HIS DEBUT, THIS VISIONARY DESIGNER WITH HIS HALO OF AN UNDERGROUND STAR, PUSHES FASHION WITH HIS REJECTION OF CONVENTIONS, HIS ROCK-INHERITED IDEALISM, HIS DARK CAMP STYLE, AND REINVENTED BLACK LEATHER. HIS LATEST MISSION: REPLACE MINI SKIRTS WITH SHORTS TO FINISH RELEASING WOMEN FROM ALL THEIR CHAINS. DO YOU WATCH WOMEN A LOT? YES. I WATCH EVERYBODY A LOT. WHAT WOMEN WOULD YOU LOVE TO HAVE DINNER WITH? EDITH SITWELL. SHE WAS A ENGLISH POET, AND I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER, EVEN THOUGH I AM NOT FOND OF POETRY MYSELF, BECAUSE IT’S OFTEN PRECIOUS AND ABSTRACT, AND I AM TOO IMPATIENT, PRAGMATIC. I LIKE TO GET RIGHT TO THE POINT. BUT SITWELL, WHO WASN’T PHYSICALLY APPEALING, BUILT HERSELF A CHARACTER, INVENTED HERSELF AS A MAJESTIC CREATURE BY DRESSING WITH MONACAL OR BYZANTINE-INSPIRED CLOTHES, AND LIKE THIS, SHE TURNED HERSELF INTO A MYTH. I LIKE WHEN PEOPLE HAVEN’T THE ADVANTAGE OF BEAUTY AND INVENT SOMETHING SINGULAR FROM SCRATCH. WHO WOULD YOU HATE TO SEAT NEXT TO? DINNER PARTIES ARE A NIGHTMARE TO ME, SO I DON’T ATTEND DINNER PARTIES. AS I WANT TO LOOK SMART, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO MAKE SUCH AN EFFORT TO BECOME BETTER THAN I AM, AND THAT’S EXHAUSTING. I GREW UP AS THE ONLY CHILD OF MY FAMILY IN A SMALL TOWN OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH HASN’T HELPED ME TO FEEL AT EASE IN SOCIETY - ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT MADE ME A CREATIVE PERSON. I AM SOLITARY, EVEN AT WORK, I HAVE A HARD TIME COLLABORATING. SO LET’S SAY I AM GOING TO A DINNER PARTY, I WOULD LIKE TO SIT NEXT TO A WOMEN WHO DOESN’T TAKE HERSELF SERIOUSLY, WHO LAUGHS EASILY, BECAUSE THAT KIND OF CHARACTER, WHO CAN LAUGH AT THEMSELVES, WOULDN’T JUDGE ME, AND I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE. A WOMAN WHO WOULD BE POLITE: WHEN SOMEONE HAS MANNERS, I SYSTEMATICALLY LIKE THEM, BECAUSE COURTESY IS USUALLY A SIGN OF KINDNESS. SO TO PRECISELY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE FOR ME TO SIT NEXT TO A WOMEN WHO WOULD BE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. WHAT CLOTHING SEEMS PROHIBITIVE TO YOU? WHICH CLOTHING DO YOU WANT TO REMOVE FROM A WOMAN’S WARDROBE? MINISKIRTS. THEY MADE SENSE IN THE 60’S, WHEN WOMEN GAINED CONTROL OF THEIR SEXUALITY WITH THE PILL AND WERE ABLE TO DECIDE TO MAKE LOVE WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO. BUT THEN IT BECAME COMMON, AND A WOMEN WHO WEAR MINISKIRTS TODAY ARE VULNERABLE. SHE HAS TO SIT A CERTAIN WAY, CROSS HER LEGS, AND THERE IS ALWAYS THIS MOVEMENT, WHEN SHE SITS, SHE PULLS HER SKIRT. I UNDERSTAND THAT WEARING A MINISKIRT IS AN ASSET TO MAKE ONESELF DESIRABLE, BUT WHAT IRRITATES ME, ARE ALL THESE MOVEMENTS, THIS GAME, LIKE ‘I HAVE TO SIT THAT WAY TO HIDE MY VAGINA’, ‘I HAVE TO CROSS MY LEGS SO NOBODY CAN SEE MY VAGINA’, ‘MY VAGINA, MY VAGINA, MY VAGINA’. WITH THE MINISKIRT, EVERYTHING BECOMES ABOUT THE VAGINA, IT BECOMES A BIG DEAL, AS IF HIDING IT WAS A BIG DEAL! WHAT DO YOU THINK IS ATTRACTIVE? WHAT CLOTHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MAKE A COME-BACK? SHORTS! THAT’S WHAT I AM TRYING TO SPREAD, SO I MAKE SHORTS RATHER THAN MINISKIRTS, BECAUSE I LOVE WOMEN’S LEGS. IN SHORTS, THEY CAN RUN, JUMP, NOT CROSS THEIR LEGS. SHORTS CAN EVEN BE SHORTER THAN A MINI, WITHOUT MAKING A WOMAN VULNERABLE. ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING EXISTS IN TODAY’S WARDROBE, WE CAN HAVE EVERYTHING, WEAR EVERYTHING, INTERNET SHOWS AND OFFERS US ALL THE OPTIONS… LIKE LADY GAGA! AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING ABOUT LADY GAGA. SHE WEARS EVERYTHING, LIKE SHE WASN’T CHOOSING ANYTHING. I DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW A WHOLE GENERATION CAN RECOGNIZE ITSELF IN HER. THE PERFUME YOU FIND IRRESISTIBLE? L’HEURE BLEUE AND MITSOUKO BY GUERLAIN, WHICH WAS THE FAVORITE PERFUME OF DIAGHILEV. I CREATED TWO PERFUMES FOR MYSELF, WITH FRANCIS KURKDJIAN. I HOPE I CAN SELL THEM ONE DAY. THE TYPE OF WOMAN WHO DRAWS YOUR ATTENTION? I AM FASCINATED BY WOMEN WHO RECREATED THEIR BEAUTY, MORE THAN NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. WHAT TYPE OF VOICE MOVES YOU? THE VOICE OF SINGERS FROM THE 50’S, SUCH AS JUDY GARLAND. MARLENE DIETRICH’S VOICE, WHO I LISTEN TO A LOT BECAUSE SHE HAS A WEIRD VOICE. ANOTHER STORY ABOUT REINVENTING ONESELF: HER VOICE, AT FIRST, ISN’T THAT EXTRAORDINARY, BUT SHE MANIPULATED IT INTELLIGENTLY AND MADE IT SOUND BEAUTIFUL. HER VOICE IS VERY DEEP BUT THANKS TO HER SENSE OF TIMING, HER MODULATIONS, HER ACCURACY, IT’S AMAZING. CURRENTLY, I LOVE THE VOICE OF DOROTHY SQUIRES, IT’S THE VOICE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS LIVED AND WHO PROBABLY DRANK AND SMOKED A LOT. I LOVE IT WHEN SHE SINGS MY WAY. THE THRILL IS HERE. YOU GO THROUGH HER BAG, WHAT DO YOU FIND? MY WIFE’S BAG? I WOULD NEVER GO THROUGH IT! EVERYONE OF US HAS A RIGHT TO PRIVACY. HOWEVER, I COULD ABSOLUTELY GO THROUGH THE BAG OF SOMEONE I DON’T KNOW. YOU, FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU LEFT FOR FIVE MINUTES, I WOULD PROBABLY GO THROUGH YOUR BAG. AND I’D HOPE TO FIND DRUGS, SYRINGES, A GUN, SOME VERY VICIOUS THINGS. ONLY CIGARETTES… INSUFFICIENT. ARE YOU FOOLED BY APPEARANCES? DEFINITELY. SHOES SAY EVERYTHING ABOUT A PERSON. THE LACK OF TASTE YOU CAN FORGIVE? ABSOLUTELY ALL OF THEM. WHAT DO YOU FIND BOLD IN A WOMAN? WHEN SHE IS WARM, WHILE TODAY EVERYBODY HIDES BEHIND A FAÇADE. WHEN SHE ALLOWS HERSELF TO BE VULNERABLE. B&gt;WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR BIGGEST BOLDNESS? WANTING TO PARTICIPATE TO THE WORLD, TO PEOPLE, AND I HAVE DONE IT THROUGH CLOTHES, BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO ME. IT’S VERY EGOCENTRIC. BUT IF YOU WANT TO EXPRESS AN IDEA, YOU NEED SELF CONFIDENCE, AND A SORT OF FEROCITY TO IMPOSE YOURSELF TO OTHERS. I HAVE BEEN AN ALCOHOLIC BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF FEARS, BUT DARING TO INVOLVE, TO BECOME VISIBLE MADE ME STOP DRINKING. YOUR SUMMER 2014 SHOW, WITH THE STEP DANCERS, HAS BEEN PERCEIVED AS VERY BOLD… IT WAS A WAY TO SAY THAT I AM TIRED OF THIS NARROW-MINDED VISION OF BEAUTY, BROADCASTED ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, IN FASHION, IN TELEVISION, IN ADS. OF COURSE I ALSO LIKE BLOND, THIN MODELS, BUT I WANTED TO SHOW ANOTHER FORM OF BEAUTY. NO MATTER HOW WE ARE, WE CAN ALL BECOME SHARP-LOOKING. WITH SOME WORK ON YOURSELF, ANYONE CAN BECOME MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL. WHILE MANY VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN HAVE NO STYLE.

YET AS LUKE LEITCH DISCOVERS, RICK OWENS IS A BREEZE RICK OWENS HAS ASTONISHING NIPPLES, EACH QUITE THE SIZE OF A WEDGWOOD SIDE PLATE. &quot;OH MY,&quot; SAYS THE DESIGNER AS HE RUNS A HAND OVER ONE OF THEM. &quot;IT IS MAGNIFICENT.&quot; WE ARE IN AN INDUSTRIAL UNIT IN PARK ROYAL, NORTH LONDON, WHERE OWENS HAS JUST TAKEN HIS FIRST LOOK AT THE TITANIC STATUE OF HIS TOPLESS TORSO THAT WILL BE WINCHED INTO POSITION ON THE FRONT OF SELFRIDGES THIS WEEKEND. &quot;THIS IS NOT ME,&quot; REPEATS OWENS AS HE CIRCLES IT; NOT BECAUSE THE SCUPLTURE DESIGNED BY DOUGLAS JENNINGS AND HOTHOUSE I WANT GETS HASN&#39;T HEWN AN UNCANNY LIKENESS OF HIS PROMINENTLY NOSED, GYM-HONED SUBJECT (HE HAS) BUT BECAUSE THE DESIGNER IS TRYING TO RATIONALISE THE POSSIBILITY/PROBABILITY THAT HAVING THIS 25FT STATUE SUSPENDED OVER OXFORD STREET MIGHT LEAD SOME TO SUSPECT HE&#39;S A RAGING EGOMANIAC. HIS CLOSEST CONFIDANTE, WIFE AND MUSE MICHÈLE, &quot;ALREADY THINKS I&#39;M TOO BIG FOR MY BRITCHES&quot;. BY CHANCE, SHE ARRIVES AT JUST THIS MOMENT. &quot;HONEY?&quot; SAYS OWENS. &quot;WHAT DO YOU THINK?&quot; SHE JANGLES AROUND A GANTRY, NIMBLE IN A STIFFLY VOLUMINOUS BLACK DRESS, AND AFTER A DEEP INHALATION DELIVERS HER VERDICT THROUGH GOLD-CAPPED TEETH: &quot;I THINK . . . YOU &#39;AVE TO REDO THE NIPPLES.&quot; SELFRIDGES IS A HIGH TEMPLE TO HIGH FASHION. AND SO DESPITE OWENS&#39;S DELICACY, IF ANYONE&#39;S LIKENESS MERITS INSTALLATION ON ITS FACADE, THEN IT IS HIS. FOR AT PARIS FASHION WEEK, WHERE OWENS IS THE SOLE US-BORN DESIGNER TO LEAD HIS OWN HOUSE, THE COLLECTIONS HE PRESENTS ATTRACT AN AUDIENCE MORE CULTISHLY DEDICATED THAN EVEN CHANEL&#39;S. RAIMENTS AS MUCH AS GARMENTS, OWENS&#39;S CLOTHES TYPICALLY TEND TO BE BLACK (VIA THE OCCASIONAL ASIDE INTO GREY OR OTHER SLUDGILY NEUTRAL TONES) AND FALL UNCONVENTIONALLY FROM THE WEARER. HIS DROP-CROTCH SHORTS, REPUTEDLY NON PLUS ULTRA LEATHER JACKETS, AND LOW-HEM VESTS ARE AN INSTANTLY RECOGNISED UNIFORM FAVOURED BY THOSE WHO WISH TO APPEAR CEREMONIALLY UNCONVENTIONAL, VAGUELY AGONISED, AND RADICALLY TASTEFUL. IT IS A CROWD, I&#39;VE NOTICED WEARILY AT HIS SHOWS, THAT TAKES ITSELF JOLLY SERIOUSLY AND RELISHES THE AURA OF MONASTIC OTHERNESS THAT WEARING OWENS LENDS THEM. IN SHORT, THEY CAN BE QUITE UP THEMSELVES. &quot;IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT TOLERANCE, ABOUT EMBRACING EVERYBODY,&quot; HE SAYS, WHEN WE MEET A FEW HOURS AFTER THE STATUE-VIEWING, &quot;BUT WE&#39;VE CREATED THIS THING THAT HAS A WALL THAT KIND OF ELIMINATES A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND I REGRET THAT A LITTLE BIT . . . IT&#39;S BEEN SAID BEFORE THAT MOST PEOPLE TAKE MY CLOTHES MORE SERIOUSLY THAN I DO.&quot; AT HIS SHOW A YEAR AGO, OWENS DUMPED THE USUAL CAST OF WISPY BARELY-THERES FOR A ROBUST SQUAD OF US SORORITY DANCERS THAT DANCED ITS WAY FIERCELY (AND A BIT STOMP-ISHLY) DOWN THE CATWALK. &quot;THERE WAS HUMOUR IN IT, AND IT WAS VERY CHIC BECAUSE THESE GIRLS ARE SAYING, &#39;WE DON&#39;T WANT TO LOOK CUTE FOR YOU. FORGET BEING CUTE, THIS IS WHAT WE DO.&#39;&quot; ALTHOUGH HE WAS HEAPED WITH ACCLAIM FOR SUBVERTING THE NORM OF TALL, THIN AND WHITE MODELS, OWENS SAYS HIS NEXT COLLECTION WILL BE SHOWN MORE PROSAICALLY: &quot;I DON&#39;T WANT TO GET TRAPPED INTO BEING MR SHOWBIZ, OR TO LOSE THAT SENSE OF RESERVE I STARTED OUT WITH.&quot; OWENS WAS RAISED AS AN ONLY CHILD IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, BY HIS SOCIAL WORKER FATHER, JOHN, AND TEACHER MOTHER, CONNIE (WHOSE MEXICAN ROOTS EXPLAIN HIS PEYOTE-SHAMANIC MIEN). HIS CHILDHOOD WAS DIFFICULT, HE SAYS, &quot;BECAUSE I WAS JUST A SMALL-TOWN SISSY, AND THAT TOWN WAS VERY CONSERVATIVE&quot;. WITH NO TELEVISION ALLOWED AT HOME, OWENS DEVELOPED A FONDNESS FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC AND LITERATURE, WHICH FURTHER ALIENATED HIM FROM HIS PEERS. &quot;I GUESS I FELT A LITTLE FORCED,&quot; HE SAYS OF HIS CULTURAL HOTHOUSING, &quot;BUT OF COURSE I&#39;M GRATEFUL NOW. I&#39;M EVEN GRATEFUL FOR THE BULLYING, BECAUSE IT MOTIVATED ME.&quot; ONCE RISEN, OWENS WENT BRIEFLY TO ART SCHOOL WITH AMBITIONS TO BE A PAINTER, BUT LEFT BECAUSE OF THE COST AND LEARNT PATTERN-CUTTING INSTEAD. HIS TWENTIES AND THIRTIES WERE SPENT LIVING ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN LOS ANGELES, WORKING HIS TRADE BY DAY AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY HAUNTING THE LOCAL DEMIMONDE BY NIGHT. &quot;IT WAS VERY DRUGGY AND HUSTLERY, AND SUPER-GLAMOROUS.&quot; IN A RECENT BOOK (WHICH OWENS WILL BE SIGNING AT SELFRIDGES AT 6PM ON SEPTEMBER 13), HE RECOUNTS &quot;THE TRASH AND THE GLAMOUR OF MY FORMATIVE YEARS. IT&#39;S THIS FANTASTIC STORY, OF ALL OF THE DENIZENS OF THE SPOTLIGHT CLUB, THIS BAR . . .&quot; THE LIGHTS CAME UP ON OWENS&#39;S EXTENDED GESTATION PERIOD, HE SAYS, JUST AS HE WAS PUSHING 40. BY THEN, HE HAD MET MICHÈLE LAMY, WHO IS FRENCH AND 17 YEARS HIS SENIOR, INITIALLY AS HER EMPLOYEE (SHE HAD AN EPONYMOUS LABEL IN LOS ANGELES) AND THEN AS HER HUSBAND (OWENS SAYS HE IS BISEXUAL). &quot;VERY MERCURIAL, AND MUCH MORE PUNK ROCKER THAN ME,&quot; MICHÈLE DECIDED TO BECOME A RESTAURATEUR, AND &quot;ABANDONED HER BUSINESS TO HER HUSBAND. SO THEN I STARTED MY OWN THING. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT IT WAS MORE ABOUT MY COURAGE AND MY RECKLESSNESS OF THROWING MYSELF INTO MY DESTINY, BUT IT WASN&#39;T THAT SO MUCH; IT JUST KIND OF . . . IT WAS THE NEXT THING TO DO.&quot; USING HIS EXPERIENCE OF ENGINEERING FABRICS, THE CLOTHES WERE UNORTHODOX FROM THE OFF. &quot;IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO DO IT, MAKE A DIFFERENCE; DO SOMETHING, EXAGGERATE IT. I THINK IT WAS A REACTION TO HELMUT LANG: THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN BE A REBEL IF THE INSIDE LINING HAS A LITTLE DANGLING THING THAT ONLY YOU KNOW ABOUT, BUT YOU GET TO PASS FOR NORMAL.&quot; SHARP-EYED FASHION BUYERS AND SCENEY LOCALS INCLUDING COURTNEY LOVE ADOPTED OWENS&#39;S &quot;GLUNGE&quot; LOOK; HE HELD HIS FIRST FASHION SHOW IN 2001 (GRIPPED BY THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD ENOUGH IDEAS FOR ONLY THREE OF THEM); AND AFTER A PARTNERSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED WITH AN ITALIAN MANUFACTURER, HE AND MICHELE MOVED BACK TO HER HOMELAND A FEW YEARS LATER. THIS SMALL-TOWN, WAGNER-LOVING, HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD PARTY BOY HAS SINCE ESTABLISHED A NICHE AS FASHION&#39;S DISSENTER-IN-CHIEF THAT&#39;S SO LUCRATIVE HE RECENTLY WITHDREW FROM THE PURCHASE OF AN ENTIRE ISLAND IN VENICE ONLY BECAUSE THE ITALIAN BUREAUCRACY WAS SO IMPENETRABLE. HE CHEERILY OWNS UP TO &quot;SELLING REBELLION&quot; - HIS SELFRIDGES STATUE IS MID-THROW OF A MOLOTOV-LIKE BURNING TORCH THAT WILL ERUPT WITH PROPANE FLAMES EVERY 15 MINUTES - BUT DOES AT LEAST OFFER CLOTHES THAT GENUINELY REPRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT OWENS DESCRIBES AS THE MARY TYLER MOORE CONSENSUS IN WOMEN&#39;S FASHION. &quot;WHY ARE WE SEEING MARY TYLER MOORE ON ALL OF THE RUNWAYS? &#39;A-LINE SKIRT, BLOUSE, FLOWERS&#39; - YOU CAN REDUCE A LOT OF FASHION COLLECTIONS TO THAT. POSSIBLY &#39;A-LINE SKIRT, BLOUSE, SEQUINS&#39;, OR SOMETIMES &#39;PENCIL SKIRT&#39;, OR &#39;MINISKIRT&#39;. BUT SO MUCH OF IT IS THAT . . . I WAS MORE &#39;LET&#39;S GO BONKERS AND MAKE SOMETHING RIDICULOUS THAT HITS YOU OVER THE HEAD&#39;.&quot; ANOTHER THING THAT &quot;KIND OF BUGS&quot; HIM IS WHEN DESIGNERS &quot;SEND THESE MODELS OUT WEARING THESE CONCOCTIONS, AND THEN THEY COME OUT [AFTER THE SHOW] IN JEANS AND A SWEATSHIRT. IT MAKES ME CRAZY, BECAUSE YOU ARE SENDING OUT THIS MESSAGE THAT YOU DON&#39;T BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU&#39;RE SAYING.&quot; MODESTLY, OWENS CHARACTERISES HIS SUCCESS AS BEING ACHIEVED THROUGH REPETITION AND CONSISTENCY: &quot;YOU SAY SOMETHING LONG ENOUGH AND PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU&quot;. AND, SURPRISINGLY, HE CITES GIORGIO ARMANI - WHOSE FASHION AESTHETIC IS CLOSE TO A POLAR OPPOSITE OF OWENS&#39;S - AS SOMEONE &quot;I&#39;VE ALWAYS ADMIRED. BECAUSE HE&#39;S VERY CONSISTENT. VERY MUCH ABOUT BEIGE, AND A KIND OF HARD-EDGED SOFTNESS, WITH A LOT OF 30S IN IT - WHICH IS A DECADE I&#39;VE ALWAYS LOOKED TO AESTHETICALLY.&quot; ALTHOUGH AN EXPATRIATE FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS NOW, OWENS HAS NEVER MASTERED FRENCH AS &quot;IT&#39;S JUST TOO HARD&quot;. HE HAS, HOWEVER, BECOME FLUENT AT DEFLECTING PARISIAN FROIDEUR. &quot;WHY DO YOU THINK THE FRENCH ARE LIKE THAT? I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS A CLICHÉ WHEN I MOVED THERE, BUT THEN I REALISED THAT IT&#39;S NOT.&quot; TO EVADE THE SNOOTY CITIZENS OF HIS ADOPTED HOME, HE SAYS, &quot;I IGNORE THEM. YEAH, I DON&#39;T HAVE PATIENCE WITH RUDENESS. I THINK THERE&#39;S JUST NO EXCUSE FOR IT.&quot; GOING BY THE CHILLY DEMEANOUR OF SOME OF HIS FANS, I HAD THOUGHT THAT RICK OWENS WAS GOING TO BE ALOOF. INSTEAD, HE&#39;S A LAUGH, WITH AN EGO FAR, FAR SMALLER THAN HIS SELFRIDGES STATUE.

HERE, HE DISCUSSES RENOVATION, RESPONSIBILITY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ROCKS. VANESSA FRIEDMAN: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THIS BUILDING? RICK OWENS: TWELVE YEARS NOW. WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN, IT HAD DROP ACOUSTICAL TILE CEILINGS WITH FLUORESCENT LIGHTS AND CARPETING AND WALLPAPER, AND WE RIPPED IT ALL OUT. WE DID IT RIGHT BEFORE A SHOW PERIOD, SO WE HADN’T HAD TIME TO SEAL ANYTHING, LIKE THE CONCRETE OR THE WALLS OR ANYTHING, SO THE BOTTOM FLOORS WERE FILTHY AND EVERYBODY, ALL OF THE BUYERS, KNEW WHO HAD BEEN TO THE RICK OWENS SHOWROOM IN PARIS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE WALKING IN THE STREETS COVERED HEAD TO FOOT IN DUST. NOBODY REALLY COMPLAINED. I THINK THEY WERE DELIGHTED A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN EXTREME EXPERIENCE AND THEY PROBABLY FELT LIKE THEY HAD AN ADVENTURE. AS WELL AS SOME ASBESTOS POISONING OR SOMETHING. WAS IT WEIRD TO MOVE FROM HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, WHERE YOU STARTED YOUR CAREER, TO THE SEVENTH ARRONDISSEMENT IN PARIS? YOU ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE ASSEMBLÉE NATIONALE. WHEN WE FIRST MOVED TO PARIS, WE LIVED IN THE MARAIS, AND THERE’S JUST TOO MANY PARTIES WITH ALL OF THOSE KIDS RUNNING AROUND. HERE, IT’S JUST EMBASSIES AND OLD FAMILIES. EVERYBODY IN THIS BUILDING HAS SOME KIND OF ARISTOCRATIC NAME, AND I AM THIS NOUVEAU RICHE AMERICAN THAT’S RUINING THE NEIGHBORHOOD. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS IS GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, AND WE CAN HEAR THE FOOTSTEPS ON THE GRAVEL OF THE GUARDS PATROLLING THE GARDEN. IT’S JUST THE MOST DELICIOUS SENSE OF SECURITY. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO COME TO PARIS? I WAS MANUFACTURING IN ITALY, AND GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ITALY AND LOS ANGELES JUST DIDN’T MAKE SENSE, AND SINCE I’D STARTED SHOWING IN PARIS, IT MADE SENSE TO MOVE EVERYTHING HERE. IT DOESN’T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THERE WERE TIMES THAT I KIND OF FORGET I AM NOT STILL IN LOS ANGELES, BECAUSE I KIND OF CREATE THE SAME TRIANGLE HERE: THE COUPLE OF RESTAURANTS I EAT AT, MY HOUSE AND OFFICE, AND THE GYM. IT’S JUST THAT NOW I WALK THROUGH THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES TO GET TO THE GYM, WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. HAS THE OFFICE CHANGED A LOT SINCE YOU’VE BEEN HERE? THIS ROOM JUST RECENTLY CHANGED. IT USED TO BE VERY DESTROYED, AND THE CEILING WAS KIND OF FALLING APART. IT WAS A LITTLE BOMBED-OUT LOOKING. IT’S ONLY VERY RECENTLY THAT I PLASTERED IT ALL UP AND MADE IT ALL EXTRA SHINY WHITE. AS I GET OLDER, I NEED MORE ORGANIZATION. IT’S NOT BECAUSE OF THE PACE OF FASHION OR ANYTHING, BECAUSE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I’M SO ADDICTED I DON’T THINK I WOULD WANT IT ANY SLOWER. I’M FINE WITH IT BEING FAST. I’M FINE WITH THE DEADLINES AND STUFF. IT GIVES ME A SILLY LITTLE SENSE OF PURPOSE. DID YOU MAKE THE CHAIR AND THE DESK? YEAH. WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN HERE, WE NEEDED A LOT OF STUFF, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FORTUNE. SO I JUST FAKED IT WITH WHAT WE HAD IN HAND. THE CHAIR IS JUST A BOX WITH PILLOWS. I LIKE REDUCING EVERYTHING THAT I DO TO A ROCK AND A FIRE AND A FUR IN A CAVE. SO I’M THINKING, WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIALS? WE NEED A COUPLE OF BENCHES, WE NEED A BED. WHAT ELSE? LIGHT SWITCHES. LIGHT SWITCHES SHOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THEM EVERY DAY. SO YOU KEEP MOST OF THE MATERIALS ON YOUR DESK, OR DO YOU SKETCH? I DON’T SKETCH. I MAINLY DO IT WITH DRAPING. WHAT I DO EVERY SEASON IS ORDER TOILES OF PAST STYLES THAT WE’VE DONE. THEN I MANIPULATE THEM HERE AND TAKE PHOTOS AND SKETCH OVER THEM, OR I DO A LINE, OR PASTE THEM UP TOGETHER, AND THEN THEY SEND ME ANOTHER TOILE AND I MANIPULATE THAT, AND THAT’S HOW WE WORK HERE. RIGHT NOW I’M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE TULLE LOOK LIKE CONCRETE. FASHION IS JUST A FRESH COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS THAT WE ALL CONNECT WITH. THERE’S VERY LITTLE OTHER THAN TULLE ON YOUR DESK. THERE ARE SOME CRYSTALS. I JUST LIKE HOW THEY SEEM KIND OF SPIRITUAL EVEN THOUGH I’M NOT AT ALL. KIND OF SPIRITUAL AND PREHISTORIC. I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THE GRANDEST SCALE POSSIBLE. WHEN I SEE THINGS THAT ARE A LITTLE TOO TRADITIONAL OR THINGS THAT I CAN DEFINE TOO EASILY, IT MAKES ME REACT AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE A SUMMARY OF OUR EXPERIENCES INSTEAD OF JUST ONE FACET. DO YOU LIKE WORKING WHERE YOU LIVE? I DO. I HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE ADVANTAGE OF BEING INDEPENDENT AND THIS BEING KIND OF MY PERSONAL INDULGENCE. I REALLY DO STAY IN MY OWN WORLD. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN WE WERE GROWING WHERE I DID FEEL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT, WHAT ARE PEOPLE RESPONDING TO, WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT? AND I LEARNED THAT THAT WAS A MISTAKE. I LEARNED THAT LISTENING DIDN’T WORK FOR ME. I COULDN’T INTERPRET WELL ENOUGH. I HADN’T DEVELOPED THE SOCIAL SKILLS TO FILTER WHAT WAS VALUABLE AND WHAT WAS DISTRACTION. SO FINALLY I LEARNED THAT I REALLY HAD TO BE COMPLETELY SELFISH AND JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT AMUSED ME, WHAT I ENJOY. BECAUSE PEOPLE SEEM TO RESPOND TO THE THINGS THAT I CONNECT TO THE MOST.

HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS CITY AFTER HAVING LIVED THERE FOR TEN YEARS NOW? WE LIVE RIGHT OFF OF PLACE CONCORDE SO IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE AT THE VERY CENTER OF PARIS— EVERY DAY IS DEFINED BY THE SIGHT OF THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES TO THE RIGHT, THE PONT ALEXANDRE III AND THE TOUR EIFFEL TO THE LEFT, AND THE TROCADERO OFF IN THE DISTANCE LIKE AN ART DECO VALHALLA. I LOVE THE ALOOF ARTIFICE OF PARIS AND HAVE NEVER LEARNED FRENCH TO ENSURE IT NEVER BECOMES TOO FAMILIAR… HOW DID YOU FIND THIS HOUSE AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT? IT HAS QUITE AN INTERESTING HISTORY AFTER ALL, DOESN’T IT? ORIGINALLY BUILT IN THE 18TH CENTURY, A FIVE-STORY ADDITION WAS ADDED TO THE BACK IN THE 1950S. IT WAS MOST RECENTLY THE SOCIALIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS AND A WARREN OF OFFICE CUBICLES THAT WE RIPPED OUT LEAVING THE BARE CONCRETE SHELL. SO THE FRONT IS ALL BOISERIE AND THE BACK IS BRUTALIST. WHAT DID YOU ESPECIALLY LIKE ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU DECIDED TO BUY IT? IT’S A VERY CONSERVATIVE HEAVILY GUARDED AREA FULL OF EMBASSIES. AT NIGHT IT’S A FORTESS OF QUIET WITH JUST THE SOUNDS OF THE FOUNTAINS IN THE GARDENS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, WHICH OUR TERRACE OVERLOOKS. HOW BIG IS THE APARTMENT AND HOW MANY ROOMS DOES IT HAVE? 9000 SQUARE FEET, 15 ROOMS HOW MANY FLOORS DO THE LIVING QUARTERS OCCUPY? YOU’VE ALSO INCLUDED AN ATELIER AND THE FUR DEPARTMENT ON A SEPARATE FLOOR, RIGHT? WE USED TO HAVE OUR SELLING CAMPAIGNS 4 TIMES A YEAR ON THE FIRST 2 FLOORS BUT OUTGREW THE HOUSE AND MOVED THE SHOWROOM TO ANOTHER BUILDING. WE NOW HAVE LIVING AND WORKING SPACES ON THE FIRST 3 FLOORS AND BEDROOMS AND LIBRARY ON THE TOP 2 FLOORS. THE FUR ATELIER OUTGREW THE HOUSE AND HAS MOVED NEXT DOOR. HOW LONG DID THE RESTORATION/CONVERSION TAKE? DID YOU COLLABORATE WITH AN ARCHITECT OR DID YOU DO ALL THE DESIGN WORK YOURSELF? AND WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU DO FIRST? WORKING ON THIS HOUSE IS A PERSONAL PROJECT THAT NEVER NEEDS TO END— RIGHT NOW, I&#39;M LIVING IN VENICE FOR THE SUMMER WHILE THE ELEVATOR IS BEING TAKEN OUT TO MAKE ROOM FOR A BIGGER STAIRCASE. MICHELE GOES BACK AND FORTH SUPERVISING THE WORKMEN. CONSTRUCTION IS ONE OF THE JOYS OF HER LIFE. DID YOU SHARE ALL THE WORK WITH MICHÈLE? WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF WHAT? WE ENJOY VIGOROUS DEBATES ON WHAT TO DO AND THEN SHE EXECUTES OUR PLANS WITH A FRENCH CREW. I ESCAPE TO MY FACTORY IN ITALY DURING THE MOST DISRUPTIVE OR NOISY PERIODS OF CONSTRUCTION.... YOU’VE KEPT QUITE A FEW ROUGH EDGES, UNCOVERED WALLS, RAW CONCRETE CEILINGS ETC. WHAT DO THESE SIGNS OF PURPOSEFUL IMPERFECTION MEAN TO YOU? AND HOW DO THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL DESIGN? WE&#39;VE NEVER LIKED ANYTHING TOO PRISTINE-— OUR AESTHETIC IS A BIT MORE RAW. WHAT’S THE ROLE OF FABRICS AND MATERIALS? WHICH TEXTURES DO YOU PREFER, WHICH MATERIALS DO YOU ESPECIALLY LIKE? WE LOVE CONCRETE, STONE, WAXED PLASTER AND SIMPLE, STRONG LINES. WE HAVE USED SWISS FELT ARMY SURPLUS BLANKETS SPARINGLY AS CARPETS AND CURTAINS. WE’RE BIG FANS OF JOSEPH BEUYS, LE CORBUSIER, JEAN MICHEL-FRANK AND ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS. MUCH LIKE YOUR FASHION COLLECTIONS, YOUR APARTMENT IS ALMOST FREE OF (BRIGHT) COLORS— WHY? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ATMOSPHERE THAT YOU WANTED TO CREATE HERE? COLORS ARE A BIT OF A COMMITMENT FOR ME— I WANT THE MOST SERENELY NEUTRAL AND SPACIOUS ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLE TO HAVE SPACE TO THINK… WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE SPOT IN THE APARTMENT? AND WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A LIVING SPACE? I HAVE AN EMPTY WHITE DRESSING ROOM WITH A DAYBED IN FRONT OF FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOWS THAT OPEN TO HUGE TREES THAT SHADE OUR TERRACE— IT CONTAINS A SMALLER ROOM COMPLETELY LINED WITH BLACK OXYDIZED MARBLE INCLUDING A TOILET IN THE SAME MARBLE THAT TOOK A YEAR TO PRODUCE... I LOVE STARTING MY DAY THERE… WHAT’S THE ROLE OF ART IN AN INTERIOR AND LIVING SPACE? YOU’VE INCLUDED QUITE A FEW OUTSTANDING PIECES IN YOUR QUARTERS, LIKE THE WALL FRESCO OR THE KALINOWSKI SCULPTURE IN THE MEETING ROOM… AND YOUR OWN PIECES ARE CLOSE TO THE LINE BETWEEN ART AND DESIGN AS WELL, IT SEEMS. I&#39;M NOT BIG ON COLLECTING THINGS, BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT JUST FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG. THERE IS A HUGE ART NOUVEAU GEORGES HOENTSCHEL URN IN THE SKYLIGHT ROOM THAT WAS MADE FOR THE FACADE OF THE MUSÉE DES ARTS DÉCORATIFS FOR THE 1900 PARIS WORLD’S FAIR— ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS IN ART HISTORY. HOENTSCHEL DECORATED ROOMS FOR ROBERT DE MONTESQUIOU WHO SUPPOSEDLY WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR PROUST’S BARON DE CHARLUS... I CAN’T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE GLAMOROUS THAN THAT. WE ALSO RECENTLY INSTALLED SOME JEAN PROUVE DOORS AS OUR FRONT DOORS— THEY HAD TO BE SPLIT OPEN TO SANDWICH A THICK GLASS FIRE SAFETY DOOR, AND CUT DOWN TO FIT. OUR PURIST FRIENDS WERE AGHAST BUT THE END RESULT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. THERE ARE GLASS PORTHOLES IN PROUVE&#39;S DESIGN AND YOU WOULDNT GUESS THAT THERE IS A THICK GLASS DOOR INSIDE… WE HAD PROUVE&#39;S ORIGINAL MANUFACTURERS DO THE WORK SO IT FEELS SLIGHTLY RESPECTFUL… WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR WORK HERE ALREADY FINISHED? OR IS IT MORE LIKE AN ONGOING PROJECT, CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND EVOLVING OVER TIME? I&#39;M PRETTY SURE ITS AN EVOLUTION— BUT IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE RAWNESS. HOW DID YOU FIRST COME TO FURNITURE DESIGN? AND WHAT MAKES GOOD DESIGN? WHAT ARE THE KEY ELEMENTS YOU’RE LOOKING WITH YOUR WORK? IF ANYONE COULD CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING AROUND THEMSELVES I THINK THEY WOULD. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE HOUSE ENTIRELY FURNISHED WITH PIERRE CHAREAU AND MALLET-STEVENS BUT BESIDES THE HUGE INVESTMENT, MOST OF THOSE THINGS FEEL A BIT TOO SMALL FOR ME. SO I JUST SET ABOUT MAKING MY OWN DO-IT-YOURSELF SCOTCH-TAPED VERSIONS, MUCH THE SAME WAY AS I STARTED MY CLOTHING COLLECTION 20 YEARS AGO. NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. WHAT’S THE BRIDGE— OR THE GAP— BETWEEN FASHION AND FURNITURE DESIGN? IS IT JUST TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN OR SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FOR YOU? IT’S ABOUT IMMERSING YOURSELF COMPLETELY INTO AN AESTHETIC COMMITMENT. I FEEL THAT THE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY IS ALMOST A MORAL OBLIGATION. AT THE VERY LEAST, BEAUTY IS ONE OF LIFE’S GREATEST REWARDS. WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES TAXIDERMY AND WORKING WITH BONES, ANTLERS AND THE LIKE SO FASCINATING TO YOU? IS IT THE QUEST FOR SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS, ARCHAIC? OR MORE AN AFFINITY TO THE STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL SHAPES FORMED BY NATURE? I LIKE A PRIMAL ELEMENT IN MY WORK— TO ADDRESS AND ENCOMPASS THE ANIMAL AND THE INTELLECTUAL IN ALL OF US.

IT STARTED OUT AS A TALK AND DEMONSTRATION OF MOVEMENT EXPLAINED IN FRENCH, WHICH I DON’T UNDERSTAND VERY WELL – DESPITE HAVING LIVED IN PARIS FOR 12 YEARS; INEXCUSABLE, REALLY. ANYWAY, I WAS SLIGHTLY BORED AND LETTING MY MIND DRIFT WHEN, AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF EARNEST EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION, EVERYTHING SUDDENLY BEGAN TO DEGENERATE – THE SOUND WENT SOUR, THE SIMPLE BLACK BACKDROPS BEGAN TO FOLD IN ON THEMSELVES AND THE HANGING FLUORESCENT LIGHTS WERE SLOWLY SWALLOWED INTO THE CEILING. THE LIGHTS WENT OUT AND SAN MARTÍN’S VOICE DEVOLVED INTO A GROWL AS SHE BEGAN TO DANCE, WRITHE AND TURN INSIDE OUT – THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE HAD A MOUSTACHE. IT WAS THE MOST MARVELLOUS AND SLIGHTLY SPOOKY EXPERIENCE AND WHAT HAD SEEMED SUBURBAN AND PROSAIC SUDDENLY BECAME DISTURBED AND WEIRD. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRED THINGS I’VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. I’VE ARRIVED BACK IN PARIS AFTER TWO MONTHS AT THE LIDO IN VENICE. I DON’T USUALLY STAY THAT LONG BUT THE HOUSE IN PARIS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION; WE ARE HAVING THE ELEVATOR REMOVED TO ENLARGE A VERY SMALL STAIRCASE, WHICH WILL NOW HAVE WINDOWS OPENING ONTO THE GARDEN. IT SEEMED LIKE A SMALL PROJECT TWO YEARS AGO, BUT WITH CITY PERMITS, CO-PROPRIETORS’ APPROVALS AND THE WEATHER, HERE WE ARE, STILL IN RUBBLE. IT TOOK LESS TIME TO BUILD THE EIFFEL TOWER. I FLED TO THE BEACH WHILE HUN STAYED TO BARK AT THE CONSTRUCTION CREW. IT WAS COMPLETELY COWARDLY OF ME BUT I DID HAVE A WOMENSWEAR SPRING/SUMMER RUNWAY COLLECTION TO PREPARE IN ITALY, SO I HAD A GOOD EXCUSE. ANYWAY, I’M BACK AND WE’RE STAYING AT AN APARTMENT NEXT DOOR THAT USED TO BELONG TO DODIE ROSEKRANS, A FRIEND OF OURS WHO WAS A BIT OF A “MARCHESA CASATI” – SHE HAD PLACES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND VENICE TOO, AND WAS ALWAYS DECKED OUT TO THE TEETH IN THE MOST EXTREME COUTURE PARIS COULD CHURN OUT. THIS APARTMENT WAS ONE OF AMERICAN ARTIST TONY DUQUETTE’S LAST PROJECTS AND IS LINED IN EMBROIDERY, SEQUINS, DISTRESSED MIRROR, GOLD LEAF, GOLD LACE AND PROBABLY GOLD SPRAY PAINT, WHICH WAS KIND OF HIS THING – SCOTCH-TAPED GLAMOUR, WHICH I SUPPOSE IS KIND OF MY THING TOO, BUT HE WENT ALL OPIUM-DEN BAROQUE WITH IT. DODIE PASSED ON A FEW YEARS AGO AND THE APARTMENT WAS MOSTLY EMPTIED BUT A LOT REMAINS IN FANTASTIC MISS HAVISHAM-DILAPIDATION. IT’S LIKE LIVING IN A MURKY GUSTAVE MOREAU PAINTING, WHICH IS A BIT DENSER THAN MY USUAL STYLE BUT PROBABLY A HEALTHY BREAK. DAY 2 SEPTEMBER 09 2014 I SPEND THE MORNING LOOKING THROUGH PICTURES OF SHIRTLESS BARTENDERS AND WAITERS FOR A PARTY I’M HAVING WITH SELFRIDGES THIS WEEKEND IN LONDON. WHEN I GO TO A PARTY, I ALWAYS GAUGE HOW BEAUTIFUL THE WAITING STAFF IS – THE MORE ATTRACTIVE THEY ARE, THE MORE GLAMOROUS THE PARTY IS TO ME. THAT IS BREATHTAKINGLY SUPERFICIAL I KNOW, BUT MY BUSINESS IS ALL ABOUT DETAIL. OF COURSE, MY IDEA OF BEAUTY MIGHT BE HARD TO REALISE, AND I’M RECEIVING PICTURES OF MALE STRIPPERS WHEN WHAT I REALLY WANT ARE MALEVOLENTLY GAUNT EGON SCHIELE ANARCHISTS, WITH ACHINGLY SOULFUL EYES – AND BARTENDING EXPERIENCE. THIS PARTY IS TO CELEBRATE MY COLLABORATION WITH SELFRIDGES, WHICH ENTAILS NUMEROUS WINDOWS, A SPACE I’VE CURATED (WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE A GIFT SHOP FOR MY IMAGINARY BURIAL PYRAMID) AND A 25FT STATUE OF MY SHIRTLESS TORSO WIELDING A FLAMING TORCH OVER THE ENTRANCE. I KNOW – RIDICULOUS, RIGHT? IN TRUTH, THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF GIDDY FASHION EXPERIENCE THAT I WOULD ASK FOR IN A DESIGNER SO, WITH SELFRIDGES’ UNBLINKING SUPPORT, WE HAVE THROWN REASON, RESTRAINT AND MODESTY TO THE WIND. AS A THANK YOU TO THE SELFRIDGES TEAM, I’M GIVING EACH OF THEM A SILVER BRACELET IDENTICAL TO THE ONES I WEAR NONSTOP, WITH THEIR NAME AND OUR OPENING DATE ENGRAVED INSIDE. THE WHOLE THING TURNED OUT JUST AS I HAD HOPED, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, AND THIS PARTY IS LA CÉRISE SUR LE GÂTEAU. I’LL BE DOING A BOOK SIGNING THAT AFTERNOON, WHICH I EXPECT WILL STRIP ME OF ANY ALLURE OR SENSE OF MYSTERY I MIGHT HAVE LEFT. I ONLY AGREED TO A PARTY AS IT WOULD GIVE ME AN EXCUSE TO DANCE WITH MY TEAM TO ALL MY FAVOURITE SONGS, IN A BLACKED-OUT, FOG-FILLED CONCRETE BUNKER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I’VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I’LL SAY IT AGAIN: DANCING IS ONE OF LIFE’S SIMPLEST JOYS AND I FEEL A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ENJOY IT. I’VE MADE A PLAYLIST OF ALL MY FAVOURITE MUSIC, WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY HARD TECHNO BUT INCLUDES A FEW OF THE RAUNCHIEST VOGUING TRACKS, AND AS MUCH BY AMERICAN RAPPER LADY AS I CAN FIND. MALE-DOMINATED RAP HAS ALWAYS HAD WHAT I CONSIDER AN UNFORTUNATE ATTITUDE TOWARDS WOMEN, SO I DELIGHT IN FEMALE RAPPERS LIKE LADY TURNING THE TABLES IN THE MOST BRUTALLY LASCIVIOUS WAY. THE DELIBERATE POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS OF IT MAKES IT FEEL DELICIOUSLY DARK AND YET CHEERFUL AT THE SAME TIME – AND MAYBE I’LL TRY A VIOLENTLY CHEERFUL DEATH DROP. OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, VOGUING HAS EVOLVED FROM ELEGANTLY SMOOTH TO A HARSHER, MORE AGGRESSIVE, ALMOST MOSH-PIT EXPERIENCE CULMINATING IN THE DEATH DROP, WHICH IS AN ARTFUL WAY OF SPINNING AROUND AND THROWING YOURSELF INTO A SORT OF BACKWARDS CURTSY, LANDING FLAT ON YOUR BACK WITH ONE ARM FLUNG BEHIND YOU AND ONE LEG EXTENDED, POINTED AT THE SKY. IT’S THRILLING WHEN DONE WELL – AND TOUCHING WHEN ATTEMPTED BY A 52-YEAR-OLD DESIGNER WITH LONG, DYED-BLACK HAIR. DAY 3 SEPTEMBER 11 2014 TODAY I’M FINALISING THE STYLES FOR MY WOMEN’S SPRING RUNWAY SHOW, WHICH WILL BE HELD ON SEPTEMBER 25. AS A SHOW NEARS, PEOPLE OFTEN SYMPATHETICALLY ASK HOW I’M HOLDING UP UNDER THE STRESS AND I HESITATE TO DISPEL THE MYTH THAT CREATION IS TORTURE. I SUSPECT THAT A CHUNK OF YVES SAINT LAURENT’S LEGEND WAS THE DRAMA OF HIS ANGUISH. NO DISRESPECT TO MR YSL – AND I CERTAINLY DON’T PUT MYSELF IN THE SAME LEAGUE – BUT YOU GET WHAT I’M SAYING. I DID EXPERIENCE EARLY ON THE EXTREME DISCOMFORT OF FEELING UNPREPARED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AND WAS SO TRAUMATISED THAT I’LL NEVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. I LIKE TO APPROACH IT ARCHITECTURALLY: THE PLANS FOR A BUILDING HAVE TO BE MADE WELL IN ADVANCE, WITH THE CONSTRUCTION METHODICALLY AND RATIONALLY EXECUTED. IF WHAT I WANT TO PRESENT IS CALM AND LOGICAL ELEGANCE, WOULDN’T I WANT ITS CREATION TO FOLLOW SUIT? I DON’T WANT TO DRAIN THE EMOTION FROM WHAT I’M DOING, JUST THE HYSTERIA. RECENTLY, I MOVED FROM SHOWING IN AN EPIC, INDOOR CONCRETE SPORTS ARENA, WHERE I HAD BEEN DOING PROGRESSIVELY MORE THEATRICAL SHOWS, TO A SERIES OF LARGE ART-DECO HALLS IN THE TROCADÉRO – MY FAVOURITE SPOT IN PARIS, ASIDE FROM THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, WHICH MIRRORS IT. I FELT THAT I HAD COMPLETED A CYCLE; WHAT STARTED WITH ELEMENTAL BACKDROPS SUCH AS FIRE, WIND, CASCADING FOAM AND WAGNERIAN LIGHTING EFFECTS, CULMINATED IN A MEN’S SHOW FEATURING A WEREWOLF SPEED-METAL BAND HANGING UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE CEILING. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A WOMEN’S SHOW, WITH FOUR AMERICAN-SORORITY STEP TEAMS WEARING THE COLLECTION WHILE PERFORMING A BUSBY BERKELEY, TECHNO/TRIBAL DRILL-TEAM ROUTINE – IT WAS A SATISFYINGLY EMOTIONAL HIGH, TAPPING INTO OUR UNIVERSAL LONGING FOR A SENSE OF BELONGING AND UNITY. IMPOSSIBLE TO TOP, AND NOT WANTING TO TRAP MYSELF INTO TRYING TO, I CHANGED VENUES TO CALM EVERYTHING DOWN FOR A MINUTE. I KNOW THAT SOME ARE PROBABLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE LACK OF FIREWORKS IN RECENT SHOWS, BUT I’M SURE OTHERS ARE RELIEVED THEY DON’T HAVE TO INDULGE ME IN MY HISTRIONICS AND HAVE SOMETHING SUBTLER TO RESPOND TO. THE SPRING COLLECTION IS NAMED FAUN (MEN’S AND WOMEN’S COLLECTIONS HAVE THE SAME TITLE) AND REFERENCES CLAUDE DEBUSSY’S L’APRÈS MIDI D_’UN FAUNE – MUSIC I GREW UP LISTENING TO FROM A CULTURAL PERIOD THAT BECAME AN AESTHETIC TOUCHSTONE FOR ME, ENCOMPASSING CUBISM, STÉPHANE MALLARMÉ, LÉON BAKST, THE BALLETS RUSSES AND EARLY-20TH-CENTURY MODERNISM. THE LEGENDARY PREMIERE OF THE BALLET CHOREOGRAPHED BY AND STARRING VASLAV NIJINSKY WAS SET TO THIS MUSIC, AND I WAS THINKING OF THE STORYLINE OF THE FAUN CHASING THE NYMPHS, CLIMAXING WITH THE FAUN MASTURBATING OVER THE SCARF LEFT BEHIND BY ONE OF THEM. A PRIMAL MOMENT CAPTURED IN A STYLISED FORMAL SETTING. IT WAS AN HISTORICAL MOMENT OF THE NEW GUARD ATTACKING THE ESTABLISHMENT – A DRAMATIC DISPLAY OF SOMETHING CRUDE AND BARBARIC THAT MADE WHAT CAME BEFORE IT SEEM DATED AND FUSSY. ARTIFICE AND THE ID ARE A COMBO THAT INFORMS ALMOST EVERYTHING I DO, AND I ALWAYS THINK OF THE SCULPTOR CONSTANTIN BRÂNCUȘI AND PERFORMANCE ARTIST JOSEPH BEUYS TO GET THERE. IMPROBABLY, WHAT ALL THIS BOILS DOWN TO FOR THE WOMEN’S COLLECTION IS FROTH, LITERALLY: I’M WORKING ON SOMETHING DELICATE AND WISPY IN LÉON BAKST’S MUTED COLOURS, FOR A FLEEING, LAUGHING NYMPH. BUT FROTH, COMING FROM ME, AFTER WHAT I MIGHT BE KNOWN FOR, IS ABOUT AS SHOCKING AS I CAN PROBABLY GET. DAY 4 SEPTEMBER 12 2014 TODAY I’M LOOKING FOR DESK CHAIRS. AFTER SEARCHING THIS SUMMER FOR A HOUSE ON THE BEACH IN VENICE FOR MY ITALIAN STUDIO, I FINALLY FOUND A SUITE IN THE HOTEL I STAY AT ON THE LIDO. IT HAS EVERYTHING I NEED: THE PROPORTION OF THE ROOMS, SOLID WOODEN FLOORS, THE RIGHT WALL TEXTURE, CORNER WINDOWS OVERLOOKING THE SEA, A BIG BATHROOM WITH A TERRACE AND, OF COURSE, ROOM SERVICE. SO I’M TAKING IT PERMANENTLY. FOR YEARS I USED TO STAY FOR WEEKS ON END AT A MOTEL OVER A GAS STATION ON THE HIGHWAY NEAR OUR REMOTE FACTORY, TO LEARN HOW TO GET THE RESULTS I WANTED AND IMMERSE MYSELF IN THE SYSTEM AND PACE OF PRODUCING OUR CLOTHES. BEFORE THAT MOTEL WAS BUILT, I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR IN MY OFFICE AT THE FACTORY. BUT AFTER 12 YEARS TOGETHER I FEEL THAT I’VE LEARNT ENOUGH TO TRY WORKING A DIFFERENT WAY – ON THE BEACH. IF THE PAST 12 YEARS WERE ABOUT SURVIVAL, MAYBE THE NEXT 12 CAN BE ABOUT REFINEMENT. I NEVER PUT IMAGES OR ART ON MY WALLS; I NEED A PERPETUALLY BLANK SLATE WHERE EVERYTHING FEELS POSSIBLE. I DO, HOWEVER, HAVE AN ONAGADORI FEATHER TAPED TO THE WALL IN MY FACTORY OFFICE THAT MY JAPANESE PARTNER GAVE ME AFTER LEARNING THAT I COLLECT THEM. ONAGADORI ROOSTERS ARE BRED FOR THEIR LONG TAIL FEATHERS THAT CAN GROW TO 20FT – THEY’RE ONE OF THE MOST À REBOURS THINGS I’VE EVER RUN ACROSS. I LIKE THINGS PRETTY EMPTY, SO THE CHAIRS WILL HAVE A LOT TO LIVE UP TO. THEY NEED TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE SPACE AND HAVE POETIC AND LEGENDARY PROVENANCE, BUT ALSO TREMENDOUS RESTRAINT. THEY NEED TO BE GLAMOROUS BUT LOOK HUMBLE AND AESTHETICALLY SEVERE. I’M AFRAID I EXPECT A LOT FROM A CHAIR. FOR SOMEONE SO CONCERNED WITH MAKING THINGS MODERN, I’M ONLY INTERESTED IN OWNING OLD THINGS WITH HERITAGE. I GUESS IT’S BECAUSE I LIKE TO SEE SOMEONE’S OEUVRE SUMMARISED IN A BEAUTIFUL RELIC AND FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THAT STORY IN MY HAND. IF I WORK HARD ENOUGH, MAYBE I CAN BE THAT FOR SOMEONE ELSE ONE DAY… SO, HERE IN PARIS, MY FIRST STOP IS GALERIE FRANCK LAIGNEAU, WHICH SPECIALISES IN JUGENDSTIL AND ANTHROPOSOPHIC FURNITURE – WEIRD, RARE AND WONDERFUL. HIS INVENTORY LOOKS LIKE IT DRESSED THE SET OF FRITZ LANG’S DIE NIBELUNGEN; A FILM AESTHETIC THAT ANYONE WOULD ASSUME I HAD COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF BUT AMAZINGLY ONLY DISCOVERED A FEW YEARS AGO. BUT MOST OF LAIGNEAU’S PIECES WILL BE IN HIS BOOTH AT THE BIENNALE DES ANTIQUAIRES TOMORROW, SO I’LL WAIT TO SEE THE REST AT THE SHOW. DROOL. NEXT STOP IS A PLACE ON RUE DE LILLE THAT SELLS ORIGINAL AND REISSUED HANS WEGNER PIECES. FINDING AN ORIGINAL SET OF SIX IDENTICAL WEGNER OFFICE CHAIRS IS UNLIKELY, SO A REISSUED ONE IS A PRACTICAL OPTION, BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN’T ORIGINALS WOULD EVENTUALLY GIVE ME AN ULCER SO… NO. AND PROUVÉ AND PERRIAND ARE GREAT, BUT I CAN ENJOY THEM AT EVERYONE ELSE’S HOUSE. I HEAD OVER TO GALERIE ERIC PHILIPPE, WHICH SPECIALISES IN SWEDISH GRACE, A MICRO PERIOD BETWEEN JUGENDSTIL AND NORDIC MODERNISM. THE GALLERY CARRIES A SEVERE, TIGHTLY EDITED SELECTION THAT INSPIRES ME WITH ITS RIGOUR, BUT MAYBE THE SELECTION IS TOO RIGOROUS TODAY… OF COURSE, I HAVE MY OWN CHAIR DESIGNS BUT I WOULDN’T DREAM OF ASKING ANYONE TO SIT IN THEM FOR LONGER THAN A LIGHT LUNCH. AN INTENSE THREE-HOUR MEETING WITH MEAGRE BACK SUPPORT IS ASKING A BIT TOO MUCH OF MY VERY TOLERANT TEAM. RUDOLPH SCHINDLER, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, AND EMILE-JACQUES RUHLMANN ARE MY POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR THE PIECES I MAKE – I DO A FEW SKETCHES AND HUN LABORIOUSLY COAXES THE PIECES OUT OF ALL OF THE ARTISANS IT TAKES TO GET THEM MADE. BUT I’M NOT LOOKING FOR A RELIC FROM MY OWN STORY, SO THE HUNT GOES ON… DAY 5 SEPTEMBER 13 2014 FRIDAY NIGHT IS A SEDATE START TO THE WEEKEND. MY PARTNER HUN AND I ARRIVE IN LONDON AND HAVE DINNER WITH SOME FRIENDS, OLD AND NEW. HUN NEVER TELLS ME WHO SHE’S INVITED SO THERE ARE ALWAYS LOVELY SURPRISES. FIRST, THERE IS MICHAEL KAPLAN, AN OLD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES WHO IS IN LONDON DESIGNING THE COSTUMES FOR THE NEXT STAR WARS MOVIE (I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THE EPIC TOUR HE GAVE ME OF THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT AT PINEWOOD STUDIOS). THEN THERE IS THE JEWELLERY DESIGNER LOREE RODKIN, ANOTHER LOS ANGELES FRIEND WHO’S IN TOWN TO MAKE A PERSONAL APPEARANCE WITH HUN AT DOVER STREET MARKET. THEY ARE INTRODUCING A COLLABORATIVE COLLECTION OF RINGS AND BRACELETS CALLED HUNROD – PIECES THAT HUN HAS BEEN WEARING AND CREATING WITH LOREE FOR YEARS. GARETH PUGH ALSO JOINS US, HAVING JUST RETURNED FROM PRESENTING A MULTIMEDIA FASHION MINDWARP AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK, AS DOES JAIMAL ODEDRA, A MULTITALENTED DESIGNER WHO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH HUN ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A BRONZE, BONE AND STERLING TABLEWARE COLLECTION THAT I ALWAYS SAY HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO COORDINATE WITH HER GOLD-PLATED TEETH. LASTLY, THERE IS THE VENERATED AND ELEGANT AMERICAN GARDEN DESIGNER MADISON COX AND BRITISH SINGER-SONGWRITER FKA TWIGS AND HER POSSE. I WASN’T FAMILIAR WITH FKA TWIGS, AND COULD KICK MYSELF FOR BEING SO UNAWARE. SHE’S A BEAUTY WITH A UNIQUE AND FULLY RESOLVED AESTHETIC, AND A JAZZ SINGER’S VOICE SET TO AN ELECTRONIC SOUNDSCAPE. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND GOOGLE HER. ON SATURDAY I HAVE A BOOK-SIGNING AT SELFRIDGES, WHICH IS SOMETHING NEW FOR ME. I’M MORE OF A BACKSTAGE GUY, SO RESPONDING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IS NOT IN MY COMFORT ZONE. BUT IF YOU CAN ARRANGE TO BE IN A CROWD OF PEOPLE WHO ALL SEEM TO LIKE YOU, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! THE TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF GOODWILL AND WARMTH IS SOMETHING I FEEL A BIT GUILTY FOR ENJOYING SO MUCH. THE DAY CULMINATES IN THE PARTY, WHICH CAPS OFF OUR SELFRIDGES COLLABORATION GORGEOUSLY. THE CASTING OF OUR WAITING AND BARTENDING STAFF REAPS GREAT REWARDS – THE GANG OF SHAVEN-HEADED AND SHAGGY, HALF-NAKED HOOLIGANS STRIKES JUST THE RIGHT NOTE OF ATTRACTIVE MENACE EVERY HOST DREAMS OF. GUESTS ARRIVE BY WALKING UP A RAMP (FLANKED BY TWO LIVE WHITE HORSES, OF COURSE) LEADING TO AN EMPTY CONCRETE PARKING AREA AT THE TOP WITH CLOUDS OF FOG BILLOWING OUT OF ITS ENTRANCE. THE AREA IS UNLIT EXCEPT FOR A GRID OF BRIGHT WHITE LASERS THAT SPLIT THE SPACE IN HALF, OBLIGING GUESTS TO WALK THROUGH A WALL OF LIGHT – AN EFFECT I USED IN ONE OF MY RUNWAY SHOWS. THE MUSIC IS BY BYETONE, WHO PROVIDED THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE STEP-TEAM DANCE ROUTINE AT MY SPRING 2014 SHOW IN PARIS LAST SEPTEMBER. HE AND THE ARTIST CARSTEN NICOLAI ARE CO-CREATORS OF THE GERMAN ELECTRONIC-MUSIC LABEL RASTER-NOTON, WHICH REPRESENTS ALVA NOTO, EMPTYSET, RYOJI IKEDA AND MORE. THEY HAVE ALL CREATED EXCLUSIVE VIDEO AND MUSIC COMPILATIONS FOR THE SPACE, WHICH IS MAGNIFICENTLY DOMINATED BY RYOJI’S LIGHT AND SOUND INSTALLATION. (LAST MONTH, RYOJI’S SPECTRA LIT UP THE LONDON SKY IN A FIRST-WORLD-WAR COMMEMORATION THAT WAS AN EVOLUTION OF A PIECE I SAW IN DUBAI LAST YEAR.) THE PURITY AND RIGOUR OF THE AESTHETIC UNIVERSE RYOJI AND BYETONE CREATE IS WHAT MAKES ME SUCH A COMMITTED FAN. ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON I HAVE A QUICK MEETING WITH MY ITALIAN-STUDIO TEAM, WHO ARE IN LONDON TO ATTEND LAST NIGHT’S PARTY AND TO REVIEW NEXT WEEK’S PARIS FASHION WEEK RUNWAY PRODUCTION. THEN IT’S TIME TO HEAD HOME TO PARIS.

IT BECOMES MORE PRONOUNCED ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL STARTS BUYING THEM. TYPICALLY, IT WOULD START WITH EITHER A SIMPLE T-SHIRT, A PAIR OF BASKETBALL BOOTS, OR ONE OF HIS SIGNATURE LEATHER JACKETS. THE T-SHIRT – THAT MOST BASIC ITEM OF EVERYONE’S WARDROBE – OFFERS YOU A DEPARTURE POINT FROM THE NORM AND ENTRY IN TO THE WORLD OF RICK, AS THE FASHION COGNOSCENTI LIKE TO REFER TO HIM. IT IS A SEMI-TRANSLUCENT NEUTRAL COLOR THAT IS SO FINELY WOVEN IT RESEMBLES A 15-DENIER STOCKING. IT IS LONG ENOUGH TO REACH YOUR MID-THIGH. YOU PUT IT ON FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WOULD BE FORGIVEN IN THINKING, “THIS ISN’T A T-SHIRT, IT’S MORE LIKE A DRESS.” AND THEN, AS YOU HURRIEDLY BEGIN TO REMOVE IT, THE EXCESS FABRIC CREATES SHAPE AROUND YOUR TORSO. YOU CATCH YOURSELF IN THE CHANGING ROOM MIRROR AND REGISTER SURPRISE AT WHAT YOU SEE. THE EARLIER CONFUSION IS SWAPPED FOR ADMIRATION AS YOU NOTICE THE RUCHED MATERIAL GATHERING AT THE WAIST. NOW, THE T-SHIRT LOOKS DISHEVELED; IT DOESN’T HANG STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE HEM ANYMORE. INSTEAD, IT’S WORKING WITH YOUR SHAPE. THIS T-SHIRT IS ANYTHING UPWARDS OF $220 — RIDICULOUS, YET, YOU ARE STRANGELY COMPELLED. IF YOU DON’T LEAVE THE STORE WITH IT THIS TIME, IT’S A GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT IT. NEXT, THE BOOTS. CATCHING THE EYE WITH THEIR BULBOUS TOECAP AND HEAVY CHROME SIDE ZIP, THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE IS THE LEVEL OF QUALITY INVOLVED. THE FACT THAT IT’S ALL-LEATHER, INCLUDING THE INTERIOR, MAKES FOR A SUPREMELY COMFORTABLE FIT. AS YOU SLIP IT ON, IT ENVELOPS YOUR FOOT AND FEELS SO RIGHT — NOT LIKE A BRAND NEW SHOE THAT WILL NEED TIME TO WEAR IN, MORE LIKE AN OLD FAVORITE. AND, IT IS HEAVY – WEIGHTIER THAN A SPORTS SHOE OR MILITARY APPAREL HAS ANY RIGHT TO BE. WALKING IN THEM INITIALLY MAKES YOU PIGEON-TOED; IT’S ALMOST LIKE A CONCRETE SOLE. YOU JUST KNOW IT’S GOING TO COST. CORRECT AGAIN – THE HIGHER THE PRICE, THE GREATER THE DESIRE. THE “EFFECT” HERE IS THAT YOU SOON BEGIN TO CONSIDER THESE GARMENTS AS THE NORM. THEY STARTED OUT APPEALING TO YOU BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING ELSE. AND, BEFORE LONG, YOU FIND YOURSELF WANTING TO MULTIPLY THOSE FIRST- BUY ITEMS IN TO SEVERAL MORE OF THE SAME. REGULAR T-SHIRT LENGTHS NOW SEEM INADEQUATE; CANVAS BASKETBALL SNEAKS ARE RELEGATED TO YOUR ADOLESCENT PAST. IT IS QUITE COMMON FOR THE KEENEST RICK OWENS CUSTOMERS TO BUY MORE THAN ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE LEATHER JACKET STYLES. THIS SEASON’S CLASSIC “STOOGERS” BIKER JACKET IS A STRONG CONTENDER WITH ITS BOILED CASHMERE LINING THAT DROPS BELOW THE JACKET HEM. IN A MATTER OF YEARS, IT’S JUST POSSIBLE THAT RICK OWENS WILL DOMINATE YOUR WARDROBE. BUT FOR A HANDFUL OF NOTABLE DESIGNERS – YAMAMOTO, DEMEULEMEESTER, EARLY RAF SIMONS, AND THE OCCASIONAL MARGIELA PIECE – HIS PROPORTIONS ARE ALMOST INCOMPATIBLE WITH MOST OTHER FASHION LABELS SO THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO MIX THEM. IT’S AS WELL, THEN, THAT HE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS SUCH LOYAL FOLLOWERS, WHOM HAVE NOW GROWN EXPONENTIALLY IN TO A GLOBAL TRIBE, WITH CONSISTENTLY STRONG COLLECTIONS. MUCH OF THAT IS DOWN TO A REFINED TASTE LEVEL THAT PRODUCES A CONSTANTLY SATISFYING “JUST SO” IMPRESSION WHEN YOU TRY ON THE CLOTHES. GENEROUS DETAILS INCLUDE DEEP POCKETS AND THE LENGTHY WAIST CORD THAT IS A DESIGN FEATURE IN ITSELF. THE SHAPES MAY BE DRAMATIC, BUT MOST OWENS GARMENTS NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT CLOTHES SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. HIS KNITWEAR AND JERSEY COTTON ARE SO COMFY, THEY COULD EASILY FUNCTION AS SLEEPWEAR. IN 20 YEARS, THIS STRATEGY HASN’T CHANGED AT ALL. FROM HIS EARLIEST DAYS ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, CALIFORNIA – LONG BEFORE THE AREA BECAME GENTRIFIED WITH ITS CURRENT GAUCHE CONSUMER ORIENTATION – RICK OWENS STARTED OUT WITH ELONGATED SLOUCHY T-SHIRTS AND LEATHER JACKETS IN WHICH THE HIDES APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SCARRED. AND, DESPITE SIGNIFICANTLY GROWING THE CLOTHING RANGE SINCE, THESE REMAIN HIS PERENNIAL BESTSELLERS. BETTER YET, NO OBVIOUS DESIGNER TAGS ARE ON DISPLAY TO IDENTIFY THE GARMENT AS A RICK OWENS PIECE. THERE IS A RELATIVELY SHORT LEARNING CURVE IN RECOGNIZING HIS DESIGNS. AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN’T MEANDERED TOO FAR FROM THOSE FIRST YEARS. HIS PATTERN-CUTTING TECHNIQUE, HONED DURING SEVERAL YEARS WORKING IN DESIGNER KNOCK-OFF WORKSHOPS IN LA’S GARMENT DISTRICT, STANDS OUT AMONGST THE RACKS OF OTHER LABELS IN A DESIGNER STORE. AND, IN THAT RESPECT, WHILST THE LABEL IS NOW CONSIDERED IN THE PREMIUM LEAGUE OF HIGH FASHION, OWENS’ ORIGINS WERE ALWAYS ANTI-FASHION AND REASSURINGLY NON-CONFORMIST. IT IS A BRILLIANT EXAMPLE OF BRAND MARKETING AND COULD ONLY COME FROM SOMEONE WHO POSSESSES A STRONG BELIEF IN WHAT HE DOES. SO, RICK OWENS, THEN. IN PERSON, HE IS NATURALLY FRIENDLY AND OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. LIKE HIS MENSWEAR, HE IS TALL, LEAN AND JUST A LITTLE BIT LOUCHE, WHILST HIS AQUILINE FEATURES GIVE HIM A SERENE AIR OF NOBILITY. DESPITE LIVING IN PARIS SINCE 2003, HE RETAINS THAT UNMISTAKABLY LANGUID CALIFORNIAN ACCENT AND THE SOFT, DRAWN-OUT VOWELS HAS THE EFFECT OF IMMEDIATELY RELAXING ANYONE IN HIS COMPANY. HOWEVER, IT IS HIS BONE-DRY HUMOR AND SELF-DEPRECATING COMMENTS THAT LEAVE THE MOST LINGERING IMPRESSIONS. HE CAN BE DISARMINGLY MODEST OR WICKEDLY FUNNY. AND THE DELIVERIES ARE OFTEN SO SUBTLE YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE TAKE FOR FACIAL CLUES TO SEE IF HE REALLY DID MEAN WHAT HE JUST SAID. TO OFFSET THIS, HE ENJOYS TALKING ABOUT MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE, LEADING EDGE ELECTRONICA AND A SELECT ROSTER OF ARTISTS THAT HE ENJOYS COLLECTING. AS THE BUSINESS HAS FLOURISHED, HE HAS BEEN PRESENT IN VARIOUS GLOBAL ART FAIRS. AFTER WHICH, A FLAGSHIP STORE HAS SOMETIMES OPENED, SUCH AS IN MIAMI’S DESIGN DISTRICT LAST DECEMBER, HOME OF THE ANNUAL ART BASEL EVENT. THERE IS ALSO THE FURNITURE LINE HE PRODUCES – MORE OF WHICH, LATER. AT 51 YEARS, THERE ISN’T THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF SETTLING FOR A PAIR OF CHINOS AND COLORFUL POLO SHIRT LIKE MOST MIDDLE-AGED MEN WOULD DO. OWENS STILL TRIES ON EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THE DESIGN STUDIO AND IT’S IMMEDIATELY CLEAR THESE ARE CLOTHES PRIMARILY DESIGNED FOR HIM TO WEAR. THIS, TOO, REQUIRES A SPECIAL KIND OF CONFIDENCE – A RESILIENT BELIEF THAT ANYONE ELSE WOULD WANT TO EMULATE THE LOOK. AS HE HIMSELF EXPLAINS, “THIS LABEL IS ABOUT ONE PERSON’S VERY PERSONAL EXPRESSION AND PRESENCE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE. I KNOW THAT THAT’S WHAT I WANT IN A DESIGNER.” THIS HAS NOT GONE UNNOTICED BY HIS LEGIONS OF FOLLOWERS AND, IN TURN, HAS ELEVATED HIS STATUS TO A CULT FIGURE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS FOR THIS, NOT LEAST THE FACT THAT THE RICK OWENS BRAND HAS DEFIANTLY EVADED THE LURE OF ANY LARGE CORPORATE GIANT TO DO HIS BIDDING. EVEN THE MOST CASUAL OBSERVER WOULD SOON APPRECIATE THAT EVERY PRODUCT, EVENT, AND PRESENTATION OUT OF THE RO STABLE IS HANDWRITTEN BY ONE MAN AND HIS TIGHT-KNIT CIRCLE OF CONTRIBUTORS. TO AMPLIFY THIS LEVEL OF ARTISTIC INDEPENDENCE, THE CLOTHES IMPLY AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ELEMENT – SOMETHING HE HAS MENTIONED REPEATEDLY. AND, IF IT HAS RESONATED POWERFULLY AMONGST THE STYLE CONSCIOUS, THAT’S BECAUSE THEY SUGGEST A LIFE LIVED AT THE MARGINS, UPSCALED WITH PREMIUM MATERIALS. MAINTAINING BUT NEVER QUITE RESOLVING THAT TENSION BETWEEN PENTHOUSE AND PAVEMENT. HERE IS WHERE THE STORY GETS INTERESTING. THE RO AESTHETIC HARDWIRES DIRECTLY INTO A ROMANTIC NOTION OF YOUR OWN ADOLESCENCE. THE COMPLETE ROCK ‘N’ ROLL FANTASY – TOO YOUNG TO DIE, ETC. EXPERIMENTING WITH EVERYTHING... DRUGS, SEX, ILLICIT INDULGENCES. ALLOWING THE RAW ENERGY OF NEW MUSIC TO SHAPE YOUR PERSONALITY. IT ISN’T ABOUT BEING SMARTLY DRESSED AND IMPECCABLY MANNERED TO SATISFY YOUR PARENTS, IT’S ABOUT COMING FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS AND TAKING PRIDE IN THAT. THE UBIQUITOUS BAD BOY: DIRTY JEANS, RIPPED HOLES IN YOUR T-SHIRT, AND A BADLY SCUFFED LEATHER JACKET. THIS AMBIENCE IS THE DNA OF ALL RICK OWENS CLOTHING. AND HE HAS OPENLY DISCUSSED HIS EARLY ADULTHOOD, THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SEX CLUBS. THIS ISN’T “DESIGNER” SPORTSWEAR BECAUSE THE HEAD OF MARKETING, OR THE TREND-FORECASTERS HAVE DECREED IT AS IMPORTANT, IT’S COMING FROM A GENUINE LIVED-IN EXPERIENCE. AND THIS INTEGRITY IS INHERENT, NOT ASSUMED. YET IN PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS, OWENS HAS REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS A “SISSY BOY,” THE ONLY-CHILD OUTSIDER WHO WAS DENIED ACCESS TO TELEVISION UNTIL HE REACHED 16. INSTEAD, HE IMMERSED HIMSELF IN THE FAMILY LIBRARY, ABSORBING HIGHBROW PHILOSOPHY, EUROPEAN LITERATURE AND DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR EPIC OPERA. THE CHANGE CAME AFTER THAT. A PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION THAT HE DESCRIBES AS “EVERYTHING I DO IS A VERY CLICHÉD REACTION TO A VERY CONTROLLED CHILDHOOD. AS SOON AS I WAS ABLE TO, I LOST CONTROL AS SPECTACULARLY AND THEATRICALLY AS I COULD.” IN TERMS OF THE CLOTHES HE DESIGNS, IN PARTICULAR, THE EMPHASIS ON EXCESS PROPORTION AND LAYERING, HE ELABORATES. “I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT EXTENDING BEYOND YOUR LIMITS THAT I WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTED TO – BEING BIGGER, LONGER, DRAGGING THINGS BEHIND YOU, FILLING MORE SPACE, FALLING APART, RECKLESS GESTURES... WITH A TOUCH OF OPULENCE.” OWENS WON’T BE DRAWN IN TO ANY COMMENT ON THE WAKE OF MENSWEAR DESIGNERS THAT HAVE EMERGED SINCE HE FIRST ENTERED THE MARKETPLACE. INDEED, AN ENTIRE STRAND OF MENSWEAR HAS GROWN; NAMES SUCH AS BORIS BIDJAN SABERI, DAMIR DOMA, YOHAN SERFATY, THOM KROM AND MA+ ALL ESCHEW THE CONVENTIONAL IDEA OF TAILORED CLOTHING. THEY SHARE A RELIANCE ON CASUAL SPORTSWEAR AND SHOES THAT INCORPORATE LUXE FABRICS AND A DISTRESSED LOOK. EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT IS THE RESPONSE HIS DESIGNS HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE SPORTS APPAREL INDUSTRY. ALONGSIDE THE OBVIOUS MILITARY WEAR INFLUENCE, OWENS’ DESIGN SIGNATURE IS LARGELY DUE TO HIS UNIQUE INTERPRETATION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN SPORTSWEAR. THESE ARE THE TOTEM POLES OF EVERY RICK OWENS COLLECTION. THAT HE CAN PRESENT A BASIC SINGLET WITH ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN EVENING TUXEDO IS ONE THING. BUT IT IS THE ONGOING RELATIONSHIP HE CARRIES WITH THE BUYING PUBLIC, OFFERING THEM ELONGATED VERSIONS OF BASKETBALL SHORTS, TOPS AND BOOTS IN LEATHER RATHER THAN PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING MATERIALS THAT HAS GENERATED THE REPEAT CUSTOM. THE TAKE-UP HAS BEEN UNANIMOUS, AND FURTHER CONSOLIDATED BY SEVERAL KEY HIP-HOP MOGULS, DJS AND FILM CELEBRITIES ACTIVELY ENDORSING HIS CLOTHES IN THE PUBLIC EYE. MORE RECENTLY, THE SPORTS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN PAYING EQUALLY CLOSE ATTENTION. NOTICE HOW THEIR DIMENSIONS, IN PARTICULAR THE SHOES, HAVE GROWN IN RECENT YEARS. WIDER, TALLER, THICKER – APPROACHING SIMILAR PROPORTIONS TO THE CLASSIC RO GEOBASKET BOOT. MERE COINCIDENCE? NOT WHEN HIGH VISIBILITY STARS SUCH AS A$AP ROCKY ARE REGULARLY NOTED IN OWENS’ CLOTHES. MENTION THIS TO HIM AND HIS MODEST RESPONSE IS, “I DON’T THINK I REALLY INVENTED ANYTHING. I WAS JUST ABLE TO EXPRESS WHAT WE WERE ALL MAYBE IN THE MOOD FOR.” INSTEAD, HE EXPRESSES SLIGHT REGRET AT HAVING REMAINED OUTSIDE OF THE FASHION COMMUNITY, AND ONLY BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED BY THE LEGENDARY PHOTOGRAPHERS: “OUR HORSTS, OUR AVEDONS OR OUR PENNS.” AFTER TWO DECADES OF BUSINESS AND EIGHT YEARS SINCE OFFICIALLY LAUNCHING A MENSWEAR LINE, WHERE DOES RICK OWENS STAND IN THE MARKET TODAY? ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED INDUSTRY FIGUREHEADS TO COMMENT ON THIS WOULD BE LN-CC.COM’S FOUNDER, JOHN SKELTON. AN ENTHUSIASTIC CHAMPION FROM THE OUTSET, HE INTRODUCED THE LINE TO SELFRIDGES, HARRODS AND OKI-NI.COM BEFORE SETTING UP HIS OWN STORE IN LONDON FIVE YEARS AGO. “RICK OWENS HAS REALLY SHOWN WHAT A PROGRESSIVE DESIGNER HE IS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. AT A TIME WHEN THE BLACKED-OUT VIBE LITERALLY DIED AT THE PREMIUM END, HE HAS UPDATED NOT ONLY HIS USE OF COLOR AND FABRICATIONS, BUT ALSO HIS SILHOUETTES, WHILST MANY OTHER BRANDS ARE COPYING HIS ORIGINAL ONES. SHORTER SHORTS, MORE TAILORING, AND SLEEKER FOOTWEAR TWINNED WITH MORE SOLID CUTS OF TEES AND KNITWEAR, KEEPING THE BRAND RELEVANT AT A TIME WHERE SIMPLICITY AND PURISM LEADS THE WAY IN FORWARD-THINKING DESIGN. THE LABEL REMAINS AS STRONG AS EVER, REGARDLESS OF THE GROWTH ACHIEVED. AND THE LOOK, WHILST KEEPING ITS ANGST AND STRENGTH, IS A LOT MORE REFINED IN TERMS OF SHAPES AND CUT.” WHEN THE GERMAN SPORTSWEAR GIANT, ADIDAS ANNOUNCED THEY WERE PRODUCING A CAPSULE LINE OF SPORTS SHOES WITH OWENS IN 2013, THE DESIGNER QUIPPED THAT HE’D WANTED TO TAKE UP RUNNING SO DISCUSSIONS BEGAN. “I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, ‘WHAT SHOES AM I GOING TO WEAR?’ I CAN’T WEAR MY BIG CHUNKY BASKETBALL SHOES... I’D LOOK LIKE A DINOSAUR RUNNING THROUGH THE TUILERIES.” PUBLIC RECEPTION WAS MIXED. RICK AFICIONADOS GUSHED OVER THE ONLINE BLOGS, WHILST TRADITIONAL SNEAKER HEADS RAMPED UP THEIR SNARK. THE DESIGNS WERE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT AND JUST AS UNCOMPROMISING. HAD HE WANTED TO SIMPLY GENERATE SOME EXTRA INCOME, HE COULD HAVE OFFERED ADIDAS LICENSE TO REPLICATE HIS EXISTING DESIGNS IN A VARIETY OF COLORS. AND LET THEM TAKE CARE OF MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION. BUT, GIVEN THEIR HISTORY OF DESIGNER COLLABORATIONS AND OWENS’ CONSTANT STRIVING FOR NEW INTERPRETATIONS, THAT WAS UNLIKELY. A PREVIOUS COLLABORATION WITH EASTPAK WAS A ONE-OFF; IT WAS DIFFERENT WITH ADIDAS AND NEXT SPRING’S SPRINGBLADE DESIGN IS HIS MOST FUTURISTIC YET. HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP: “THE ADIDAS THING WAS REALLY ABOUT DEVELOPING AN ALTERNATE SILHOUETTE TO MY SHOE SHAPE, WHICH I STILL LOVE BUT NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD. A RUNNING SHOE SHAPE WAS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I DO, SO IT SEEMED RIPE FOR CORRUPTION. IT WASN’T ANY BIG PR STRATEGY, I JUST DIDN’T WANT TO TRY AND REINVENT THE WHEEL. THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE PERFORMANCE SPORTS SHOES BETTER THAN I DO AND THEY GAVE ME EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. BELIEVE ME, I’M THE FIRST TO DISMISS COLLABS AS HYPE, BUT THIS WAS HONESTLY ABOUT FINDING A DESIGN SOLUTION. I DO HESITATE TO DEVELOP IT FURTHER BECAUSE IT BECAME A BIT MORE VISIBLE THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD AND I WOULD HATE TO COME OFF LIKE I WAS MILKING IT... BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT THE ADIDAS GUYS ARE REALLY NICE, EASY, TALENTED PEOPLE.” EARLIER IN 2003 ANOTHER IMPORTANT TRANSFORMATION HAD TAKEN PLACE. THE YEAR BEFORE, U.S. VOGUE HAD APPROACHED THE DESIGNER AND OFFERED TO SPONSOR A CATWALK SHOW DURING NEW YORK FASHION WEEK. IT WAS MORE PROFESSIONAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAN HE HAD EXPECTED, BUT HE RESISTED THE URGE TO DECLINE THE ESTABLISHMENT CALLING AND WENT WITH IT. THIS PRECEDED A MOVE TO PARIS AND A FURTHER CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THE LIFESTYLE EXCESSES OF WEST HOLLYWOOD WERE EXCHANGED FOR A MORE RIGOROUS STRUCTURE. STUDIO IN THE MORNING, REGULAR TRIPS TO THE GYM AT MIDDAY, AND THEN BACK TO WORK UNTIL THE EVENING. AS IF A SWITCH WAS FLIPPED OVERNIGHT, THE RICK OWENS BRAND TOOK ON ITS OWN DESTINY TO BECOME A SERIOUS CONTENDER IN THE FASHION WORLD. AGAIN, IN CONVERSATION, OWENS DESCRIBES THIS PERIOD AS AN EMBRACING OF THE RITUALISTIC. THAT HE IS ATTRACTED TO THE BETTERING OF THE SELF, THE ASPIRATION IN WANTING TO CONSTANTLY IMPROVE IS HEROIC AND PERFECTLY ATTAINABLE, HE BELIEVES. YOU SEE THIS IN HIS CATWALK SHOWS – LEGIONS OF MALE WARRIORS STRIDING TOWARDS YOU, CLAD IN MODERN DAY UNIFORMS OF THE NOBLE. YOU ALSO CAN RECOGNIZE THIS IN HIS OTHER DESIGN OUTPUT – A FURNITURE LINE THAT HAS BEEN IN REGULAR PRODUCTION SINCE 2007 AND THE STORE INTERIORS THAT RESEMBLE ABANDONED UNDERGROUND BUNKERS. NOW AT SEVEN FLAGSHIP STORES WORLDWIDE, THEY CONTAIN THE FURNITURE THAT CONTINUES HIS FASCINATION WITH EXAGGERATED PROPORTION AND TEXTURE. THEY ALLOW THESE BARREN ENVIRONMENTS A SENSE OF DECADENCE AND LUXURY. PLAYING OFF THE AGGRESSIVE STIPPLED WALLS THAT RESEMBLE STALACTITES IN SOME ULTIMATE FANTASY SEX DUNGEON, THE FURNITURE ECHOES THE PERSONALITY OF HIS CLOTHING. A GIANT NINE-FOOT DAYBED COULD EASILY DOUBLE UP AS A SKATE PARK RAMP. THE CHANGING ROOM DRAPES ARE HEAVY CASHMERE AND THE SEATING IS UPHOLSTERED IN BATTERED SUEDE. FINALLY, OWENS CANNOT RESIST SOME OF THE DARK HUMOR HE IS RENOWNED FOR... IN THE LONDON STORE, A SEVERED HEAD, ACCURATELY MODELED ON HIS OWN, COMPLETE WITH LONG BLACK HAIR, SITS ON TOP OF A CONCRETE PILLAR, STARING PASSIVELY DOWN AT THE TILL POINT. IN TOKYO, THE PERFECT REPLICA TORSO MORPHS INTO A GODZILLA CLAW, THE “RICKZILLA.” OWENS CLEARLY ENJOYS THE PROMISE OF GROTESQUE TRANSFORMATION IN BOTH HIMSELF, AND THE MANY CLOTHES AND OTHER PRODUCTS HE DESIGNS FOR OTHERS.

OWENS, ARE YOU AN EASY PERSON TO LIVE WITH? IT’S HARD FOR SOMEBODY TO LIVE WITH ME, I THINK. I’M VERY INFLEXIBLE AND THAT CAN’T BE EASY. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I PUT UP A WALL AND I SAY, “THIS IS WHAT I WANT AND I’M NOT GOING TO DEBATE IT OR NEGOTIATE IT,” AND I KNOW THAT THAT MUST BE UNPLEASANT. IF I WERE LIVING WITH ME, I WOULD GET SICK AND TIRED OF IT ALWAYS BEING ABOUT RICK OWENS THIS, RICK OWENS THAT. SO HOW DOES YOUR WIFE MICHELE DEAL WITH THAT? MICHELE HAS LEARNED HOW TO DEFINE HER SPACE, AND THAT’S KIND OF GREAT. SHE HAS A VERY STRONG PERSONALITY AND VERY STRONG OPINIONS, SO FOR ME TO PUSH HER ON THINGS… YOU CAN IMAGINE THE FIREWORKS! WHAT’S FUNNY IS THAT WE’LL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING HEATED, AND WE JUST LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE RECOGNIZE THIS WHOLE THING WE’RE DOING. WE CAN KIND OF LAUGH, LIKE, “WE KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING” AND WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. IT’S GREAT WHEN WE HAVE THOSE MOMENTS. BUT IT’S DELICATE. . I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT YOU HAD BEEN MARRIED TO YOUR WIFE FOR 20 YEARS EVEN THOUGH BEFORE THAT YOU MAINLY DATED MEN. USUALLY IT HAPPENS THE OPPOSITE WAY AROUND. I DON’T KNOW… I’VE ALWAYS BEEN REALLY OPEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT’S VERY EASY FOR SOMEONE TO SAY, “I USED TO SEE HIM IN SEX CLUBS IN THE ’80S AND NOW HE PRETENDS HE’S STRAIGHT?” SO THE IDEA OF PRETENDING I’M STRAIGHT IS RIDICULOUS. I NEED TO GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I LOVE THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE BAD ROLE MODELS AND GOOD ROLE MODELS. PRESUMABLY, I WOULD BE A BAD ROLE MODEL BUT I THINK FOR SOMEONE…. WHY WOULD YOU BE A BAD ROLE MODEL? I DON’T THINK SO. I THINK MY FATHER DOES. TALK TO MY FATHER! (LAUGHS) ANYWAY, I THINK THE IDEA OF ME TELLING ANYBODY A MESSAGE IS RIDICULOUS, BUT IF ANYONE IS PAYING ATTENTION, I’M LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. YOU CAN OPEN YOUR HEART TO LOVE ANYBODY. YOU CAN BE AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU THINK. THERE ARE NO RULES. YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE JUST GAY. YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE JUST STRAIGHT. OPEN YOUR MIND! YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BE GAY WITH MOST PEOPLE, BUT MAYBE THERE’S ONE PERSON WHERE IT WOULD WORK. SO, IT’S NOT A BIG WIDE SWEEPING GENERAL RULE… IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT SEX. IT’S ALL OF THAT WHOLE COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT MAKE IT WORK. . WHAT ROLE DOES MICHELE PLAY IN YOUR WORK? SHE IS PART OF THE SPIRIT. I THINK PEOPLE ASSUME THAT SHE IS MAYBE THE PIERRE BERGE – IF WE’RE THINKING IN LEGENDARY YVES SAINT LAURENT TERMS – BUT I THINK MAYBE SHE’S MORE OF THE CATHERINE DENEUVE CHARACTER OF THAT LEGEND. SHE HAS GREAT INSPIRATION AND GREAT VISION. IT’S NOT LIKE SHE’S IN THE OFFICE EVERY DAY ON THE COMPUTER, SHE’S OUT IN THE WORLD, RESEARCHING, AND BRINGING ME THINGS BACK. IT’S ALMOST LIKE AN EPHEMERAL ROLE. IT CAN BE SO HARD TO DEFINE. . LIKE A MUSE? MUSES… THAT WORD IS LIKE A “FAG HAG.” I ALWAYS INTRODUCE HER AS MY BETTER HALF BECAUSE I THINK THAT’S SUCH A GREAT WAY OF PUTTING IT. I DON’T REALLY KNOW WHERE ONE OF US ENDS AND THE OTHER BEGINS. IT’S MORE PROFOUND THAN A BUSINESS PARTNER. WE WOULD BE HAVING A BEAUTIFULLY AESTHETIC LIFE WHETHER THIS WAS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT, IT’S JUST THAT WE’VE SOMEHOW MADE IT PUBLIC AND SOLD IT AND SO PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IT. BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT ANYWAY. SHE’S A GREAT PERSON TO BE POOR WITH BECAUSE WE’VE BEEN POOR TOGETHER! WE COULD LIVE IN A CAR TOGETHER AND IT WOULD BE REALLY FUN. BUT MICHELE DOESN’T SEE A COLLECTION UNTIL THAT DAY. . WHY NOT? IF MICHELE’S LOOKED AT SOMETHING AND FROWNED, IF SHE DIDN’T RESPOND THE WAY I WANTED, IT WOULD TOTALLY F CK ME UP. I CAN’T! I CAN’T ENGAGE HER. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE: I HAVE TO DECIDE. YOU WANT TO ENGAGE SOMEBODY THAT YOU’RE SO INTIMATE WITH, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP THEM AT A DISTANCE AT THE SAME TIME. IT’S AN ODD LITTLE BALANCE. THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME RELATIONSHIPS THAT THRIVE ON DISCUSSION AND A LOT MORE COLLABORATION, AND I WISH I COULD, BUT I’VE LEARNED THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO, I CAN’T. IT’S LIKE… I CAN’T LEARN FRENCH. YOU JUST CAN’T FORCE YOURSELF. FOR EVERYBODY’S BENEFIT I BETTER JUST DO MY JOB QUIETLY IN A LITTLE CORNER LIKE I DO. . I GUESS EVERYBODY HAS TO FIGURE OUT THEIR OWN BALANCE. THERE’S NOT REALLY A FORMULA FOR THESE KINDS OF THINGS. RELATIONSHIPS ARE COMPROMISES. SHE GRAVITATED TOWARDS THE FUR WHEN WE FIRST MOVED TO PARIS AND THEN WHEN WE STARTED DOING THE FURNITURE, COORDINATING THE ARTISANS TO DO THE FURNITURE, AND SHE TURNED THAT INTO THIS BIG THING. BETWEEN THE FUR AND FURNITURE, GETTING ALL THAT STUFF DONE, IT’S THIS WHOLE WORLD THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE ON MY OWN. IN THIS HOUSE, I HAVE A BATHROOM THAT IS PERFECT, THAT IS A REFUGE. I HAVE A MARBLE TOILET, I HAVE THIS WHOLE AREA THAT IS PERFECT THE WAY THAT I WANT IT. I HAVE MY OFFICE THE WAY I WANT IT; EVERYTHING IS RESOLVED. EVERYTHING ELSE, I DON’T CARE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS FINE BY ME. IT’S A TREMENDOUS RELEASE. I CAN’T CONTROL EVERYTHING. . BUT WITH YOUR DESIGN PROCESS, YOU CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? I JUST WORK FROM IMAGES OF THINGS ON A MANNEQUIN AND I’M LOOKING AT PROPORTIONS AND THEN I PRINT THEM OUT AND CUT THEM UP AND RE-PROPORTION THEM AND ADD LINES. THE INITIAL DESIGN PROCESS IS THAT. . YOU DON’T SKETCH? SKETCHES ARE PRETTY, BUT THEY’RE TOO UNREALISTIC. I DON’T THINK I EVER REALLY SKETCHED. IT ISN’T MY THING. ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE THERE’S JUST SOMETHING TOO CLICHÉ ABOUT FASHION SKETCHING. I WENT TO ART SCHOOL TO BE A PAINTER, SO I HAVE THIS STANDARD IMAGE THAT I THINK IS THE STANDARD OF ART AND I THINK A FASHION SKETCH WOULD BE TOO SUPERFICIAL. AND CHEAP. IT JUST SEEMS CORNY. IT’S NOT A NECESSARY STEP. IT’S JUST LIKE THIS FANTASY. IT’S LIKE COLLAGES. I HAVE THIS THING AGAINST MAKING COLLAGES OF INSPIRATIONS AND STUFF. . WHY? JUST GET TO THE POINT! IT’S JUST AN UNNECESSARY STEP THAT IS NOT REALLY TRUE. IT’S JUST SUPERFICIAL, IT’S NOT TECHNICAL. IT’S JUST KIND OF MASTURBATION. IT’S JUST JACKING OFF. GET A STEP CLOSER TO ACTUALLY REALIZING IT INSTEAD OF HAVING SOME KIND OF FANTASY ABOUT IT. JUST DO IT INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT IT SO MUCH. I LOOK AT MY OWN WORK AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST TRUE EXPRESSION AND I THINK, “HOW DO I GO A STEP BEYOND THAT?” I GUESS THAT’S MY PROCESS. BUT… ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT I SAY ABOUT PROCESS, YOU KNOW I’M A FRAUD, RIGHT? I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE F CK I’M DOING! I CAN TELL YOU ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT HOW I DO IT, BUT I JUST DON’T KNOW. . YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU FOLLOW THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON’T HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE. I REALLY LEARNED NOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE. THE OTHER THING I’VE LEARNED RECENTLY IS NOT TO LOOK AT SALES REPORTS. I USED TO, BUT IF I HAD LISTENED TO SALES REPORTS AT THE BEGINNING, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP ON THINGS THAT ARE SOME OF OUR BIGGEST SUCCESSES NOW, LIKE SHOES. SO SALES REPORTS ARE NOT THE ANSWER. THE OTHER THING IS I REALLY DON’T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING I DON’T WANT TO. AND I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF OF THIS SOMETIMES. THIS ISN’T A JOB, IT’S NOT LIKE I’M GOING TO LOSE MY JOB IF I DON’T GET THE RESULTS I WANT. . I GUESS YOU’RE OVER THAT HUMP BY NOW. THERE’S NO BOSS TO ANSWER TO! . I’M SURE YOU HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY BIG CONGLOMERATES TO BE PART OF THEIR COMPANY… YEAH, BUT I NEVER HAD THAT MUCH TO LOSE, SO IT WAS NEVER A RISK TO STAY ON MY OWN. THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, “IF I DO THIS, I COULD RETIRE TOMORROW.” BUT I DON’T WANT TO RETIRE! IT’S TEMPTING, YOU KNOW. YOU’RE OFFERED A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU’RE THINKING, “MAYBE I’M NEVER GOING TO GET OFFERED THIS MUCH AGAIN.” IT’S HARD. “AM I GOING TO REGRET THIS LATER?” BUT BEING OFFERED THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY IS A SURPRISE, I NEVER EXPECTED IT, SO IF I DON’T TAKE IT NOW, IT’S NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY LIFE EITHER. ANY TIME ANYBODY WANTS 51% OF YOUR COMPANY…. THEY HAVE A REASON FOR IT. EXACTLY, THERE’S A REASON FOR THAT ONE PERCENT. THE WHOLE GAME OF 51%, IT’S SO OMINOUS. THAT ONE PERCENT. I’D RATHER THEY ASK FOR 80% AND GIVE ME MORE MONEY! (LAUGHS) BUT I HAVE FANTASTIC PARTNERS. I HAVE A CEO AND A SALES DIRECTOR WHO ARE SO PROTECTIVE, WHO HAVE EVEN MORE INTEGRITY THAN I DO. I’M A WHORE! BUYERS HAVE COME TO ME AND I’VE SAID, “OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GREAT!” AND THEN MY CEO AND MY SALES DIRECTOR CALL ME DOWN AND SAY, “YOU KNOW, IF YOU DO THIS, IT’LL BURN US OUT TOO FAST. YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT.” THEY’RE NOT AFRAID OF STICKING TO OUR GUNS AND HAVING A VERY REFINED, CONFIDENT APPROACH. I’M INCREDIBLY LUCKY BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT IT TAKES. . YOU NEED PEOPLE THAT PROTECT YOU. NOT ONLY PROTECT, BUT DEVELOP. IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THIS KIND OF THING ALONE. THERE’S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT COULD BE DESIGNERS, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GREAT IDEAS, BUT IT’S THE EXECUTION. IT’S EASY TO HAVE INSPIRATION AND HAVE A VISION AND AN AESTHETIC, BUT IF YOU DON’T HAVE THE EXECUTION AND YOU DON’T GET IT OUT THERE PROPERLY AND ON TIME, IT DOESN’T MATTER. IT’LL SINK. I REALLY DON’T OVERESTIMATE MY ROLE IN THIS. GETTING IT OUT THERE, AND ON TIME, THAT’S KEY. I’M VERY LUCKY ABOUT THAT. AND I GET TO TAKE ALL THE CREDIT. .

FOR THE UNINITIATED THE LATTER ARE THE SEVEN-LEAGUE BOOTS OF HIGH-TOPS: TALL AND IMMENSE OF TONGUE, THEY REACH TO MID CALF. THE EFFECT IS OF SPORTSWEAR PUSHED TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS HEROIC: GLADIATORIAL. THE DESIGNER IS LOOKING MORE BRONZED AND BUFF EVEN THAN IS USUAL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE LOCATION IS PARIS AND IT’S LATE NOVEMBER. HE HAS JUST RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO DUBAI WHERE HE ATTENDED AN ART FAIR FEATURING HIS FURNITURE WITH MICHÈLE LAMY, HIS WIFE AND CREATIVE COLLABORATOR OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS, AND THE TWO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO SOAK UP A SPOT OF WINTER SUN WHILE THEY WERE THERE. “THERE’S ALWAYS AN EXCUSE TO GO SOMEWHERE WITH THE FURNITURE – IT’S ALWAYS OUT DOING SOMETHING,” OWENS SAYS. THE PIECES IN QUESTION – MONOLITHIC, IN AGED METALS AND WOODS UPHOLSTERED IN ALL THE SHADES OF GREY – HAVE INDEED TRAVELLED TO FRIEZE IN LONDON, MAASTRICHT IN HOLLAND AND ARE SOON OFF TO ART BASEL, MIAMI. “BUT DUBAI HAS BECOME KIND OF OUR SUN PLACE. IT’S PARADISE, WARM AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE WATER IS SO CLEAR. WE’VE BEEN TO MARRAKECH, WE’VE BEEN TO TANGIER, WE’VE SEEN WHERE IT’S CRUMBLING, WHERE THE RICH EUROPEANS AND AMERICANS COME IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT, AND WE’RE RICH. DUBAI IS DIFFERENT. WE’RE POOR IN DUBAI. AND THERE’S SOMETHING EERIE ABOUT IT. YOU’RE ON THIS PRISTINE BEACH, WHICH IS SO ARTIFICIAL. THEY’RE BUILDING LIKE CRAZY BUT HALF THE SPACES ARE EMPTY. THERE’S A FUTURISTIC AIRPORT AND INSIDE THERE ARE PEOPLE SITTING ON THE FLOOR IN ROBES. IT’S LIKE A ROCKET SHIP THAT’S TAKEN OFF AND RUN OUT OF CONTROL. IT’S LIKE STAR WARS – ANCIENT AND FUTURISTIC AT THE SAME TIME. AND THEN EVERYTHING HAS GOLD SLAPPED ON IT. FOR US, WHAT COULD BE WEIRDER?” OWENS HAS LONG BEEN IRRESISTIBLY DRAWN TO THE WEIRD – IT’S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT “FREAK” IS HIS ULTIMATE TERM OF ENDEARMENT – AND TO A PLACE THAT OCCUPIES BOTH THE ANCIENT AND THE MODERN FOR THAT MATTER. “YEAH, I GET CALLED GOTH A LOT WHICH MADE ME A LITTLE NERVOUS TO BEGIN WITH,” HE MUSES. HE HAS AN EXAGGERATED LA LILT THAT MIGHT NOT UNREASONABLY BE DESCRIBED AS SOOTHING, AND WHICH BELIES THE PURPOSEFULLY PROVOCATIVE IF PREDOMINANTLY PLAYFUL NATURE OF MUCH THAT HE SAYS. HE’S BEEN LIVING AND WORKING IN PARIS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE BUT SPEAKS NO FRENCH, HIS WIFE’S MOTHER TONGUE. “I’M MARRIED TO THIS FRENCHWOMAN WHO LAUGHS AT ME WHEN I TRY TO.” IN FACT, IF ANYTHING HIS ACCENT HAS BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED SINCE HE MOVED TO EUROPE “BECAUSE I DON’T EVER WANT TO SOUND LIKE MADONNA”, WHICH IS FAIR ENOUGH. “GOTH IS A LITTLE MARGINAL, A LITTLE ADOLESCENT,” HE CONTINUES, “AND I WOULDN’T HAVE LASTED AS LONG AS I HAVE DONE IF IT WAS PURELY THAT.” GIVEN THAT HIS COMPANY IS TODAY ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH IN THE REGION OF $100 MILLION, THAT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE. “BUT I WILL STILL FOREVER BE REFERRED TO AS THE GOTH GUY. WHICH IS FINE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FASHION CALENDAR I GUESS I AM THAT MORE THAN MOST. I GET IT. IT’S OKAY. AND THERE IS THAT SIDE. THERE IS A KERNEL OF TRUTH THERE. GOTH WAS ALWAYS ABOUT KIDS WHO DIDN’T FIT IN AND THAT’S PROBABLY BEEN PART OF THE APPEAL OF WHAT I DO. WHAT I DO IS PERHAPS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON’T FEEL THAT THEY FIT INTO THE WHOLE FASHION THING. IT’S LIKE, ‘WELCOME TO MY ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE’. AND THAT’S WHY THE SHOW THAT I DID MADE SENSE FOR A LABEL LIKE MINE. IT WAS ABOUT NOT FITTING IN THE WAY THAT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO FIT IN. IT WAS A CELEBRATION OF THAT.” OWENS’S SPRING/SUMMER 2014 PRESENTATION WAS A STANDOUT EVEN BY HIS OWN EXTREME STANDARDS. SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT IT RENDERED THE TRADITIONAL RUNWAY SHOW BANAL BY COMPARISON. FOR MONTHS, THE DESIGNER SEARCHED AMERICA AND CAST STEP DANCERS FROM FOUR DIFFERENT TROUPES – WASHINGTON DIVAS, SOUL STEPPERS, MOMENTUMS, ZETAS – IN PLACE OF PROFESSIONAL MODELS. THE SHOW WAS THEN CHOREOGRAPHED BY LAURETTA MALLOY NOBLE AND HER DAUGHTER LEEANET, ADDING ELEMENTS OF MORE PURELY AFRICAN DANCE. “STEP DANCING HAS SUCH STYLE, IT’S SO CHIC ON SO MANY LEVELS. IT HAS SOUL, AND THAT IS A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE. THERE ISN’T A DAY THAT GOES BY WHEN I DON’T LISTEN TO ARETHA OR TO LABELLE,” OWENS SAYS. IT WOULD BE FOOLHARDY NOT TO BELIEVE HIM. HE IS NOTHING IF NOT A CREATURE OF HABIT WITH A ROUTINE SO RIGID THAT HE HIMSELF ADMITS IT IS “MANIACAL, FASCISTIC, OTHERWISE I WOULD NEVER GET EVERYTHING DONE”. HE RECENTLY OUTLINED A TYPICAL 24 HOURS FOR BRITISH HARPER’S BAZAAR: GRANOLA MID-MORNING, THE GYM AT LUNCHTIME, A POWER NAP LATE AFTERNOON, DINNER WITH HIS WIFE AT 9PM PRECISELY EVERY NIGHT, ALMOST INVARIABLY A CHEESEBURGER AND CHOCOLATE CAKE AT THE BRASSERIE BOURBON ON THE CORNER. “I DON’T OBSERVE WEEKENDS OR HOLIDAYS,” HE WROTE. WITH ITS ROOTS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE, STEPPING, A COLLECTION OF RHYTHMS USING BOTH HANDS AND FEET, ROSE TO PROMINENCE IN THE 60S AND 70S WHEN BLACK MEN AND WOMEN WERE INTEGRATED INTO UNIVERSITIES IN THE US FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IS HARDLY COMPLACENT FASHION FODDER, NOT LEAST BECAUSE DECIDING ON THIS APPROACH AUTOMATICALLY ENTAILED TURNING THE USUAL – AND HEAVILY SCRUTINISED – RATIO OF BLACK TO WHITE MODELS ON ITS HEAD. IF EVER PROOF WERE NEEDED THAT OWENS’S AMBITIONS ARE ON A GRAND SCALE – AND AT THE SAME TIME A VERY HUMAN ONE – THEN IT CAME HERE. “WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RACE AT SOME POINT. AND HOW DOES SOMEONE LIKE ME DO THAT WITHOUT SOUNDING COMPLETELY CONDESCENDING?” HE WONDERS. “I DON’T KNOW; IT’S A DELICATE THING. STEPPING HAD A RAP ELEMENT TO IT EVEN BEFORE RAP WAS INVENTED.” HIP-HOP CULTURE PERMEATES HIS AESTHETIC ALSO – HENCE THOSE DROPPED CROTCHES AND HIGH-TOPS. “IT’S PART OF THAT THREAD AND, TO ME, THAT THREAD IS A RESPONSE TO ADVERSITY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CHAIN AT THE END OF THE SHOW WAS ORIGINALLY A LINE THE BLACK STUDENTS WOULD FORM TO GET THROUGH WHITE RIOTERS. IT’S PART OF THE HISTORY OF EMPOWERMENT.” THE EFFECT OF THIS, THE FINALE, WAS ESPECIALLY IMPACTFUL – BOTH JOYFUL AND FEROCIOUS IN EQUAL PARTS. “THE DANCERS WERE PRESSED UP SO TIGHTLY AGAINST EACH OTHER, YOU COULDN’T GET CLOSER TO ANOTHER PERSON UNLESS YOU WERE F CKING THEM,” IS HOW OWENS PUTS IT. “THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MOVING ABOUT THAT, ABOUT THAT PRIMAL INSTINCT TO LINK UP, TO BECOME PART OF HUMANITY, TO BECOME ONE IN RESPONSE TO CONFLICT OR AGGRESSION… TO ME THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT THING TO HONOUR. I MEAN, WHO DOESN’T IDENTIFY WITH THAT? I DIDN’T CREATE IT. IT’S PART OF WHAT THEY DO. I DIDN’T REALLY INTERFERE VERY MUCH AT ALL.” HE DID, HOWEVER, INTRODUCE A BYETONE ELECTRONIC SOUNDTRACK TO THE MIX THAT ONLY ADDED TO THE UNORTHODOX AND ALL-ENCOMPASSING ENERGY OF IT. IT ALMOST GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT OWENS WAS AWARE HE WAS TREADING ON POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS GROUND. “I KNEW THAT, AT THE FIRST LEVEL DOING THE SHOW IN THAT WAY WAS COOL AND THAT AT THE SECOND LEVEL IT WAS NOT SOMETHING I’M SUPPOSED TO MESS WITH,” HE SAYS. “IF I HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT WAS POLITICALLY CORRECT, I WOULD HAVE LEFT IT ALONE. I WASN’T PRESENTING BLACK WOMEN AS NAOMI CAMPBELL. THEY WEREN’T GLAMAZONS. I WAS PRESENTING THEM AS TOUGH AND STRONG. THEY WEREN’T WEARING BEAUTIFUL MAKE-UP. THEY WEREN’T WEARING PRETTY THINGS. THEY WERE WEARING ATHLETIC CLOTHES, EVEN AGGRESSIVE ONES. YOU KNOW MY THING ABOUT MINISKIRTS. I HATE MINISKIRTS, THAT THING WHERE YOU HAVE TO CROSS YOUR LEGS WHEREVER YOU ARE WHEN YOU WEAR THEM. YOU’RE IN THIS SUPER-HIGH MINISKIRT AND HIGH, HIGH HEELS AND YOU’RE TOTTERING ALONG ON COBBLESTONES IN PARIS… I MEAN, WHY NOT JUST PUT RESTRAINTS ON THE GIRLS AND THEN BLINDFOLD THEM?” AND SO OWENS’S SIGNATURE DRAPING, WRAPPING AND FOLDING WAS SLASHED, SPLICED AND LACED TO ALLOW MAXIMUM MOVEMENT. THE COLLECTION WAS THIS TIME, AS ALWAYS, EMANCIPATED IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD BUT ALWAYS TOUGH, FUNCTIONAL AND FORCEFUL IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES NO ONE WOULD EVER WANT TO MESS WITH THE WEARER – UNLESS THE WEARER WANTED TO BE MESSED WITH, THAT IS. “I CAN SEE THAT THE SHOW WAS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY WAS LOOKING FOR,” THE MAN BEHIND IT CONCLUDES. “IT COULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS OFFENSIVE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS INSENSITIVE. OR IT COULD BE SO INSENSITIVE THAT IT WAS LIKE A BIG ‘F CK YOU’ TO EVERYTHING, LIKE, ‘WE’RE JUST DOING THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO’. AND THAT’S BASICALLY WHAT IT WAS. TO ME, THE DANCERS LOOKED SEXY, TOTALLY JUICY – WONDERFUL. I WASN’T SO NERVOUS ABOUT A NEGATIVE RESPONSE. I NEVER REALLY AM.” WE ARE TALKING IN OWENS’S FIVE-STOREY STUDIO AND HOME ON PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON, SITUATED IN THE SHADOW OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE. WHEN DIGNITARIES ARE VISITING IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR HIM TO LOOK OUT OF HIS WINDOW AND SEE THEM IN THE GARDEN. HIS OWN RESIDENCE WAS ONCE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY. FRANÇOIS MITTERRAND HAD AN OFFICE HERE. “IT WAS HIDEOUS,” OWENS SAYS OF THE WARREN OF BUREAUCRATIC CUBICLES IT COMPRISED WHEN HE FIRST SAW IT. “WHEN WE BOUGHT IT, IT WAS ALL WALLPAPERED AND CARPETED WITH LOWERED CEILINGS AND ACOUSTIC TILES. I DON’T KNOW HOW PEOPLE WORKED HERE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS SMALL, TIGHT AND OPPRESSED.” THE SAME COULD NEVER BE SAID OF THE MAGNIFICENT, BARE-BONED, PREDOMINANTLY NINETEENTH-CENTURY INTERIOR THAT IT IS TODAY. WIRES ARE LEFT EXPOSED THROUGHOUT, FLOORS ARE RAW CONCRETE BUT THERE’S A SABLE THROWN ACROSS A DAY BED AS IF IT WERE A RAG HERE, AN INSTALLATION BY BARRY X BALL SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING, OR A HUMAN SKULL ON A VAST STONE-COLOURED TABLE THERE. OWENS HAS IN THE PAST SPOKEN OF “THE LUXURY OF NOT CARING” AND THE PRECIOUS NATURE OF THE ARTEFACTS GATHERED UNDER THIS HISTORIC BUT STILL LARGELY UNFINISHED ROOF IS SURELY THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THAT. A WHISTLE-STOP TOUR REVEALS THE COUPLE’S SLEEPING QUARTERS DOMINATED BY A BED DESIGNED BY OWENS AND BASED ON THE ONE THEY SHARED BACK IN LOS ANGELES. IT COULD COMFORTABLY SLEEP AN ARMY. OWENS BUILT A LIMITED EDITION OF TWO OF THESE IN ALABASTER, AT WHICH POINT THEY WEIGHED A FULL TWO TONNES APIECE AND SOLD FOR $180,000. ONE LUCKY RECIPIENT WAS REPORTEDLY OBLIGED TO REINFORCE HIS FLOOR TO ACCOMMODATE HIS PURCHASE. THEN THERE’S HIS WIFE’S “HAMMAM”, CROWDED WITH LOTIONS AND POTIONS AND OWENS’S OWN BATHROOM, WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING RENOVATED BUT WILL BE MORE BRUTAL AS BEFITS THE NATURE OF THE MAN WHO WILL PERFORM HIS ABLUTIONS THEREIN. “I’LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. IT’S A MARBLE TOILET,” OWENS SAYS COMING AS CLOSE AS HE EVER MIGHT TO A CERTAIN SENSE OF PRIDE. THEN: “I KNOW IT SOUNDS GRAND BUT IT’S JUST AN EXPERIMENT REALLY.” ON A SEPARATE FLOOR, ARE THE WORKROOMS FOR THE RICK OWENS FUR COLLECTION – IT’S CALLED HUN, WHICH IS OWENS’S NOT QUITE BENIGN NICKNAME FOR LAMY – AND IS DESIGNED BY HIM AND REALISED BY HER. THE FURNITURE IS CONCEIVED HERE TOO AND IS ALSO PRINCIPALLY LAMY’S DOMAIN. “I’M NOT REALLY ALLOWED IN HERE,” OWENS WHISPERS AS HE POKES HIS HEAD INTO THIS ROOM. “IT’S KIND OF LIKE A GYPSY TRYING TO ORGANISE A WAR WITH A NAZI,” IS HOW HE DESCRIBED THEIR PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP WHEN WE FIRST MET. “MICHÈLE’S WORLD IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN MINE,” HE SAYS NOW. “HER CHAOS IS FULL OF WARMTH AND MY ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE MUCH MORE RIGID AND COLD WITHOUT HER. THE FURNITURE WAS BORN BECAUSE WE NEEDED THINGS FOR THE HOUSE AND IF WE WEREN’T ABLE TO BUY FANTASTIC JEAN-MICHEL FRANK CHAIRS, SAY, THEN WE THOUGHT, ‘LET’S JUST MAKE IT OURSELVES.’” THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN SO DOING CALLS FOR PATIENCE THAT, OWENS SAYS, IS NOT HIS GREATEST STRENGTH. THE MASTER CRAFTSMEN WHO PRODUCE THIS WORK ARE RARE AND COLLABORATING WITH THEM IS NECESSARILY COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING. “THE DEALINGS MICHÈLE HAS WITH THESE PEOPLE ARE MAGICAL,” SAYS OWENS. “SHE CAJOLES THEM, PUSHES THEM TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR HER. SHE BEWITCHES THEM, I SWEAR TO YOU SHE DOES. I’VE GONE WITH HER A COUPLE OF TIMES AND SHE’S THERE WITH ALL THE BRACELETS ON, AND THE FURS, AND SHE’S WALKING IN AND ASHING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THESE GUYS ARE JUST ENTRANCED BY HER.” HE PAUSES FOR THOUGHT. “MICHÈLE IS LIKE CHRISTMAS.” OWENS WAS BORN IN PORTERVILLE, AN AGRICULTURAL TOWN NOT FAR FROM LOS ANGELES, IN 1961. AN ONLY CHILD, HIS FATHER IS A RETIRED SOCIAL WORKER, HIS MOTHER FORMERLY A SCHOOLTEACHER AND AN EXPERT SEAMSTRESS WHO TOOK GREAT PAINS TO DRESS HER SON IN HAND-CRAFTED TAILORING WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. OWENS ATTENDED THE LOCAL CATHOLIC SCHOOL WHERE, AS “A VERY SHELTERED, VERY THIN-SKINNED, SUPER-SENSITIVE LITTLE BOY, IT WAS HARD, IT WAS VERY HARD. I MEAN, THE OTHER KIDS WERE VICIOUS, LIKE ANIMALS. IT STILL MAKES ME ANGRY THINKING OF THIS NICE LITTLE KID GOING INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT. I WAS A TOTAL SISSY, VERY QUIET, VERY PASSIVE, VERY SCARED”. HE ONCE TOLD ME CHEERFULLY: “I COULD TOTALLY HAVE GONE COLUMBINE THERE.” ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS CLASSMATES WERE ONLY EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT HIS FATHER REFUSED TO ALLOW A TELEVISION INTO THE HOUSE UNTIL HIS SON WAS 16. UP TILL THEN HE LISTENED TO CLASSICAL MUSIC – WAGNER, MAHLER, BOTH OF WHICH ARE STILL FAVOURITES – AND TO READ PROLIFICALLY AND PRECOCIOUSLY. AFTER SCHOOL, OWENS WENT TO THE OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN IN LA BUT DROPPED OUT AFTER TWO YEARS. HE CLAIMS NOT TO HAVE HAD THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA TO SURVIVE IN SUCH A MILIEU, ALTHOUGH THAT SEEMS DOUBTFUL. INSTEAD, HE ENDED UP STUDYING PATTERN CUTTING AT LOS ANGELES TRADE-TECHNICAL COLLEGE “WITH ALL THESE KOREAN LADIES – NOT GLAMOROUS”, AND LATER WORKED FOR “KNOCK-OFF COMPANIES IN LA. I KNOCKED OFF PATTERNS FOR YEARS”. IN 1994, HE STARTED HIS OWN COMPANY, IN THE FIRST PLACE MAKING CLOTHES FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS. HE WAS BY THIS POINT AN INTEGRAL PART OF LA SUBCULTURE AND WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES TO MATCH. STILL, HE MADE A WASHED LEATHER JACKET WITH ULTRA-LONG, SKINNY SLEEVES, A BIASCUT SKIRT WITH RAW EDGES AND A LONG ASYMMETRIC TRAIN, AND NARROW, FINE JERSEY T-SHIRTS IN SLUDGY SHADES. LAMY, WHO AT THAT POINT OWNED AND FRONTED CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, A CELEBRATED NIGHTSPOT, WORE HIS CLOTHES. COURTNEY LOVE WAS ALSO AN EARLY ADOPTER. OWENS NAMED THE LOOK “GLUNGE” – A HYBRID OF GLAMOUR AND GRUNGE. HE MADE HIS CLOTHES AT HOME AND THEN DROVE AROUND SELLING THEM HIMSELF TO CHARLES GALLAY AND TOMMY PERSE IN LA, JOYCE MARR IN HONG KONG, MARIA LUISA IN PARIS, AND JOAN BURSTEIN IN LONDON. SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE COLLECTION GREW. LAMY, MEANWHILE, BOUGHT A SECOND CAFÉ AND THE TWO MOVED IN TOGETHER IN A DRUG-FUELLED, DECADENT HAZE INSPIRED, OWENS SAID IN THE NEW YORKER IN 2008, BY BAUDELAIRE, TENNESSEE WILLIAMS AND “JUST THE WHOLE IDEA OF EXCESS AND THE PHRASE ‘A CANDLE THAT BURNS AT BOTH ENDS MIGHT BURN SHORTER, BUT IT BURNS BRIGHTER’”. “MY BUSINESS PLAN WAS TO BE CHARLES JAMES,” HE TOLD ME NOT LONG AFTER. “I WAS GOING TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND LIVE IN GLAMOROUS SQUALOR ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AND DIE THE HERO FOR HAVING STUCK TO MY VISION AND NOT COMPROMISED.” FORTUNE FAVOURS THE BRAVE AND WHEN IN 2001 (OWENS AND LAMY BY THEN CLEAN AND SERENE), US VOGUE FEATURED KATE MOSS IN ONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED JACKETS, THE DESIGNER CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF ANNA WINTOUR, WHO SPONSORED HIS FIRST SHOW IN NEW YORK. OWENS HAD BACKING COURTESY OF ITALIAN SALES AGENCY EBA, DISTRIBUTORS OF EUROPEAN DESIGNERS INCLUDING OLIVIER THEYSKENS AND ANN DEMEULEMEESTER. THAT COMPANY’S PRESIDENT LUCA RUGGERI AND HIS SISTER-IN-LAW ELSA LANZO ARE NOW OWENS’S COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR AND “GLAMOROUS” CEO RESPECTIVELY. THAT SAME YEAR HE WAS APPOINTED CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF PARISIAN FUR HOUSE, REVILLON, AND OWENS, LAMY AND THEIR INCREASINGLY SUCCESSFUL BUT STILL COMPARATIVELY SMALL COMPANY MOVED TO PARIS. WHILE RICK OWENS HAD LONG BEEN THE LABEL OF CHOICE FOR A HIGHLY SPECIFIC, DISCERNING AND VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER – A WOMAN, OR INDEED MAN, WHO ENJOYED THE PECULIARLY LUXURIOUS NATURE OF THE MOST HIGH-END FABRICS HANDLED WITH A NONCHALANCE THAT STUDIOUSLY UNDERMINED THEIR EXPENSE – WHO ENSURED GROWTH, THE DESIGNER HIMSELF SAYS THAT, UNTIL RELATIVELY RECENTLY, HE HAS NEVER QUITE FELT MASTER OF HIS CRAFT AND OF THE PARIS FASHION SHOW CIRCUIT IN PARTICULAR. “WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE I FELT I HAD TO START PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN FASHION AND TO MOVE THINGS TO A DIFFERENT PLACE,” HE SAYS. “I WAS MUCH MORE SELFCONSCIOUS AND STARTED PERFORMING A BIT. I THOUGHT, ‘I GUESS I NEED HELP’ AND HIRED THIS BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE CUTE AND CREATIVE. I THOUGHT, ‘A SMART PERSON KNOWS HOW TO CULTIVATE IDEAS, HOW TO DRAW THINGS OUT OF A TEAM, HOW TO GET THE BEST OUT OF EVERYONE’. I THOUGHT, ‘THEY’RE CLEVER AND IF THEY LIKE IT, I’M SURE OTHER PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT TOO’. I DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO DO IT AT ALL. I WAS TRYING TO BE WORLD STAGE AND IT JUST MADE ME FEEL LIKE A SOCIAL CLIMBER. SO THEN I KNEW I JUST HAD TO ELIMINATE THAT. I REALISED THAT I’M THE ONE WITH THE IDEAS AND WHAT I ACTUALLY NEED IS FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO EXECUTE THEM FOR ME.” OWENS NOW HAS A SKELETON CREATIVE TEAM – ONE PATTERN CUTTER FOR WOMENSWEAR, ONE FOR MENSWEAR, TWO PEOPLE MAKING SHOES, ANOTHER BAGS – AND HE WORKS ON COLLECTIONS IN SPLENDID ISOLATION IN THE ITALIAN FACTORIES OUTSIDE BOLOGNA WHERE HIS CLOTHES ARE MADE AND WHERE HE SPENDS WEEKENDS ALONE RE-WORKING OLD PATTERNS, ALWAYS STARTING WITH THOSE AND DEVELOPING THE NEW SEASON’S DESIGNS FROM THERE. “I DON’T FEEL THAT HORRIBLE PRESSURE THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT,” HE SAYS, “BUT I DON’T WORK FOR A BIG COMPANY THAT I HAVE TO ANSWER TO EITHER. I MEAN, I DON’T KNOW HOW THOSE PEOPLE DO IT. IF I HAD TO EXPLAIN MYSELF EVERY DAY IT WOULD KILL ME. I DON’T REALLY TALK ABOUT MY COLLECTIONS WITH ANYONE. NO ONE IN THE COMPANY EVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE UNTIL A FEW DAYS BEFORE THEY ARE SHOWN. OF COURSE, IT IS A CONVERSATION BUT, ON A VERY INSTINCTIVE LEVEL, IT’S A CONVERSATION I’M HAVING WITH THE WORLD. I THINK THAT FOR EVERYBODY, THE MAIN THING IN LIFE IS TO BE LISTENED TO. TO BE LISTENED TO BY SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU, TO BE LISTENED TO BY A LOVER, TO BE LISTENED TO BY CHILDREN WHO YOU WANT TO TEACH. YOU WANT TO EXPRESS YOURSELF AND FOR PEOPLE TO RESPOND. AND I GET TO DO THAT. I’M IN THIS GREAT SITUATION. IT’S VERY SATISFYING.” TWO YEARS AGO, OWENS MOVED HIS SHOWROOM TO THE OTHER SIDE OF PARIS AND HERE, WITH HIS FIRST MEN’S PRE-COLLECTION ON DISPLAY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE THE EXTENT OF HIS FASHION EMPIRE, 80 PER CENT OF WHICH IS STILL OWNED BY HIM PERSONALLY, THE REMAINING 20 PER CENT BY RUGGERI AND LANZO BETWEEN THEM. THE POLISHED WOOD FLOORS AND ALUMINIUM FIXTURES AND FITTINGS ARE “A LITTLE SLICK FOR MY LIKING BUT IT WORKS”, OWENS SAYS. “I DID THIS TALK FOR A FASHION SCHOOL, IT WAS A SKYPE TALK AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS ASKED ME, MR OWENS, WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY? AND I GO, I’M THE OPPOSITE OF SUSTAINABILITY. IT’S ALL ABOUT SELLING MORE AND MORE CLOTHES THAT NOBODY NEEDS. POLLUTING MORE RIVERS WITH MY BLACK DYE. POISONING THE PLANET,” HE LAUGHS. “BUT I LIKE THESE CLOTHES. I LIKE HOW YOU COULD WEAR THEM TO DO THE GARDENING, TO DANCE, TO GO TO THE GYM OR TO THE OPERA. THEY’RE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS EXACTLY SO THAT MAKES THEM APPROPRIATE FOR EVERYTHING.” IN THE PAST 18 MONTHS, OWENS HAS PRODUCED AN ACCESSORIES LOOK BOOK PHOTOGRAPHED BY PAUL KOOIKER FEATURING FULSOME PALE NAKED WOMEN IN VARIOUS STIFFENED POSES – PRINCIPALLY PROSTRATE – WITH COVERED HEADS AND WITH THE PRODUCT LYING AROUND THEM AS IF MERELY INCIDENTAL. IT BLOWS EVERY TRACE OF THAT MEDIUM’S NORMALLY POLITE AND BLATANTLY COMMERCIAL PROTOCOL OUT OF THE WATER. “WASN’T THAT GREAT?” HE SAYS. HE THREW A PARTY AT THE BACKSTREET BAR, THE OLDEST FETISH CLUB IN EAST LONDON, HOSTED BY JAMES JEANETTE, TO CELEBRATE THE OPENING OF A POP UP SHOP FOR HIS SECONDARY LINE DRKSHDW LAST SEPTEMBER. “IT WAS SUPER FILTHY BUT IT WAS PERFECT,” HE REMEMBERS. “SO SWEET. I’VE ALWAYS LOVED A BIT OF SLEAZE. THAT USED TO BE OUR LIFE AND I MISS THAT. I ENJOY THE ROMANCE, THE POIGNANT ELEMENT OF THAT ATTRACTION TO SELF-DESTRUCTION AND DECAY, TO IMPERILLED BEAUTY. I MEAN, WHAT COULD BE MORE FASCINATING THAN SOME PRETTY YOUNG ACTRESS WITH A DRUG PROBLEM ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE? I LIKE IT WHEN YOU CUT THROUGH THE SHIT AND JUST SAY WHAT YOU WANT. LIFE REALLY IS ABOUT SEX AND DEATH AND EVERYBODY POOPS. NO MATTER HOW EXPENSIVE YOUR GUCCI OUTFIT IS, YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A DUMP SOME DAY.” HIS SPRING/ SUMMER MENSWEAR SHOW, MEANWHILE, WAS AS OUTRAGEOUS AS HIS WOMEN’S PRESENTATION WAS STIRRING, AND PRESIDED OVER BY ESTONIAN EUROVISION SONG CONTEST HOPEFULS FOR 2013, WINNY PUHH: “I MEAN, DRUMMERS REVOLVING ON A PLINTH, HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE THAT?” OWENS ASKS. “AND THEN YOU SLING SOME GUYS UP IN THE AIR. IT WAS JUST BEYOND WHAT YOU EXPECT AND IT WAS EXCESSIVE IN A PHYSICAL WAY. I FIRST CAME ACROSS THEM ON THIS WEIRD BLOG. WHAT CAN I SAY? THERE’S SOME SERIOUSLY SICK SHIT OUT THERE.” HOWEVER FAR OWENS MIGHT PUSH AT THE BOUNDARIES, HOWEVER, THERE IS ALWAYS A TENDERNESS AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING HE DOES AND THEREIN, PERHAPS, LIES THE KEY TO ITS APPEAL. “MY IDEA OF TRANSGRESSION IS ALWAYS AFFECTIONATE,” HE CONFIRMS. “PEOPLE CAN BE SO STRICT AND THERE ARE SO MANY RULES. IT’S FUN TO MAYBE JUST TEASE A BIT. THAT’S WHAT I’M DOING. IT’S NOT ANGER AT ALL. WHEN I DO A PICTURE OF ME PEEING INTO MY OWN MOUTH – I MEAN, COME ON, IT’S A LITTLE FUNNY, DON’T YOU THINK? YOU CAN’T THINK IT’S THAT SERIOUS. THE FACT THAT IT MAKES SOMEONE WHO’S CONSERVATIVE TURN WHITE, THAT’S WHAT I’M DOING IT FOR.” NOW MORE THAN ADEPT AT SIMPLY BEING HIMSELF AND TRUSTING HIS RAZOR-SHARP INSTINCTS, HE HAS INSPIRATION IMAGES ON HIS PHONE BUT EVEN THESE ARE MOSTLY OF HIS OWN WORK. THERE’S NOT AN ART BOOK OR MOOD BOARD – THE USUAL STAPLES OF THE DESIGN ATELIER – IN SIGHT. “I HATE MOOD BOARDS,” SAYS OWENS. “IN FACT, I CONDEMN MOOD BOARDS. THEY’RE JUST SO CORNY – MY INSPIRATIONS ARE PRIVATE.” THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT EXPANSIVE OR THAT HIS USE OF THEM IS ANY LESS REFINED, RUNNING THE GAMUT FROM THE EVERYDAY TO THE ETERNAL, FROM THE VISCERAL TO THE IVORY-TOWERED. WHEN PUSHED, OWENS CITES JUGENDSTIL, 30S ARCHITECTURE, ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS AND FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AS INFLUENTIAL. HE IS ALSO INDEBTED TO THE WORK OF CLAUDE MONTANA (“HE WAS LUNAR WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND I WOULD NEVER EVEN HAVE IMAGINED VISITING FRANCE. IT’S FUNNY HOW THINGS TURNED OUT”) AND THIERRY MUGLER, “THE EARLY, GREY, MILITARY STUFF. I REMEMBER SEEING THAT IN MY MOTHER’S MAGAZINES WHEN I WAS A CHILD. YOU DON’T SEE THEM THAT MUCH ANY MORE. “I USE BIBLICAL REFERENCES A LOT. I LIKE THE EGYPTIAN SLAVE SILHOUETTE. I LOVE MADAME GRÈS. AND WHEN I MIX THAT WITH SKATEBOARDER SHORTS AND A BIG BOMBER, IT CROSSES THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF HISTORY”. RICK OWENS IS EMBRACING BOTH THE FUTURISTIC AND THE ANCIENT, THEN. AS HE SAYS, “THAT IS SO BIG, IT IS BIGGER THAN WE ARE. IT’S LIKE WITH THE SHOWS. I WANT THE ELEMENTS TO BE BIGGER THAN THE ACTUAL STAGE. I WANT THE FOAM TO COME DOWN AND ACTUALLY COME INTO THE AUDIENCE, I WANT THE FIRE TO BE AS BIG AS POSSIBLE. IT’S ABOUT THE IDEA OF SEEING OURSELVES IN PERSPECTIVE AND THAT’S ALSO WHY I DO A LOT OF MONOCHROME IN MY CLOTHES. I LIKE SEEING A HEAD ON TOP OF A COLUMN OF COLOUR. IF THERE’S TOO MUCH FUSSINESS, IT’S JUST TOO ANAL AND IT’S NOT THINKING OF YOURSELF AS A PARTICIPANT IN A WIDER STORY. IT’S TAKING YOURSELF A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY. “WHEN I’M TALKING ABOUT SCALE AND ABOUT PUTTING THE THINGS THAT I DO INTO A MONUMENTAL EMPTY SPACE, IT’S BOTH TO ISOLATE THEM AND FRAME THEM, TO MAKE THEM MORE SPECIAL BUT ALSO TO SHOW THAT ALL OF US ARE VERY SMALL ELEMENTS OF SOMETHING VERY BIG”.

USUALLY, OWENS WOULD BE IN THE THROES OF PREPARATION FOR HIS OWN-LABEL SHOW ON THAT DATE, BUT THIS YEAR’S OSCARS WERE PUSHED BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF MARCH. MEANING THAT OWENS COULD WATCH THE ACTION LIVE, SHOULD HE SO CHOOSE. HE CHOSE NOT TO – ALTHOUGH HIS WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER, MICHÈLE LAMY, DID. OWENS YAWNS, BECAUSE HE SLEPT ON THE SOFA WHILE LAMY WATCHED THE EARLY-HOURS CEREMONY IN BED. “SHE’S MAD ABOUT THE OSCARS,” HE CONFESSED IN A CALIFORNIAN DRAWL THAT BETRAYS HIS BIRTHPLACE AND HIS FORMATIVE YEARS IN LOS ANGELES. OWENS NEVER MOVED TO NEW YORK, SO HIS ACCENT REMAINS WEST COAST LANGUID – PEPPERED WITH GNARLY BILL &amp; TED-ESQUE TURNS OF PHRASE, SUCH AS “LIKE” AND “YOU KNOW” – RATHER THAN EAST COAST STACCATO. HE HAS BEEN BASED IN PARIS SINCE 2003, BUT DOESN’T SPEAK FRENCH. THOSE ARE THE INCIDENTALS, BUT IDEOLOGICALLY IT FEELS ODD TO THINK OF OWENS AND THE OSCARS. DESPITE LIVING AND BUILDING HIS BUSINESS IN LOS ANGELES, THERE IS NO LESS-“STARRY” DESIGNER WORKING IN ALL OF FASHION THAN OWENS. IF HE DOES AN EVENING GOWN, IT’S LIKELY TO BE IN PILLED GREY CASHMERE WITH A TRAIN TRAILING IN THE MUD, OR IN MULTIPLE LAYERS OF CELLOPHANE THAT END UP RESEMBLING THE SHOWER CURTAIN FROM PSYCHO. AT THE SAME TIME, THE RICK OWENS DISTRESSED LEATHER JACKET – ASYMMETRIC, SUPER-SKINNY OF ARM AND FLUTTERING OF HEM – HAS BECOME THE GO-TO GARB FOR STARLETS, HARLOTS AND “ZOEBOTS” IN THE MINIMAL LA STRUT FROM STRETCH HUMMER TO STARBUCKS, DESPITE ITS LACK OF HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR. MAYBE THAT SHOULD BE LACK OF “CONVENTIONAL” HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR – BECAUSE, TO OWENS’S EYES, THERE IS GLAMOUR IN HIS SHROUD-LIKE SHAPES, HIS TULLES AND MULTIPLE-WASHED WOOLS AND SILKS, HIS CREASED AND CRUMPLED LAYERS. OWENS ISN’T ANTI-GLAMOUR, OR EVEN ANTI- FASHION, HE’S ANTI-CONVENTION. AND UNLIKE JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER CONTEMPORARY PURVEYOR OF STAR-SPANGLED EVENING FROCKS, OWENS IS A CALIFORNIAN COUTURIER THROUGH AND THROUGH. HE IS ALSO, TO BORROW THE PARLANCE OF THAT QUINTESSENTIALLY LOS ANGELEAN HEROINE CHER HOROWITZ, A TOTALLY IMPORTANT DESIGNER. ALEXANDER FURY: “HOW LONG DID YOU LIVE IN LA? WAS THAT WHERE YOU WERE BROUGHT UP?” RICK OWENS: “NO, I WAS JUST THERE IN MY WILD YEARS, THE PERIOD YOU BLOSSOM INTO YOURSELF – SO MY GLORY YEARS, I SUPPOSE. IN MY TWENTIES, BASICALLY. AND THAT’S WHERE I REALLY GOT STARTED AND THAT’S WHERE I REALLY KIND OF BECAME... THAT WAS KIND OF THE KERNEL OF EVERYTHING THAT I DO, I SUPPOSE. THAT’S WHEN I FIRST STARTED LEARNING TO DO WHAT I DO.” ALEXANDER FURY: “HAS IT INFLUENCED THE WAY YOU DESIGN?” RICK OWENS: “I MEAN, I LOOK AT THE 1930S WHEN I THINK OF WOMEN’S CLOTHES. THAT’S THE ERA THAT I LIKE, THAT BLACK- AND-WHITE, HOLLYWOOD, LANGUOROUS ERA. I THINK IT’S PARTLY THAT, AND IT’S PARTLY ME GROWING UP – THE THINGS THAT MADE THE MOST SENSE. EVERYTHING I DO THAT IS SHORTS AND T-SHIRTS IS SHORTS AND T-SHIRTS, THE SIMPLEST THINGS, AND THEN I JUST GO FROM THERE. LIKE, WHAT IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL, PRIMAL THING THAT YOU WOULD WEAR IN THE JUNGLE IF YOU LIVED THERE BY YOURSELF? AND THEN KIND OF ELABORATE FROM THERE. WITH MEN’S IT’S VERY MUCH ABOUT ICONIC MASCULINITY, THE THINGS THAT MAKE MEN HISTORICALLY LOOK THE MOST NOBLE.” ALEXANDER FURY: “WHICH IS TRUE OF A LOT OF YOUR WOMENSWEAR, TOO, ACTUALLY. BUT DOES YOUR APPROACH TO CLOTHING DIFFER ACCORDING TO GENDER?” RICK OWENS: “OH YEAH. WITH MEN... MEN HAVE A SMALLER MARGIN TO FLIRT. WITH WOMEN, THERE’S A BIGGER COMFORT LEVEL TO EXAGGERATE, TO BE COQUETTISH. I THINK, BOTTOM LINE, WHAT MEN ARE GOING FOR IS A SENSE OF PROPRIETY, MASCULINITY AND, ABOVE ALL, A KIND OF DIGNITY. WOMEN CAN AFFORD TO BE MORE PLAYFUL. I THINK, WITH MEN, IT’S HARD FOR THEM TO WANT TO APPEAR AS IF THEY ARE TRYING TO BE ALLURING – WITH WOMEN IT’S ACCEPTABLE. WITH MEN, TRYING TO LOOK ALLURING, IT’S PROBLEMATIC. DEFINITELY WITH WOMAN THERE IS A LOT OF LEEWAY TO BE EXTRAVAGANT, TO BE AMUSING, TO BE WITTY, TO BE COQUETTISH, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THAT APPLIES TO MEN, TOO – BUT TO A LOT SMALLER DEGREE. THERE’S DEFINITELY A BIG DIVIDE AS FAR AS I’M CONCERNED.” ALEXANDER FURY: “YOUR AESTHETIC IS VERY DISTINCT AND VERY STRONG AND VERY INDIVIDUAL.” RICK OWENS: “IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE.” ALEXANDER FURY: “WELL, I THINK EVERY DESIGNER’S AESTHETIC IS SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT VERY FEW ACTUALLY GET THAT. BUT I WONDER IF THAT’S POSSIBLY BECAUSE, WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED, THERE WAS THAT PERIOD WHEN IT WAS OUTSIDE OF THIS CATWALK-SHOW SYSTEM.” RICK OWENS: “I WONDER. I DON’T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO A RICK OWENS RIGHT NOW; THAT WAS BEFORE THE CALENDAR WAS AS CROWDED AS IT IS, AND I HAD, LIKE, THIS OUTSIDER, WEIRDO KIND OF SPACE IN TIME WHERE ENOUGH PEOPLE HAD... KIND OF ABSORBED ME, AND THAT KIND OF STOOD WITH ME FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. I DON’T KNOW WHO CAN DO THAT ANY MORE, WHO HAS THAT SPACE AROUND THEM.” ALEXANDER FURY: “DO YOU THINK BEING BASED IN LA HELPED WITH THAT – TO MAKE IT KIND OF AN OUTSIDER PERSPECTIVE FROM THE REST OF AMERICAN FASHION? THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE HELPS WITH THE IDEOLOGICAL DISTANCE?” RICK OWENS: “WELL, I WOULD SAY IT GAVE ME MORE TIME TO DEVELOP MYSELF, BUT I DON’T THINK I CAME [TO PARIS] THAT FULLY DEVELOPED, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I THINK I DEVELOPED MYSELF AFTER I GOT HERE, SO IT WASN’T THAT. I SUPPOSE IT GAVE ME, LIKE... IT MADE ME MORE ATTRACTIVE AS AN OUTSIDER. IT GAVE ME AN OUTSIDER/OUTLAW KIND OF THING. THAT WAS A NICE LABEL.” ALEXANDER FURY: “I GUESS MAYBE THAT MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO PIGEONHOLE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE DOING... ” RICK OWENS: “THE THING THAT IS MY ABSOLUTE BASE IS I SOLD CLOTHES FOR YEARS BEFORE I DID RUNWAY. SO I HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE RETAILERS AND I SOLD MY CLOTHES MYSELF. IT WAS VERY ONE-ON-ONE; IT WASN’T A SHOWROOM, IT WAS ME UP THERE IN THE BACK OFFICE OF THEIR STORES, SHOOTING THE S IT AND HAVING COFFEE AND LOOKING AT THE CLOTHES AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT WAS WORKING AND WHAT WASN’T. AND IT WAS, LIKE, THE MRS BURSTEINS – I DIDN’T SHOOT THE S IT WITH MRS BURSTEIN THAT MUCH, BUT I DID PRESENT MY CLOTHES TO HER. YOU KNOW, JOYCE FROM HONG KONG AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE. IT WAS ALL ABOUT THAT. IT WAS REALLY ABOUT SELLING CLOTHES BEFORE DOING RUNWAY, SO THAT IT WAS VERY RETAIL- BASED, SO THAT GAVE ME A DIFFERENT KIND OF FOUNDATION, I THINK.” ALEXANDER FURY: “IT’S KIND OF ANTI-FASHION IN A WAY AS WELL, BECAUSE IT’S KIND OF CLOTHES RATHER THAN FASHION, IN A SENSE... I DON’T WANT TO SAY CREATING A PRODUCT, BUT CREATING GARMENTS THAT PEOPLE REALLY WEAR... WHAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO, I GUESS... ” RICK OWENS: “YEAH, FOR A WEIRDO, I HAVE A VERY PRACTICAL STREAK. IT WAS VERY MUCH COMMERCIALLY BASED, IN A FUNNY WAY. BUT I MEAN, THERE WAS DEFINITELY ROMANCE THERE, TOO.” ALEXANDER FURY: “DO YOU SEE YOUR WORK AS ANTI-FASHION, AS KIND OF A STAND AGAINST THE FASHION ESTABLISHMENT?” RICK OWENS: “SOMETIMES I THINK I DO. WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT, ONE OF MY DESIRES WAS TO CORRUPT FROM WITHIN. I’VE ALWAYS KIND OF RESENTED THE FACT THAT WHAT THEY PUT ON THE RUNWAY IS EXAGGERATED AND IS RADICAL AND IS KIND OF SAVED ONLY FOR THE RUNWAY. MY IDEA, WHEN I FIRST STARTED MAKING CLOTHES, WAS I WANTED TO BRING A RADICAL SILHOUETTE TO EVERYDAY LIFE. I WANTED TO – NOT MAKE IT LESS SPECIAL – BUT I WANTED TO MAKE EVERY DAY SPECIAL. THE MOST RADICAL SILHOUETTE – IF IT’S SOFTENED IN GREY AND THE MATERIALS ARE MORE NEUTRALISED – I LIKED THE IDEA OF SNEAKING IT INTO DAYTIME. WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT I WAS DOING A LOT OF GREY CASHMERE SKIRTS WITH TRAINS THAT I INSISTED PEOPLE SHOULD WEAR DURING THE DAYTIME – AND PEOPLE DID. I FELT LIKE THAT WAS KIND OF A TRIUMPH. I MEAN, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DID, BUT I FELT THAT, IN A SMALL WAY, IT WAS KIND OF ONE OF THE MOST PUNK-ROCK THINGS I COULD DO WITH CLOTHES. SO IT’S NOT REALLY ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT – I SUPPOSE IT’S ANTI-CONVENTION. LATER ON, GRADUALLY, AS TIME HAS GONE ON, I’VE MAYBE OUTGROWN A LITTLE BIT OF THAT ADOLESCENT REACTION, BUT THEN AGAIN, I HAVEN’T. SOMETIMES I THINK I HAVE, BUT NO, I HAVEN’T, IT’S STILL THERE AND I PROBABLY EVEN CELEBRATE IT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.” ALEXANDER FURY: “I WONDER, AS YOU OBVIOUSLY MOVED FROM LA TO WORK IN PARIS, DO YOU FEEL THAT MOVE AFFECTED THE CLOTHES YOU MAKE? HAS IT SHIFTED YOUR AESTHETIC?” RICK OWENS: “IT HAS PROBABLY SHIFTED IN THE RUNWAY THING. YOU DON’T REALLY KNOW, THOUGH. IT’S REALLY HARD TO SAY BECAUSE I WAS JUST AS ISOLATED IN LOS ANGELES AS I AM IN PARIS. IT’S VERY MUCH THE SAME THING. I WORK AT HOME, SO IT’S HOME, THE GYM, A COUPLE OF RESTAURANTS AROUND THE HOUSE... BUT I THINK THE WHOLE RUNWAY EXPERIENCE MEANS YOU HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCCASION... IT’S CHALLENGING – MORE CHALLENGING BUT IN A WONDERFUL WAY. YEAH, I DON’T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.” ALEXANDER FURY: “I WAS INTERESTED WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW 1930S HOLLYWOOD INFLUENCED YOUR MOODS, BECAUSE I THINK, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, THINKING ABOUT YOUR WORK, IT DOESN’T LINK IN WITH THAT KIND OF IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE OF LA FASHION AND, SPECIFICALLY, OF THAT KIND OF OLD- HOLLYWOOD THING.” RICK OWENS: “WELL, MY LOS ANGELES – THERE WAS HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AND IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND LEGENDS AND A KIND OF MYTHOLOGY OF HOLLYWOOD. BLACK-AND-WHITE HOLLYWOOD. PEOPLE THINK OF LOS ANGELES AS A DIFFERENT THING, SO MINE WAS KIND OF A NICHE LOS ANGELES. VERY DECREPIT – THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE I LIVED, IT WAS, ‘THIS STAR OVERDOSED IN THIS APARTMENT BUILDING’ AND ‘CECIL B DEMILLE USED TO LIVE OVER HERE’, SO IT WAS KIND OF ALL THAT.” ALEXANDER FURY: “I GUESS THERE IS A WEIRD TRAGEDY TO THAT – IT’S WEIRDLY TIED IN WITH THAT HOLLYWOOD STAR SYSTEM AND HOW WHEN IT BROKE DOWN, IT BROKE THE PEOPLE... ” RICK OWENS: “I WAS LIVING IN THE RESIDUE OF OLD HOLLYWOOD.” ALEXANDER FURY: “THE DAY OF THE LOCUST?” RICK OWENS: “YES. THAT’S EXACTLY WHERE I LIVED, AND IT FELT LIKE THAT! IT FELT LIKE THE RESIDUE OF IT BUT I LOVED IT. THAT WAS THE BEST PART ABOUT IT.” ALEXANDER FURY: “DO YOU THINK IT KIND OF MADE YOU RE-APPROACH THAT OLD IDEA OF GLAMOUR – OUR VERY STATIC IDEA OF GLAMOUR – IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY?” RICK OWENS: “IT’S ALL ABOUT GLAMOUR, IT’S ABOUT ALLURE AND IT’S ABOUT CREATING FASCINATION.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN ONE OF OUR MOST PROGRESSIVE AESTHETIC ARENAS, AM I NOT ALLOWED TO USE THIS IMAGERY? IS IT ONLY APPROPRIATE FOR A MICHAEL FASSBENDER MOVIE? I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING QUESTION,” HE WROTE WWD IN AN E-MAIL. OWENS SAID “HAVING BEEN INFLUENCED BY FEAR AND SHAME GROWING UP,” HE “[LOVED] THE IDEA OF PUTTING A MORE LOVING ENERGY OUT THERE WHENEVER I CAN.” “WE ALL KNOW THAT RUNWAY LOOKS AREN’T MEANT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY, THEY ILLUSTRATE AN ETHOS.

WE DIDN’T KNOW THAT THE ADMIRATION WAS RECIPROCAL. IN THIS, THEIR FIRST DIALOGUE, THEY DISCOVER SHARED INTERESTS — MUSIC, DANCE, SEX, AND TRANSGENDER CULTURE — AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON, ONE GENERATION APART. INTERVIEW AND PORTRAIT BY OLIVIER ZAHM. PHOTOGRAPHY BY MARTIEN MULDER. OLIVIER ZAHM — HAD YOU TWO MET BEFORE IN PARIS OR NEW YORK? RICK OWENS — YES. IN PARIS, BECAUSE I NEVER GO TO NEW YORK. SHAYNE OLIVER — WE MET AT PIERRE ROUGIER’S PLACE, WHEN HE HAD THAT LITTLE COCKTAIL PARTY. RICK OWENS — OH RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU’RE 26, SO I NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU IN NEW YORK. OLIVIER ZAHM — YOU DON’T GO TO NEW YORK ANYMORE? RICK OWENS — I NEVER GO TO NEW YORK, AND THE ONLY TIME THAT I EVER REALLY ENJOYED NEW YORK, OR WAS REALLY A PART OF IT, WAS IN THE ’80S. WE WOULD GO TO SALLY’S HIDEAWAY IN TIMES SQUARE. THAT WAS BEFORE YOUR TIME. SALLY’S HIDEAWAY CLOSED BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, PROBABLY. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF IT? SHAYNE OLIVER — NO. ACTUALLY, WHAT IS IT? OLIVIER ZAHM — I NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT. RICK OWENS — YOU KNOW THE GAIETY, RIGHT? BECAUSE THAT’S STILL THERE, BUT SALLY’S HIDEAWAY WAS RIGHT AROUND THERE SOMEWHERE. THERE’S ACTUALLY A WEBSITE DEVOTED TO THE MEMORY OF SALLY’S HIDEAWAY. IT WAS KIND OF AN AFTER-HOURS TRANNY BAR, AND IT WAS, IT WAS, IT WAS … RAW! IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS TRANNIES, THEIR ADMIRERS, AND THEIR CLIENTS. SHAYNE OLIVER — OH, THAT’S A GOOD MIX. RICK OWENS — AND IT WAS OPEN AFTER ALL THE OTHER BARS CLOSED. YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE AND SEE WHO WAS THERE. I DON’T KNOW WHY I BROUGHT THAT UP. YOU REMIND ME OF THAT. I JUST FELT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT BECAUSE THAT’S THE OLD NEW YORK. OLIVIER ZAHM — IS THERE A PLACE OR A CLUB THAT YOU LIKE IN PARIS NOW? RICK OWENS — WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ONE. WHAT IS IT CALLED? SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH. SUNCITY [ON BOULEVARD SÉBASTOPOL]. THEN THERE’S THE SAUNA. AND THERE’S THE CUD [IN THE MARAIS], WHICH IS REALLY FUN. IT’S CHEESY ON TOP AND THEN, WHEN YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS, IT’S A CAVE, AND THEY JUST PLAY KIND OF LIKE BAD REMIXES OF ALL THE POP HITS. THE MUSIC YOU WANT TO DRINK TO, BASICALLY. RICK OWENS — AND I HEARD THERE’S A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM AND FOG. OLIVIER ZAHM — YOU’RE BOTH VERY CONNECTED TO THE MUSIC WORLD OR TO A CERTAIN KIND OF MUSIC, WHICH IS NOT POP, BUT YOU’RE CONNECTED TO HIP-HOP. RICK OWENS — DO WE STILL CALL IT HIP-HOP? SHAYNE OLIVER — WELL, IT SHOULD BE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE. I FEEL LIKE ITS FORMING; IT’S BECOMING SOMETHING WEIRD. RICK OWENS — I LIKED TRAP. I THOUGHT THAT MADE SENSE. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, TRAP IS GOOD. OLIVIER ZAHM — TRAP? RICK OWENS — TECHNO GOING INTO RAP. IT JUST MADE SO MUCH SENSE. THAT’S, LIKE, THE LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF WHAT RAP SHOULD BE. BUT YOU KNOW WHO I’VE BEEN LISTENING TO NOW: LADY. DO YOU KNOW LADY? SHAYNE OLIVER — OH YES, SHE’S SO GOOD! RICK OWENS — LADY IS… AND I MEAN IT’S OLD. IT’S NOT LIKE SHE’S NEW. IT’S NOT THAT, I MEAN, IT’S TWO YEARS OLD. I GOTTA FIND IT, WHERE THE F CK IS IT? [PLAYS SONG.] AND THEN MY FAVORITE SONG OF HERS IS, “HE’LL BE WORKIN’ THAT CLIT, WORKIN’ THAT CLIT. WORK WORKIN’ THAT CLIT.” I’M GOING TO TURN IT OFF NOW. OLIVIER ZAHM — RICK, THE MUSIC YOU CHOOSE FOR YOUR SHOWS IS MORE ABSTRACT OR MINIMAL, NO? RICK OWENS — I DO A LOT OF MINIMAL AND, WITH A FRIEND OF MINE, WE DO ALL THE REMIXING. SO IT’S LIKE I’VE BEEN THROUGH EVERY NOTE OF THAT MUSIC, CHANGING IT AND TWEAKING IT. SHAYNE OLIVER — THAT’S COOL. I DON’T KNOW IF IT WAS A MEN’S SHOW, BUT YOU WERE PLAYING, LIKE, CHICAGO’S JUKE ELLINGTON. RICK OWENS — DOMINATOR. OH, I KNOW WHICH ONE! SHAYNE OLIVER — I WAS LIKE, OKAY! THAT IN PARIS IS A REALLY GOOD LOOK. WE, LIKE, DJ THAT STUFF A LOT, TOO. RICK OWENS — RP BOO. IT WAS RP BOO, AND THEN THE NEXT ONE I DID, JAYLIN AND I COMMISSIONED THEM TO DO THOSE MIXES FOR ME. JAYLIN CAME HERE, AND THAT WAS AMAZING. THAT WAS FUTURISTIC MUSIC. OLIVIER ZAHM — ON BOTH THE CREATIVE AND CONSUMING SIDE, THE MUSIC COMMUNITY IS REALLY INTO THE WAY YOU BOTH DRESS MEN AND WOMEN. RICK OWENS — WHY IS THAT? SHAYNE OLIVER — I DON’T KNOW! I THINK YOU’RE A ROCK STAR. I THINK IT’S A ROCK STAR QUALITY THING. FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE I ENVY MUSICIANS SO MUCH. RICK OWENS — BUT MUSIC IS VERY MUCH IN WHAT YOU DO. IT’S VERY CONNECTED. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, I STARTED DJING. RICK OWENS — YOU’RE NOT DOING PREPPIE. SHAYNE OLIVER — NO. OLIVIER ZAHM — ONE DAY, MAYBE! SHAYNE OLIVER — WELL, MAYBE! NO. WELL, MAYBE GOLF PUNK BUT… I MEAN IT’S JUST HOW I GREW UP. I GREW UP COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE THROUGH MUSIC, SO IT’S PART OF WHAT GENERATES EMOTION FOR ME, LIKE IT CAN CHANGE MY MOOD. I DON’T KNOW. IT’S PERSONAL LIKE THAT. BUT I DO ENVY MUSICIANS, AND SO I THINK I TRY TO BE A MUSICIAN IN A WEIRD WAY. SOMETIMES I WANT TO, LIKE, TOUR, AND HAVE THAT LIFESTYLE. RICK OWENS — BUT IT’S A VERY GAY CULTURE IN A WAY, THE WAY YOU’RE LOOKING AT MUSIC, ISN’T IT? SHAYNE OLIVER — IT IS. I COME FROM THE CLUBS AND… RICK OWENS — OH! YOU HAVE TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO A DEATH DROP. SHAYNE OLIVER — I CAN DO THAT. RICK OWENS — CAN YOU REALLY? SHAYNE OLIVER — I CAN. OLIVIER ZAHM — WHAT IS A DEATH DROP? RICK OWENS — IT’S WHERE YOU KIND OF TURN AROUND AND THEN FALL BACKWARD AND LAND WITH ONE LEG UP AND THE OTHER ONE BACK, AND THEN YOU PICK YOURSELF BACK UP. BUT THE THING IS, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH AND FALL INTO IT. I CAN’T DO IT. SHAYNE OLIVER — YOU KNOW, IT’S LIKE PRACTICING A NEW MUSCLE. IT’S GOING TO HURT. RICK OWENS — BECAUSE IT’S THE LEG-UNDERNEATH-YOU THING. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, IT HURTS FOR THE FIRST, LIKE, TWO WEEKS, AND THEN YOU’RE OKAY; THEN YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. RICK OWENS — OKAY, IMAGINE A 52-YEAR-OLD MAN IN A HOTEL ROOM, WATCHING… SHAYNE OLIVER — DID YOU TRY IT ALREADY? RICK OWENS — FOR LIKE A WEEK, I WAS WORKING ON IT! AND I WAS THINKING, I’M FIT, I CAN DO THIS. I’M NOT AFRAID OF A LITTLE PAIN, AND I HAD FEMININE DESTRUCTION ON YOUTUBE. SHE DOES IT REALLY GREAT, SO I WAS LIKE, “I CAN JUST DO IT REALLY SLOW, BREAK IT DOWN, AND FIGURE IT OUT, RIGHT?” AND I JUST COULDN’T DO IT, BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS POINT WHERE THERE’S NO LOGIC TO IT; YOU JUST HAVE TO THROW YOURSELF INTO IT AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. SHAYNE OLIVER — YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO INJURE YOURSELF. RICK OWENS — AND THEY’RE CHUNKY, THESE GIRLS, SOME OF THEM. AND THE BRAVERY OF IT, IT’S AN ADRENALINE THING. IT’S LIKE THROWING YOURSELF OFF A CLIFF AND YOUR HAIR FLIPS UP, AND THEN YOU JUMP BACK UP. AND THE JUMPING BACK UP, I DON’T KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT. SHOW US HOW YOU DO IT. SHAYNE OLIVER — DO YOU WANT TO SEE ONE? SHOULD I DO IT HERE? OLIVIER ZAHM — DON’T KILL YOURSELF! SHAYNE OLIVER — I DO IT ALL THE TIME. SO, HOLD ON. [PERFORMS A DEATH DROP] RICK OWENS — OH! ISN’T THAT GORGEOUS? I THINK THAT’S THE INVENTION OF THE CENTURY! THAT IS THE INVENTION OF OUR GENERATION. I HOPE I DIDN’T PUSH YOU INTO THAT! SHAYNE OLIVER — OH NO, TRUST ME, I DO THAT FIVE TIMES IN A ROW. BUT YOU SEE, IT’S EASY AFTER YOU BREAK. OLIVIER ZAHM — SHAYNE, WHEN YOU STARTED YOUR BRAND, DID YOU KNOW ABOUT RICK’S WORK? SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, FOR SURE. I REMEMBER SEEING IMAGES OF THE THING YOU DID AT PITTI IN FLORENCE. I SAW THAT. RICK OWENS — DID YOU SEE THE BOOK THAT I DID WITH ME PEEING IN MY MOUTH? SHAYNE OLIVER — YES. RICK OWENS — BUT IT WAS LIKE THE STATUE PEEING ACTUALLY. SHAYNE OLIVER — YES, WHICH WAS GREAT. WHEN I SAW THAT, I WAS LIKE, THIS PERSON KNOWS. RICK OWENS — PISS IS AN EYECATCHER! [LAUGHS] SHAYNE OLIVER — SO IMMEDIATELY I WAS DRAWN TO THAT. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SOLD AT ATELIER [ED. NOTE: AN AVANT-GARDE BOUTIQUE IN NEW YORK]? RICK OWENS — FOR A LONG TIME. SHAYNE OLIVER — I WOULD GO TO ATELIER. I WOULD GO IN THE SHOP, AND I WOULD SEE STUFF AND THEN, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WOULD EDUCATE ME ON, I GUESS, THE SIMILARITIES OF BEING AMERICAN AND BLAH, BLAH, THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. AND YEAH, THAT’S WHEN I BECAME FAMILIAR WITH YOUR WORK. RICK OWENS — SO YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING. YOU FOUND ATELIER. SHAYNE OLIVER — OH YEAH. I GUESS BEING AN ONLY CHILD, I’M VERY CURIOUS. RICK OWENS — YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO AMUSE YOURSELF. I’M AN ONLY CHILD, TOO. OLIVIER ZAHM — REALLY? RICK OWENS — YEAH, AND I THINK THAT’S A BIG PART OF IT. SHAYNE OLIVER — YOU LOOK, YOU SEARCH, YOU GO OUT, YOU NAVIGATE. THAT’S HOW I FOUND ALL THE SHOPS IN NEW YORK AND HOW I GOT INTO JUST, LIKE, EVERYTHING TO BE HONEST. OLIVIER ZAHM — RICK’S STYLE AND VISION OF FASHION IS SO UNIQUE AND EXTRAORDINARILY FREE. YOU BRING NOT ONLY FRESH AIR, BUT A SORT OF RADICAL EASINESS, TOO, WHICH IS REALLY RELEVANT TODAY. RICK OWENS — I WISH. I NEVER THINK I PUSH MYSELF FAR ENOUGH. OLIVIER ZAHM — YOUR WORK, RICK, EVEN THOUGH YOU MOVED TO PARIS, HAS A BIG ECHO IN AMERICA. RICK OWENS — YEAH, BUT THE THING IS WHEN I LOOK AT NEW YORK, I WONDER: WHERE ARE THE CALVINS? WHERE ARE THE DONNA KARANS? WHEN I LOOK THERE, I DON’T REALLY SEE THE LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THAT. I MEAN, I THINK WHAT SHAYNE IS DOING IS LOGICAL; THAT’S WHAT CLOTHES SHOULD BE NOW. THEY SHOULDN’T BE REHASHED ’70S CLOTHES. THEY SHOULD BE MODERN. AND THAT’S WHY YOUR MOMENT IS SO GREAT: YOU KIND OF OWN THAT NEWNESS. OLIVIER ZAHM — IT’S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY! IT’S ON YOUR SHOULDERS! RICK OWENS — DON’T F CK IT UP! SHAYNE OLIVER — NO, I WON’T, I WON’T, I WON’T! RICK OWENS — HE WON’T. OF COURSE HE WON’T. NO, BUT ALSO, IF I CAN GIVE ANY ADVICE TO ANYBODY, IF I COULD BE SO POMPOUS: ONE THING THAT I HAD TO LEARN THAT TOOK ME A WHILE WAS NOT TO FEEL RESPONSIBLE. DON’T FEEL ANY RESPONSIBILITY; JUST DO WHATEVER THE F CK YOU WANT, AND THAT’S WHAT’S GOING TO BE TRUE. BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINUTE WHEN I FELT RESPONSIBLE, AND I WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT PEOPLE WERE DOING AND THOUGHT, “HOW DO I MAINTAIN THIS MOMENTUM?” THAT WAS A MISTAKE. YOU REALLY HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOUR OWN GUT: “WHAT DO I REALLY THINK IS COOL, AND WHAT DO I REALLY LIKE?” THAT’S WHAT I SHOULD DO. THERE’S A MINUTE WHERE IT’S NOT THAT EASY. THERE ARE A LOT OF VOICES. OLIVIER ZAHM — ESPECIALLY WHEN, SUDDENLY, THERE’S A SPOTLIGHT ON YOUR NAME AND ON YOUR COLLECTION. RICK OWENS — ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU’RE THE GUEST AT PITTI. HE’S GOING TO BE IN PITTI, WHICH IS, OF COURSE, A BIG SIGN OF ARRIVAL. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, THANKS! I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING FUN. LET’S HOPE THAT VENUE ALLOWS IT! FLORENCE IS OLD. BUT I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT TO DO. RICK OWENS — YOU REALLY CAN, AND THEY’RE GOING TO ENCOURAGE YOU. THEY’RE VERY OPEN TO EXTREME. SHAYNE OLIVER — RIGHT, THEY WERE ENCOURAGING ME TO DO WHATEVER. I DON’T WANT TO GO THERE AND BE LIKE, “OH, THIS IS SO NICE. I SHOULD DO SOMETHING NICE.” RICK OWENS — THEY’RE VERY INTELLECTUAL AND ARTSY, AND YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO RISE TO THAT. YOU’RE NOT GOING TO FEEL LIKE YOU’RE WITH YOUR GRANDMA. OLIVIER ZAHM — BY THE TIME YOU’VE DONE IT, THIS ISSUE WILL ALREADY BE OUT. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH. IT WILL BE COLD. I WISH IT WAS THE SUMMER ONE. RICK OWENS — WHAT ABOUT YOUR PRODUCTION? YOU’RE PRODUCING AT THE SAME TIME IN NEW YORK? SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH. RICK OWENS — SO YOU’RE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, IT’S A CRAZY MOMENT. I’M ACTUALLY HAVING TO BE A BUSINESSPERSON, WHICH IS SO WEIRD. IT’S JUST ABOUT MANAGING IT SO THAT IT DOESN’T GET OUT OF CONTROL FOR US. BUT IT IS GROWING RATHER FAST. OLIVIER ZAHM — HOW DO YOU BOTH FEEL ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMERICA AND EUROPE. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE IN PARIS, RICK? YOU’RE ALMOST A PARISIAN AFTER 10 YEARS! RICK OWENS — IT’S 12 NOW, AND I NEVER LEARNED FRENCH. I’M REALLY IN A LITTLE BUBBLE, SO I’M NOT MUCH OF A PARISIAN. I’M JUST AN ALIEN. A RESIDENT ALIEN. OLIVIER ZAHM — A RESIDENT ALIEN! RICK OWENS — YEAH, I LOVE THAT PHRASE. SHAYNE OLIVER — THAT’S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT PARIS, TOO, IN A WAY, BECAUSE I DON’T KNOW ANYONE HERE, AND I’M NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING. I CAN BE CRAZY AND FREE. RICK OWENS — LIKE SUNCITY. NOBODY’S GOING TO KNOW YOU AT SUNCITY. SHAYNE OLIVER — BASICALLY. RICK OWENS — IN YOUR NEW PURSUIT OF YOUR NEW FETISH, WHICH IS… SHAYNE OLIVER — F-TO-M. FEMALE-TO-MALE. I’M GETTING INTO THAT. I THINK THAT THEY’RE ALLURING. RICK OWENS — WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MALES? SHAYNE OLIVER — YES. SO BASICALLY THEY’RE WOMEN THAT BECOME MEN TO BECOME GAY MEN. RICK OWENS — THAT’S A JOURNEY. SHAYNE OLIVER — THAT PERSON IS COMPOSED AND POISED! NO, IT’S VERY PARTICULAR. OLIVIER ZAHM — I WANT TO COME BACK TO FASHION. HOW DO YOU BOTH SEE PARIS FASHION AND THE WORLD OF FASHION IN GENERAL? DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT OR NOT? SHAYNE OLIVER — I’M NOT FROM PARIS SO I DON’T SEE IT. IT’S NOT PART OF MY SYSTEM, SO I’M KIND OF PERFORMING IN FRONT OF A CROWD. OLIVIER ZAHM — LIKE A MUSICIAN. SHAYNE OLIVER — RIGHT, BASICALLY. SO I’M HERE, AND I’M ON TOUR LOOKING FOR ALL THE GROUPIES. [LAUGHS] RICK OWENS — BUT WAIT, YOU MUST HAVE GROUPIES. SHAYNE OLIVER — I’M STARTING TO, WHICH IS WEIRD. RICK OWENS — ARE YOU TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT? SHAYNE OLIVER — NOT YET. ACTUALLY, I DON’T HAVE ENOUGH CLOUT IN MY OWN COMPANY YET, IN THE SENSE THAT I DON’T HAVE GOOD ACCOMMODATIONS. I HAVE S ITTY HOTEL ROOMS, SO I CAN’T BRING ANYONE TO THESE HOTELS. THEY’RE REALLY BAD. OLIVIER ZAHM — IT WILL CHANGE SOON… SHAYNE OLIVER — NEXT SEASON! THIS TIME WE STAYED AT A HOUSE, AND EVERYBODY WAS RAGING THERE, AND WE ALMOST GOT KICKED OUT BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS BEING SO WILD, SO WE’RE LIKE VERY UNSTABLE IN PARIS. WE GET A PLACE HERE EVERY TIME. WE USUALLY GO ON AIRBNB AND GET A LITTLE APARTMENT, AND WE ALWAYS ALMOST GET KICKED OUT… DID YOU MEET HAKEEM? RICK OWENS — I DON’T REMEMBER. SHAYNE OLIVER — A WILD QUEEN WHO ALWAYS GETS US ALMOST KICKED OUT. HE’S GONE TO THE HOSPITAL EVERY TIME HE’S BEEN IN PARIS. SOMETHING SEXUAL. NOT AN INFECTION, BUT A SEXUAL INJURY. HE BROKE HIS D CK TWICE IN PARIS. THIS TIME HE BLEW HIS BACK OUT; HE LOST THE KEYS TO THE PLACE. WE HAD TWO COPIES; HE LOST BOTH. RICK OWENS — HOW DO YOU BREAK YOUR D CK? I MEAN, I KNOW, I CAN IMAGINE. OLIVIER ZAHM — LIKE F CKING TOO HARD? RICK OWENS — I GUESS IF YOU BEND IT WRONG. SHAYNE OLIVER — I COULDN’T. BUT IT HAPPENED. AND HE WAS BLEEDING ALL OVER THIS, IT WAS SOME FRENCH ACTRESS THAT I CAN’T REMEMBER HER NAME, BUT SHE HAD A PLACE ON AIRBNB, AND HE BLED ALL OVER HER CARPET. RICK OWENS — TRY TO REMEMBER HER NAME BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE GOOD. OLIVIER ZAHM — WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR INFLUENCES, SHAYNE? RICK OWENS — YOU WERE NEVER LOOKING THROUGH OLD 1940S VOGUES AND THINKING OF DIOR AND ALL OF THAT STUFF, WERE YOU? SHAYNE OLIVER — WELL, I GREW UP IN THE TV MOMENT, WHERE IT WAS, LIKE, FASHION TELEVISION, SO THIS HAPPENED, AND I WAS LOOKING AT KARL LAGERFELD. I WOULD SEE THAT, AND IT WOULD LEAD ME TO INVESTIGATE, AS AN ONLY KID WOULD. RICK OWENS — ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH HIM YET? SHAYNE OLIVER — WELL, WE KIND OF MET THROUGH THE LVMH PRIZE THING, AND HE WAS SUPER SWEET. OLIVIER ZAHM — HE WAS SUPPORTING YOU, HE TOLD ME. I WAS WITH HIM AN HOUR AGO, AND I TOLD HIM I HAD TO LEAVE TO SEE YOU GUYS — “SORRY KARL, I HAVE TO GO!” — AND HE SAID, “I LOVE THIS GUY. I PUSHED HIM, AND THEY CUT ME,” BECAUSE YOU DIDN’T GET THE PRIZE, RIGHT? SHAYNE OLIVER — I WON A SPECIAL PRIZE. ISN’T THAT SO F CKED? NO, NO. [LAUGHS] THEY GAVE ME THE MENSWEAR SPECIAL PRIZE. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT KARL WAS REALLY PUSHING FOR YOU. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, HE AND PHOEBE WERE HUGE. I THINK PHOEBE’S USED TO HANGING OUT WITH DUDES, SO SHE CONNECTED TO THAT THING. SHE’S A TOMBOY, SO SHE KIND OF WAS INTO THAT. AND KARL WAS ACTUALLY REALLY FUNNY. HE TOLD ME TO GET UP AND WALK AROUND THE ROOM IN MY OUTFIT. HE WAS LIKE, YOU WEAR YOUR CLOTHES THE BEST. YOU SHOULD WALK AROUND IN YOUR CLOTHES. SO I DIDN’T WALK THE ROOM, BUT I JUST STOOD UP AND I WAS LIKE… RICK OWENS — YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A F CKING DEATH DROP! SHAYNE OLIVER — CAN YOU IMAGINE! [LAUGHS] RICK OWENS — YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN PRESS FOR F CKING SURE! SHAYNE OLIVER — I KNOW! SEE, I WASN’T IN THAT MINDSET AT THE MOMENT. I HAD PIERRE ROUGIER BEHIND ME. HE WAS BEING LIKE A FATHER FIGURE. LIKE WHAT’S UP, DO GOOD, AND SO I WASN’T THINKING LIKE THAT. OLIVIER ZAHM — SO, RICK, YOU DON’T MISS AMERICA? YOU DON’T MISS NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES? RICK OWENS — OH, I THINK I DO A LITTLE BIT, BUT I’M JUST SO BUSY. I DO WATCH OLD SITCOMS AND STUFF. SHAYNE OLIVER — WHICH ONES? RICK OWENS — THE LAST ONE I WATCHED WAS WITH LISA KUDROW, THE COMEBACK. IT WAS VERY LA, ABOUT LA ACTRESSES BEING REALLY FAKE. IT’S KIND OF FUNNY. THERE IS AN AMERICANNESS THAT SOMETIMES I DO MISS. BUT IT’S THERE, AND IT WILL BE THERE WHEN I GET BACK. SHAYNE OLIVER — IT’S CONTINUING. I’M A SITCOM PERSON, TOO. I LIKE OLD ONES THAT I NEVER GOT TO SEE. I WATCH ELLEN AND SCRUBS. RICK OWENS — WAS SCRUBS BEFORE YOUR TIME? SHAYNE OLIVER — IT WAS WHEN I WAS MAYBE 10. I COULDN’T GET INTO IT, BUT NOW, LOOKING BACK, I THINK THEY ARE SO GOOD. OLIVIER ZAHM — SO AMERICAN DESIGNERS WATCH SITCOMS! THEY DON’T WATCH 1970S MOVIES? RICK OWENS — YEAH, THEY TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUSLY. BUT I THINK YOU’RE WATCHING IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. I THINK YOU’RE WATCHING IT IN A TWISTED WAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT KIND OF SITCOM LIFE. IT’S WEIRD; IT’S PERVERSE. MY GENERATION LEARNED ALL OF THE LINES TO MOMMIE DEAREST WITH FAYE DUNAWAY. YOUR GENERATION DOES SITCOMS, I THINK. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, WE DO. LIKE FRIENDS AND ALL THIS SORT OF THING. THAT IS WHERE I GET MY HUMOR FOR SURE. RICK OWENS — BUT IT’S ALMOST, LIKE, NOT A SARDONIC HUMOR, BUT A WEIRD HUMOR. I MEAN, YOU’RE NOT TAKING IT; YOU’RE NOT LAUGHING AT IT THE WAY THE WRITERS INTENDED YOU TO, I DON’T THINK. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, NOT AT ALL. I MEAN, WE HAVE A WAY OF MAKING EVERYTHING GAY. EVEN IF IT’S NOT MEANT TO BE. OLIVIER ZAHM — DID YOU GO TO THE LAST JEAN PAUL GAULTIER SHOW? RICK OWENS — YEAH, I WENT. HE’S ALWAYS BEEN VERY FRIENDLY, AND I LOVE HONORING PEOPLE. I THINK HE IS AN AESTHETIC ICON OF OUR GENERATION. AND WE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE THINGS HE’S DOING NOW, BUT HE’S RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MUCH STUFF. SHAYNE OLIVER — HE’S DONE EVERYTHING. I GUESS LOOKING AT IT THIS WAY, I THINK HE LOOKED AT AMERICAN THINGS AND THEN MADE THEM VERY, I DON’T KNOW, PARISIAN — NOT PARISIAN, BUT JUST FASHION. HE’S DONE SO MUCH; IT’S CRAZY. I LOOK AT THINGS, AND I’M, LIKE, “THAT IS GAULTIER.” OLIVIER ZAHM — I DON’T THINK HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT HE IS. HE’S BEEN QUITE ISOLATED IN THE PAST YEARS. SHAYNE OLIVER — I WOULD SAY THAT. I THINK HE’S BEEN ISOLATED. I DON’T KNOW WHO IS HIS TEAM. OLIVIER ZAHM — JEAN PAUL GAULTIER HAS HIS FRIENDS AND HIS FANS, BUT I’M NOT SURE HE GOT ENOUGH SUPPORT. BUT HE’S STILL HERE WITH COUTURE. HE WILL GO ON, AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. BUT IT WAS GREAT TO SEE HIM THERE. RICK OWENS — PIERRE CARDIN WAS THERE. I SEE PIERRE CARDIN ALL THE TIME BECAUSE HE GOES TO THE CAFÉ AT THE CORNER. I WAS TELLING MICHÈLE, LIKE I GO, “OH MY GOD, I THINK THAT’S PIERRE CARDIN.” AND HE COMES OVER AND INTRODUCES HIMSELF. HE SAID HELLO, AND I ALMOST FAINTED. SHAYNE OLIVER — THAT’S AMAZING! RICK OWENS — PIERRE CARDIN, HOW MUCH MORE FRENCH CAN YOU GET? I MEAN, PIERRE CARDIN KNOWS I EXIST? THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. I WAS THRILLED, ANYHOW. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST GLAMOROUS THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, THAT’S PRETTY GOOD, FOR SURE. OLIVIER ZAHM — HE STILL HAS A BEAUTIFUL SHOP ON RUE DE RIVOLI, NO RUE DE FAUBOURG SAINT-HONORÉ, WHERE YOU CAN DO SEMI-COUTURE. RICK OWENS — I NEVER KNEW IF IT WAS REALLY OPEN OR NOT. I MEAN I KIND OF DRIVE BY, AND I SEE THE WINDOWS. OLIVIER ZAHM — STOP BY ONE DAY BECAUSE YOU’LL SEE THAT THE CARDIN SHOP IS THE SAME. IT’S BEAUTIFUL. THEY STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL DRESSES, AND YOU CAN HAVE ONE MADE FOR YOU IN THE ATELIER UPSTAIRS. SO IT’S QUITE OLD-FASHIONED. IT’S QUITE EXPENSIVE, TOO, BUT IT’S NOT READY-TO-WEAR. SHAYNE OLIVER — WHY DO YOUNG GIRLS NOT LIKE THAT? I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DON’T LIKE THAT. RICK OWENS — BECAUSE WE’RE ALL TOO FAST NOW. WHO HAS TIME FOR FITTINGS? SHAYNE OLIVER — WELL, NOBODY HAS TIME FOR THAT, OF COURSE. RICK OWENS — AND ALSO, NO ONE’S PATIENT ENOUGH. IT TAKES PATIENCE. OLIVIER ZAHM — THERE’S A LINK BETWEEN YOU TWO AND PIERRE CARDIN IN A WAY: THIS RADICALITY OF DOING A UNIFORM. RICK OWENS — OH RIGHT, UNIFORMS. OLIVIER ZAHM — AND WORKING WITH MONOCHROME, TRYING TO FIND A NEW SILHOUETTE. BEING CONSISTENT, PUSHING IT. NOT COMPROMISING. AND THEN PIERRE CARDIN BECAME A COMMERCIAL EMPIRE, BUT HE ALWAYS HAD THIS VISION. RICK OWENS — WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR FIRST MILLION, SHAYNE? SHAYNE OLIVER — I DON’T KNOW. I HAVEN’T STARTED BALLIN’ YET. MAYBE WHEN I START FEELING IT IS WHEN I WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I WOULD DO WITH, LIKE, MONEY. I’D LIKE MY TEAM TO BE COMFORTABLE. I’D LIKE ALL MY FRIENDS TO BE REALLY HAPPY. RICK OWENS — HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HERE WITH YOU, ACTUALLY? HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU NEED TO BRING? SHAYNE OLIVER — IAN, LILA, HAKEEM, WHO ELSE WAS HERE? PAUL. PHILIP IS HERE. PEGGY WAS HERE. RICK OWENS — SO YOU HAVE AN ENTOURAGE. SHAYNE OLIVER — MY GOOD FRIEND PEGGY IS THE ENTERTAINMENT CHICK. OLIVIER ZAHM — THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PARIS WITH YOU? WHAT ABOUT IN NEW YORK? SHAYNE OLIVER — WELL THOSE ARE THE CORE PEOPLE I WORK WITH IN GENERAL, AS WELL AS A GRAPHICS PERSON. ROMINA, EMILY, SOME INTERNS. IT’S REALLY SMALL. IT’S PROBABLY LIKE 10, MAXIMUM. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT YOU KEEP A REALLY SMALL TEAM VERY CLOSE. SHAYNE OLIVER — I MEAN, IT’S HEALTHY. THAT’S THE ONLY WAY I LIKE IT. I KIND OF LIKE TO KEEP EVERYTHING A SECRET, EVEN IN THE COMPANY. I GUESS I NEED TO LET IT GO SOON, RIGHT? RICK OWENS — YOU CAN KEEP SECRETS. SHAYNE OLIVER — I LIKE TO KEEP THEM EVEN FROM THE TEAM. I’M JUST LIKE, YOU CAN’T KNOW THIS THING ABOUT THE COLLECTION. IT JUST FEELS BETTER. IT FEELS LIKE IT’S GOOD WHEN THE TEAM IS EXCITED MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE WHEN THE IDEA COMES ACROSS. RICK OWENS — EVEN MY CEO AND MICHÈLE DON’T SEE THE COLLECTION UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE IT GOES OUT. SHAYNE OLIVER — DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT AFTER AWHILE? RICK OWENS — NO, THAT’S KIND OF HOW IT ALWAYS WAS, AND THAT’S WHAT FEELS GOOD. BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IF MICHÈLE EVEN RAISED AN EYEBROW, IT WOULD DISTRACT ME. SHAYNE OLIVER — YOU WOULD SCRAP THE WHOLE THING. RICK OWENS — I WOULD JUST QUESTION MYSELF. OLIVIER ZAHM — IT’S BETTER TO KEEP IT INTIMATE. RICK OWENS — NO, SOLITARY. SO THAT I CAN REALLY TRY AND MAKE IT AS PURE AS POSSIBLE, AND THEN AFTERWARDS IT DOESN’T MATTER. SHAYNE OLIVER — SOMETIMES YOU’RE WORKING ON AN IDEA, AND YOU HAVEN’T FIGURED IT OUT YET. I HATE TO PREMATURELY GIVE SOMEONE AN IDEA. IT JUST FEELS NEGATIVE. IT FEELS LIKE THERE’S NO HOPE. I’D RATHER UNDERSTAND THE IDEA FIRST AND THEN REVEAL IT. IT’S ALSO EXCITING THAT WAY. IT’S FUN. RICK OWENS — AND THEN IT’S ALL YOURS, TOO. COMPLETELY YOURS. SHAYNE OLIVER — EXACTLY. OLIVIER ZAHM — RICK, OF COURSE, HAS MEN’S AND WOMEN’S COLLECTIONS, BUT ALSO FURNITURE. HE’S CREATED A WHOLE AESTHETIC AROUND HIS WORLD — THE SHOP, THE DESIGN OF THE BOUTIQUE. EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE, AND EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED, EVEN YOUR OWN BODY, EVEN YOUR OWN HOME. SHAYNE, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ACHIEVE THIS KIND OF UNIFIED WORLD? SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, I THINK IT’S NATURAL, JUST BASED ON THE THOUGHT PROCESS, HOW THE IDEAS COME ALONG AND, LIKE, HOW I LIVE THE IDEAS. I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S FURNITURE, BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT CAN BE OBJECTS, IT CAN BE SOUNDS. OLIVIER ZAHM — MAYBE YOUR WORK IS ALSO CONNECTED TO SEXUALITY, NO? SHAYNE OLIVER — [LAUGHS] YEAH. OLIVIER ZAHM — MAYBE MORE THAN RICK’S. RICK OWENS — MINE IS MAYBE THE REJECTION OF SEX! SHAYNE OLIVER — YOU THINK!? I DON’T KNOW. RICK OWENS — NO, THERE’S SEX THERE, BUT IT’S IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SHAYNE OLIVER — I’VE NEVER BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP, EVER. SO I DON’T HAVE THESE SORT OF COMFORT ATTACHMENTS, AND I FEEL LIKE MY ENERGY GOES INTO EVERYONE, LOVING EVERYONE, WHETHER IT BE COMMUNICATIVE OR SEXUAL. I’M NOT A SEXUAL EXTREMIST. I’M MORE OF A SEXUAL DEVIANT. I LIKE TO F CK — BASICALLY I’M HORNY. [LAUGHS] RICK OWENS — THERE WAS A FAMOUS DEPARTMENT STORE THAT KIND OF DID A BIG CAMPAIGN WITH TRANSGENDERS AND STUFF, AND IT FELT A LITTLE FALSE TO ME, BUT THERE’S THIS FEELING THAT PEOPLE WANT TO CELEBRATE THAT A LITTLE BIT, AND YOU ARE THE GENUINE THING. WITH THAT SEXUALITY, ALL DIFFERENT SEXUALITIES ARE COMBINED. AND ALSO, IN YOUR WORLD, THERE’S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT; ALL OPTIONS ARE OPEN. I THINK THAT’S WHAT WAS A LITTLE SELF-CONGRATULATORY ABOUT THIS DEPARTMENT STORE THING. OLIVIER ZAHM — I DON’T KNOW THIS SHOP. RICK OWENS — THAT WAS LAST YEAR, I THINK. AND ACTUALLY I THOUGHT OF YOU DURING THAT BECAUSE THEY’RE MAKING A HYPE THING OUT OF IT, AND YOU GUYS ARE DOING THE REAL THING — ABOUT TOLERANCE. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT LET’S START AT THE BEGINNING, WITH VIVIENNE WESTWOOD AND THE SEX BOUTIQUE. RICK OWENS — RIGHT, RIGHT. SHAYNE OLIVER — I THINK VIVIENNE WAS AGGRESSIVE, NO? RICK OWENS — IT WAS ANGRY. IT WASN’T ABOUT INCLUSION AND TOLERANCE; IT WAS ABOUT “WE HATE YOU.” SHAYNE OLIVER — I THINK NOW I’M MORE ABOUT FLUIDITY OF IDENTITY. LIKE, YOU CAN ASSIGN ANY ROLE TO ANYONE, REALLY. THAT’S JUST LIKE GROWING UP IN NEW YORK AND SEEING EVERYONE, LITERALLY, AND GROWING UP WITH TRANNIES, AND TRANNIES DRESSING BUSINESSMEN UP AS TRANNIES. RICK OWENS — AND SELF-INVENTION. WHICH IS FANTASTIC. SHAYNE OLIVER — AND BECAUSE IT’S SO SEXUAL, THAT DEFINITELY REFERENCES THE THINGS VIVIENNE DID. OLIVIER ZAHM — WHY DO YOU SEE VIVIENNE AS AGGRESSIVE? SHE’S TOO STRICTLY HETEROSEXUAL? SHAYNE OLIVER — I THINK IT WAS HETERO FINDING HOMO INTERESTING. RICK OWENS — I THINK IT WAS CONFRONTATIONAL. PROVOCATIVE IN A HOSTILE WAY, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. MAYBE I’M INTERPRETING IT WRONG. OLIVIER ZAHM — IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BRITISH? RICK OWENS — OF THE POLITICS AT THE TIME? THAT’S WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. SHAYNE OLIVER — AND USING HOMOSEXUALITY AS A TOOL TO PUSH PEOPLE TO GET ANGRY OR BE OFFENDED. I MEAN, HAVING A T-SHIRT THAT HAS A MAN FISTING ANOTHER MAN. AT THAT TIME, I’M SURE IT WAS MEANT TO AGGRAVATE. OLIVIER ZAHM — I WAS JUST MENTIONING IT BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE PUNK PERIOD, AND ONE OF THE FIRST EXPLICIT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SEXUALITY AND FASHION. RICK OWENS — I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE MINISKIRTS AND THAT BEING SUCH AN AMAZING REACTION TO WHAT’S HAPPENING IN SOCIETY. AND THAT WOMEN WOULD HAVE BEEN EMPOWERED, AND SHOWING THAT THEY WERE AVAILABLE TO HAVE SEX ON THEIR OWN TERMS WITH THE PILL. BUT, YOU KNOW, NOW I THINK THE MINISKIRT IS OVER. MINISKIRTS KINDA BUG ME. THEY’RE MY BÊTE NOIRE. OLIVIER ZAHM — WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO GAULTIER. DID HE DO THE FIRST SKIRT FOR MEN? RICK OWENS — I THINK PIERRE CARDIN DID. SHAYNE OLIVER — OH REALLY? RICK OWENS — AND THEN RUDI GERNREICH DID. EVERY DESIGNER THAT WANTS TO PUSH THINGS HAS DONE THAT. SHAYNE OLIVER — YEAH, FOR SURE. RICK OWENS — BUT IN THEIR OWN WAY. BUT I KNOW THAT RUDI GERNREICH DID, BUT THEY WERE MORE LIKE MINISKIRTS; IT WAS LIKE A SPACE UNIFORM. THEY HAD SHAVED HEADS; EVERYTHING WAS SHAVED, AND THEY HAD LIKE A LITTLE MINISKIRT. IT WAS GORGEOUS. YOU SHOULD DO THAT. YOU HAVE A SHAVED HEAD. SHAYNE OLIVER — I KNOW, I SHOULD GET INTO THAT LOOK. RICK OWENS — IT WAS A LITTLE DOUBLE-KNIT MINISKIRT WORN BAREFOOT, AND IT WAS KIND OF A SPACE, AZTEC-SLAVE LOOK. SHAYNE OLIVER — OH! WOW. HMM. RICK OWENS — IT WAS REALLY COOL. IT WAS BOTH SEXES — WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, NOT BISEXUAL, UH, UNISEX! SHAYNE OLIVER — UGH. I HATE THAT TERM SO MUCH. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT THERE’S NO RIGHT WORD FOR THIS COMBINATION. FOR THIS TRANSGENDING… SHAYNE OLIVER — I THINK UNISEX TRIES TO DRAW THE SEXUALITY OUT OF THINGS, MAKING IT NONSEXUAL AND NOT SEXY. AND I HATE THAT SO MUCH. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SAPIOSEXUAL, WHEN THE MIND OF THE PERSON IS WHAT YOU’RE ATTRACTED TO THE MOST, OR THAT’S WHAT TURNS YOU ON. I MEAN THAT’S WHAT WE’RE THINKING THAT IT IS. THIS IS A THING: WE LIVE IT; WE DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S CALLED YET. WE’RE JUST KIND OF FIGURING IT OUT. SAPIOSEXUAL IS WHAT WE’VE FOUND IN, I GUESS, FREUDIAN THEORY, WHICH HELPS TO FIGURE IT OUT. HOW DOES THIS PERSON OPERATE UP HERE, AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE REST OF THEIR BODY? OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT ACTUALLY YOUR FASHION, RICK, IS SO VERY SEXUAL. EVEN THOUGH YOU DON’T SHOW ANYTHING. WE DON’T SEE ANY PART OF THE BODY REALLY. THERE’S SOMETHING EXTREMELY FETISHIST IN YOUR FASHION. RICK OWENS — WELL, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE. CLOTHING JUST HAS TO BE. SHAYNE OLIVER — I THINK THE EROTICISM IS THE CONFIDENCE. LIKE, RICK’S WORK IS NOT MACHO; IT’S CONFIDENT, AND IT’S SEXY BECAUSE OF THAT. RICK OWENS — I LIKE FETISHES. I LIKE THE IDEA OF THEM. I DON’T THINK I HAVE ANY, PERSONALLY, BUT I’M FASCINATED WITH FETISHES. I LOVE THE CEREMONY OF IT. SHAYNE OLIVER — I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT. GETTING READY. IT’S A CEREMONY. IT IS VERY COOL TO SEE PEOPLE GET INTO THEIR FETISH AND PREPARE. RICK OWENS — AND JUST THE SIMPLE THING OF AN AVERAGE WOMAN DECIDING, “I’M PUTTING ON RED LIPSTICK NOW.” THAT’S SUCH AN AMAZING THING. BECAUSE IT’S SUCH AN ABSTRACT, BIZARRE THING TO DO. LIKE, PUT THIS RED THING ON YOUR LIPS? IT’S NOT ONLY ABOUT SEX. IT’S ALSO ABOUT NEATNESS AND PUNCTUATION, AND IT’S ABOUT POLISH AND REFINEMENT. SHAYNE OLIVER — THAT WOMAN HAS HER S IT TOGETHER BECAUSE SHE HAS ON A RED LIP, BASICALLY. RICK OWENS — YEAH, BUT IT’S TRUE. AND IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE ABOUT SEX. A VERY RESPECTABLE WOMAN CAN AT ONE TIME, ONE HOUR, OR ONE POINT IN THE DAY PUT ON HER LIPSTICK, AND THINGS CHANGE. SHAYNE OLIVER — IT’S ABOUT AUTHORITY. RICK OWENS — YEAH, LIPSTICK IS AN AMAZING THING. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT IT’S ALSO ABOUT THE SECRET. WHAT’S EROTIC IN YOUR FASHION IS IT KEEPS THINGS SECRET. IT’S NEVER OBVIOUS. AND WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT KEEPING THINGS SECRET, I THINK THAT’S IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO VISIBLE TODAY. RICK OWENS — I HAVE TO GO BECAUSE MICHÈLE IS WAITING FOR ME, BUT I THINK WE GOT EVERYTHING RIGHT? WE GOT A DEATH DROP. WE GOT SUNCITY. WE GOT FIST-F CKING… Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA, OWENS BEGAN TO STUDY DESIGN IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE STARTING HIS OWN LABEL IN 1994. HE EVENTUALLY MOVED TO PARIS AND BEGAN SHOWING HIS COLLECTION THERE, MARKING THE START OF THE WORLD&#39;S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS STRIKING AND BRUTALLY MINIMALIST DESIGNS. HIS WORK, PARTICULARLY THE LEATHER JACKETS FOR WHICH HE HAS BECOME BEST KNOWN, HAVE INSPIRED LEGIONS OF CULT-LIKE FOLLOWERS. AND ALONGSIDE HIS PARTNER OF 23 YEARS, MICHELE LAMY, HE HAS CREATED AN AESTHETIC THAT IS IMPRESSIVELY CONSISTENT AND ENDURING. OWENS HIMSELF HAS A FONDNESS FOR SELF-INVENTION, AN IMPULSE THAT FEELS APPROPRIATELY AMERICAN DESPITE HIS COLLECTIONS SHOWING IN PARIS. HERE, HE TALKS ABOUT HIS OWN INVENTIONS, BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY, AND WHERE HE&#39;LL GO FROM THERE. OOO: WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR SUCCESS? RO: YOU TAKE ONE IDEA AND YOU BEAT IT TO THE GROUND UNTIL PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU. YOU HAVE TO HONE IN ON ONE CONCEPT. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE SO MUCH IMAGINATION, AND THEY DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT TO FOCUS ON BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY. THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ME, WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH IMAGINATION BUT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. THAT&#39;S A BLESSING FOR ME— I CAN USUALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT AND WHAT I CAN AIM FOR. PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF IMAGINATION SOMETIMES DON&#39;T HAVE THE PATIENCE OR THE SENSE OF ROUTINE THAT IT TAKES TO REPEAT AN IDEA LONG ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR THEM. I THINK THAT&#39;S WHAT I DID, MAYBE TO A FAULT. I TOOK ONE CONCEPT OR ONE INSPIRATION AND MADE IT MINE BY CLAIMING IT OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER AGAIN, UNTIL PEOPLE DECIDED TO BELIEVE IT. WHY TO A FAULT? BECAUSE ONE DAY, I MIGHT NOT RECOGNIZE WHEN THAT MOMENT IS OVER AND IT&#39;S TIME TO MOVE ON. DO YOU THINK THAT MOMENT WILL COME? I SEE IT HAPPENING TO OTHER DESIGNERS SOMETIMES. I&#39;M NOT GOING TO NAME NAMES, BUT YOU SEE THEY RECOGNIZE THE MOMENT IN SUCH A COMPLETE, RESOLVED WAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, AND NOW THEY&#39;RE STUCK THERE AND HAVEN&#39;T MOVED ON. IN THE &#39;90S OR &#39;80S, THEY WERE BRILLIANT, AND NOW THEY&#39;RE IRRELEVANT. IT&#39;S INEVITABLE. BUT IT DOES CREEP ME OUT. I&#39;M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DAY. WOULD YOU CHANGE, IF YOU RECOGNIZED IT? IF I RECOGNIZED IT, YEAH. THEN I WOULD KEEP ON GOING. WOULD YOU EVER STOP DESIGNING? MY EGO WOULD PROBABLY NEVER ALLOW ME TO. THIS WHOLE THING IS ADDICTIVE. I THINK EVERYBODY&#39;S MOTIVATION IN LIFE IS TO BE LISTENED TO. A PARENT&#39;S MOTIVATION IS TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN LEARN AND LISTEN TO THEM. FOR ROMANCE, YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO WORSHIP YOU AND RESPOND TO YOU. IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT BEING LISTENED TO. I&#39;VE CREATED A WORLD WHERE I&#39;VE SAID THINGS, AND PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED, AND IT&#39;S IRRESISTIBLE. IT&#39;S HUMAN NATURE TO CRAVE IT AND WANT IT. AND IF YOU GET ENOUGH OF IT, BUT IT STARTS FADING AWAY, THAT&#39;S UNCOMFORTABLE. THAT&#39;S WHY I&#39;M FASCINATED BY SOMEONE LIKE MARGIELA OR HELMUT LANG. IS STOPPING [DESIGNING] REALLY WHAT THEY IMAGINED IT TO BE? IT&#39;S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT IT FEELS BETTER. I THINK THE RESPONSE IS TOO ADDICTIVE. WHEN PEOPLE ARE LISTENING, YOU&#39;RE COMMUNICATING WITH THE WORLD AND FULFILLING YOUR POTENTIAL. YOU&#39;RE GUIDING PEOPLE INTO THE MOSH PIT OF THE WORLD, AND IT&#39;S AN ORGY. YOU&#39;RE A STAR OF THE ORGY. WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER THAT? HOW DO YOU CALM DOWN AFTER THAT? OR, IT&#39;S LIKE BEING IN A WAR, AND YOU&#39;RE A GENERAL. THERE&#39;S GLORY, AND EVERYTHING HAS A SENSE OF URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE. AND AFTER THAT, IT MUST SEEM A LITTLE BLAND, YOUR DAY-TO-DAY EXISTENCE. IT&#39;S A WEIRD THING. BUT IT&#39;S NOT LIKE I&#39;M HAVING THIS GLORIOUS MOMENT THAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. MY WHOLE THING IS VERY INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO. ALL I&#39;M SAYING IS, WHEN YOU&#39;RE IN THIS RHYTHM OF CALLING AND RESPONDING, IT&#39;S LOVELY. IT&#39;S ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING THINGS ON THE PLANET, TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY AND BE ENGAGED AND TO START A CONVERSATION. ARE YOU EVER NERVOUS THAT THE CONVERSATION MIGHT BE NEGATIVE? I&#39;M NOT, REALLY, BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT I PUT OUT THERE IS ABOUT LOVE AND AFFECTION AND WARMTH. MAYBE I&#39;M SO OBLIVIOUS THAT I CAN&#39;T IMAGINE WHAT BAD RESPONSE WOULD MATTER, IN CONTRAST TO THAT. WHAT WOULD I ACCEPT THAT WAS NEGATIVE TO THE MOST EARNEST EFFORTS? OF COURSE, I&#39;VE DONE STUFF RIGHT, AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY MY STUFF IS DUMB, BUT I&#39;M GOING TO SAY, &quot;OKAY, BUT I DID MY BEST, AND IT WAS ALL PUT OUT THERE WITH A LOVING SPIRIT. SO IF THAT DOESN&#39;T WORK FOR YOU, I TOTALLY GET IT, BUT IT DOESN&#39;T THREATEN ME.&quot; I&#39;M NOT PUTTING SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT IS WRONG FOR THE WORLD. EVERYTHING I PUT OUT, I FEEL IS A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION. THAT&#39;S WHAT I WANT TO DO. I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE. THAT&#39;S A GREAT ATTITUDE. I HATE TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I&#39;VE GOT ALL THE ANSWERS. BUT I&#39;M 53, SO IT FEELS GOOD TO KNOW MORE THAN I DID WHEN I WAS 22. IT&#39;S NICE TO GET OLDER AND KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU START TO ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR FLAWS, AND YOU DON&#39;T PUNISH YOURSELF ANYMORE FOR BEING NOT PERFECT. IN YOUR STORE IN PARIS, THERE&#39;S A STATUE OF YOU— WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A NARCISSIST? YEAH, I DO. AND I&#39;M VERY BLATANT ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THAT ISN&#39;T REALLY ME. THAT&#39;S AN INVENTION. WHAT I&#39;M SAYING WITH THAT STATUE IS THAT I INVENTED MYSELF, AND SO CAN YOU. ANYBODY ON THE PLANET CAN INVENT HIMSELF OR HERSELF, IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF IMAGINATION, A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE, AND A LOT OF WORK TO BE WHO YOU WANT TO BE. UNDERNEATH ALL THIS, I&#39;M JUST A PEAR-SHAPED PUDGY KID FROM A SMALL TOWN, BUT I CREATED IT. MY HAIR IS GREY AND CURLY RIGHT NOW, AND THE BODY WAS STEROIDS AND WORKING OUT LIKE A FIEND WITH TRAINERS. IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT INDUSTRY. THAT&#39;S WHAT THE STATUE MEANS. IT&#39;S INDUSTRY AND ARTIFICE, AND IT&#39;S BELIEVING IN SOMETHING AND MAKING IT HAPPEN. WHAT ABOUT BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF? WELL, WHAT IS &quot;TRUE TO YOURSELF&quot;? THAT&#39;S WHO I WANTED TO BE. IT IS TRUE TO MYSELF BECAUSE I ACCEPTED WHAT THERE WAS; I WORKED WITH WHAT I HAD AND MADE IT AS GOOD AS IT COULD POSSIBLY BE, IN MY EYES. HOW MUCH MORE TRUE TO YOURSELF CAN YOU BE? I DIDN&#39;T CREATE SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE. I DIDN&#39;T AIM TOO HIGH. [LAUGHS) BUT THAT&#39;S WHAT THAT STATUE IS SAYING. IT&#39;S ALSO SAYING THAT WHEN YOU COME TO THE STORE, THIS ISN&#39;T A COMMITTEE DECISION. THIS ISN&#39;T A GROUP OF DESIGNERS. THIS IS ONE PERSON&#39;S OEUVRE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE. YOU&#39;VE SAID BEFORE THAT YOUR SHOWS ARE NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU; IT&#39;S MORE ABOUT HAVING PEOPLE BUY YOUR CLOTHES. WHEN I STARTED OUT, IT WASN&#39;T REALLY SHOW— OR PRESS— ORIENTED. IT WAS ABOUT ME TAKING A BAG OF CLOTHES TO THE BACK OFFICES OF STORES, AND TALKING WITH THE BUYERS AND SELLING CLOTHES AND LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE WERE RESPONDING TO. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE THAT WAS MORE HARDCORE AND TRUE. IT WAS REAL. RUNWAY SHOWS AND PRESS— IT&#39;S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL. IT&#39;S LIKE THE KIDS WHO HAD ALL THE RIGHT CLOTHES IN HIGH SCHOOL. HOW DID YOU DRESS IN HIGH SCHOOL? I HAD A ROD STEWART HAIRCUT— HE WAS BIG, THEN— AND PROBABLY A KISS T-SHIRT. I WOULDN&#39;T WEAR SHOES MOST OF THE TIME, BECAUSE NOT WEARING SHOES WAS REALLY COOL. IT WAS A HIPPIE, POT-SMOKING THING. YOU&#39;VE SPOKEN ABOUT YOUR AESTHETIC BEING &quot;BROKEN IDEALISM.&quot; I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THAT FURTHER. I LOVE THE IDEA OF MAKING YOURSELF BETTER, OF IMPROVEMENT, OF GETTING TO SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL LEVEL OF TRANSCENDENCE. BUT I THINK YOU NEVER REALLY GET THERE; LIFE IS A PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET THERE, AND YOU NEVER REALLY DO. THERE ARE MOMENTS OF IT, THERE ARE GLIMMERS OF IT, AND THAT&#39;S WHAT MOVES US FORWARD. THIS IDEA OF PURE TRANSCENDENCE IS SUCH A GREAT ONE, BUT IT&#39;S ALWAYS JUST OUT OF REACH. THERE&#39;S SOMETHING KIND OF POIGNANT AND LOVELY AND MELANCHOLY ABOUT JUST ACCEPTING THE GLORY OF THE EFFORT AS GLORY ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. IT&#39;S WHAT I RESPOND TO THE MOST. IS THAT WHY THE COLOR BLACK IS SO PREVALENT? WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT, I WAS VERY ANTI-BLACK. THERE WAS SOME BLACK FOR PUNCTUATION, BUT I WAS REALLY PROMOTING GREY. I HAD BEEN WEARING GREY THROUGH YOUNG ADULTHOOD. BLACK IS ABOUT INSECURITY; IT&#39;S ABOUT AGGRESSION; IT&#39;S ABOUT TRYING TO PRESENT A FIERCE EXTERIOR WHEN YOU&#39;RE INSECURE UNDERNEATH IT. IT&#39;S ADOLESCENT AND MELODRAMATIC. I THOUGHT, &quot;I&#39;M GOING TO DO GREY.&quot; GREY IS ABOUT SOFTNESS. THERE CAN BE A WARMTH TO IT. THERE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OF MELANCHOLY THERE, BUT IT&#39;S ALSO ABOUT RESTRAINT AND DISCRETION AND, MAYBE, NOT PUTTING YOURSELF FIRST. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GENTLE EXPRESSION. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST MORE ELEGANT, AND I STILL DO. MOST OF MY INTERIORS ARE GREY. MY BEDROOM IS GREY. MY PACKAGING FOR EVERYTHING IS GREY. BUT IN THIS WORLD, GREY SOMETIMES GETS A LITTLE DIRTY AND WASHED OUT AND SAD. IN A VERY BUSY WORLD WITH A LOT OF MESSINESS, BLACK TO ME NOW IS MORE ABOUT TIDINESS. IT CREATES A NICE LINE. WHEN YOU SEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WEARING BLACK, MAYBE IT&#39;S NOT AS NICE. BUT WHEN YOU SEE ONE PERSON IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING WEARING BLACK, THERE&#39;S SOMETHING VERY NICE ABOUT THE PUNCTUATION OF THE BLACK LINE, AND IT CREATES A VERY NICE PEDESTAL FOR THE HEAD. THAT&#39;S WHY I DO MONOCHROMATIC OUTFITS SO OFTEN, BECAUSE THERE&#39;S SOMETHING NICE ABOUT MAKING AN UNFUSSY PEDESTAL FOR A HEAD. I FEEL LIKE GENDER IDENTITY IS A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION NOW, MORE THAN EVER, AND IT&#39;S ALSO SOMETHING THAT YOU&#39;VE ADDRESSED QUITE A BIT. I&#39;M WONDERING HOW YOU DEFINE THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I CAN, AND I CERTAINLY AM NOT QUALIFIED TO. I JUST NATURALLY DON&#39;T RECOGNIZE IT, AND THAT&#39;S WHY MY GENDERS BLUR SO MUCH. HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND YOUR WIFE BEEN TOGETHER? WHAT ROLE DOES SHE PLAY IN YOUR LIFE? TWENTY-THREE YEARS. MICHELE HUMANIZES ME, AND SHE CONNECTS ME WITH THE WORLD IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAT I WOULD ON MY OWN. I WOULD LOOK AT EVERYTHING BEHIND GLASS BY MYSELF WITHOUT HER. SHE ENGAGES ME AND INVOLVES ME IN THE WORLD MORE AND CREATES A FAMILY AROUND ME. WHERE I LOCK THE DOOR AND SHUT EVERYONE OUT, SHE INVITES THEM IN. SO IT&#39;S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE. [LAUGHS] BUT ONE THAT I KNOW I CREATED FOR MYSELF OUT OF SOME GREAT INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION... SHE&#39;S AN INCREDIBLE HANDFUL. I&#39;VE NEVER MET ANYONE AS POTENT, SO I THINK I&#39;M VERY LUCKY. DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE IDEA OF A SOULMATE? I THINK SO. I ALSO THINK EVERYONE ENDS UP WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. IF YOU&#39;RE MISERABLE, YOU WANT TO BE THERE BECAUSE YOU ENJOY THE DRAMA. LIKE I SAID, PEOPLE CAN REALLY PLACE THEMSELVES WHERE THEY BELONG AND WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. I&#39;M SURE THERE&#39;S A VERY CYNICAL, CALCULATING PART OF MY HEAD THAT KNOWS WHAT CAN WORK. I&#39;M SURE THERE&#39;S AN ELEMENT OF THAT IN ALL RELATIONSHIPS. YOUR SHOWS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF PARTICULAR BECAUSE YOU GET A CERTAIN TYPE OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. THEY ALL WEAR YOUR DESIGNS, AND IT&#39;S LIKE A RICK OWENS TRIBE. I&#39;M WONDERING IF THAT&#39;S SOMETHING YOU&#39;RE PROUD OF, IF IT&#39;S SOMETHING YOU LOOK TO. YOU CAN&#39;T HELP BUT BE AFFECTED BY THAT. IT&#39;S VALIDATING, AND I FEEL VERY PATERNAL ABOUT IT. IT&#39;S VERY MOVING TO HAVE PEOPLE CONNECT WITH YOU THAT WAY. I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW RESPONSIBLE I REALLY AM FOR IT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT I DO OR WHAT I&#39;VE MADE, ALL I&#39;VE DONE IS ARRANGED REFERENCES OR MADE COMPOSITIONS THAT A LOT OF US RECOGNIZE. I&#39;VE MADE A HAIKU ABOUT REFERENCE POINTS THAT WE CAN ALL CONNECT WITH AND CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYBODY CAN CELEBRATE IT. I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW MAGICAL THAT REALLY IS. IT&#39;S NOT LIKE I INVENTED IT, BUT I CREATED A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND TALK ABOUT IT. GROWING UP, I PROBABLY DIDN&#39;T DEVELOP CERTAIN SOCIAL SKILLS AND OVER­COMPENSATED BY DRINKING AND DOING DRUGS TOO MUCH TO FEEL COMFORTABLE, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO. BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO GET INVOLVED, EVEN IF IT MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE. I WAS DETERMINED TO BE PART OF THE WORLD SOMEHOW, SO I FORCED MYSELF TO DO THAT. I&#39;M SURE I WAS INCREDIBLY AWKWARD AND SILLY, BUT I PARTICIPATED. I GOT INTO THE MOSH PIT. I THINK I&#39;M IN THE MOSH PIT NOW. I FEEL LIKE I&#39;M BODYSURFING ON AN AUDIENCE IN THE LOVELIEST WAY. I FEEL LIKE I&#39;M TOUCHING PEOPLE AND I&#39;M ENGAGED AND CONNECTED. WHAT WAS IT LIKE LIVING IN LA? IT WAS FUN BEING A YOUNG ADULT IN LOS ANGELES. I&#39;LL GO BACK AT SOME POINT. I HAVEN&#39;T BEEN BACK IN 14 YEARS, BUT IT IS A WONDERFUL PLACE. I DON&#39;T LIKE NEW YORK. IT&#39;S LIKE A VIP ROOM. THE COUNTRY IS SO BIG, AND EVERY­BODY IS TRYING TO CRAM THEMSELVES INTO THIS TINY VIP ROOM. AND LOS ANGELES IS OPEN, AND IT&#39;S BEAUTIFUL AND IT&#39;S PRETTY. BUT IT&#39;S ALSO BECOMING THE NEW VIP ROOM. I HAVEN&#39;T BEEN BACK IN SO LONG, BUT I&#39;VE HEARD THAT EVERYONE CLEVER IS GOING THERE. DO YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE? THE PLAN IS JUST TO MAKE STUFF, EXPRESS YOURSELF, AND CREATE SOMETHING, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. THE BEST LESSON I EVER LEARNED FROM MY DAD WAS TO HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT PLAN FOR THE WORST. IT WAS REALLY ABOUT FULFILLING YOUR CREATIVE DESTINY, COME HELL OR HIGH WATER. TRY TO MAKE IT TRUE AND HONEST, AND DON&#39;T BE AFRAID OF BEING POOR IF THAT&#39;S WHAT IT TAKES.

THE INEFFABILITY OF HIS WORK HAS NOT PREVENTED OTHERS FROM TRYING TO COPY IT. THE NEW YORK TIMES ONCE CALLED OWENS “FASHION’S MOST IMITATED DESIGNER.” HIS CLOTHES—ESPECIALLY HIS ASYMMETRICAL T-SHIRTS AND ANGULAR LEATHER JACKETS DISTRESSED TO THE POINT THAT THEY FEEL LIKE AN EXPENSIVELY LIVED-IN SECOND SKIN—ARE ECHOED IN EVERY RUNG OF FASHION, FROM HAUTE COUTURE TO HIGH STREET. BUT OWENS HAS MANAGED ALWAYS TO STAY A STEP AHEAD OF HIS COPYISTS. TODAY HIS PRIVATELY HELD BUSINESS—AN OUTRÉ EMPIRE TRADING IN EVERYTHING FROM JEANS TO MINK STOLES TO FURNITURE MADE OF 500,000-YEAR-OLD FOSSILIZED BARK—IS REPUTED TO BE WORTH UPWARDS OF $100 MILLION. OWENS BEGAN HIS FASHION CAREER IN THE 1990S, HAND-STITCHING JACKETS AND SELLING THEM HIMSELF TO STORE BUYERS IN THEIR OFFICES. COURTNEY LOVE AND A FEW OTHER CELEBRITIES WERE PHOTOGRAPHED WEARING HIS DESIGNS, STARTING A BUZZ THAT QUICKLY TURNED INTO A SENSATION. IN 2002, VOGUE INVITED HIM TO DO A RUNWAY SHOW IN NEW YORK, LAUNCHING HIS CAREER. HE MOVED TO PARIS IN 2003, AND EVER SINCE HE HAS CULTIVATED AN EXCEEDINGLY ECCENTRIC EXISTENCE WITH HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, A WIZENED, GOLD-TOOTHED FRENCHWOMAN WITH SORCERESS AIRS, WHOM HE CALLS HIS MUSE AND WHO LEADS THE FURNITURE, FINE JEWELRY, AND FUR SIDES OF HIS BUSINESS. DESPITE HIS HARD-EDGED APPEARANCE, OWENS, 52, IS EXCEEDINGLY KIND IN PERSON AND DISARMINGLY ELOQUENT FOR A FASHION DESIGNER. HE AVOIDS EYE CONTACT WHEN SPEAKING, AS IF READING ALOUD FROM INVISIBLE TELEPROMPTER. THIS COULD BE A KIND OF VESTIGIAL SHYNESS. HE GREW UP IN A CONSERVATIVE YET BOOKISH FAMILY IN A SUBURB OF LOS ANGELES. “I HAD A VERY BULLIED CHILDHOOD. I WAS CALLED ‘FAGGOT’ AND ‘WEIRD.’ I WAS PASSIVE, MILD, VERY QUIET, EFFEMINATE, DELICATE,” HE SAYS. “SO I HAD TO TOUGHEN UP.” SURFACE SAT DOWN WITH OWENS IN THE GARDEN PATIO OF HIS FIVE-STORY MANSION IN PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON, A BUILDING IN ONE OF THE SNOOTIER PARTS OF THE RIVE GAUCHE THAT WAS ONCE THE HEADQUARTERS OF FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY LEADERS LIKE FRANÇOIS MITTERRAND. IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY RENOVATED INTO A KIND OF EVIL-GENIUS LAIR, COMPLETE WITH A FUR ATELIER CONTAINING THE PELTS OF A VAST ARRAY OF EXOTIC MAMMALS. OWENS HAD RECENTLY HELD HIS SPRING MEN’S SHOW, AND WE BEGAN OUR CONVERSATION DISCUSSING A MINOR SCANDAL THAT SURROUNDED IT. A GERMAN MODEL KNOWN AS JERA PULLED A STUNT, UNFURLING A BANNER THAT READ “PLEASE KILL ANGELA MERKEL—NOT.” OWENS IS KNOWN FOR HIS RUNWAY PROVOCATIONS, BUT THIS ONE HE DIDN’T SANCTION AND WAS FURIOUS ABOUT, APPARENTLY PUNCHING THE MODEL WHEN HE WALKED BACKSTAGE, AND THEN EMPHASIZING THE POINT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH WWD: “PLEASE SAY THAT I PUNCHED HIM.” WHY DID YOU REACT SO INTENSELY TO THE GUERILLA PROTEST AT YOUR LAST MEN’S SHOW? I WAS PISSED AT THAT MOMENT. I THOUGHT, “HEY, THIS IS MY SPOTLIGHT, AND YOU F CKED IT UP.” THE WHOLE REASON I HIT THE GUY WAS I KNEW IF I DIDN’T REACT VERY STRONGLY IT MIGHT GET OUT THAT THIS WAS SOME STUNT THAT I HAD PLANNED. EVERYBODY HAD TO KNOW HOW STRONGLY I DISAGREED WITH THIS. I DON’T MIND DRAMA, BUT I DON’T LIKE DEATH THREATS. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE MODEL WHO HELD THE SIGN? NO, AND I WON’T. I WONDER IF HE HAS DEMENTIA OR SOMETHING. HE’S ALWAYS BEEN A HEAVY DRINKER, AND A LITTLE ERRATIC, WHICH WAS ADORABLE. BUT WHAT HE DID WAS JUST SO ILLOGICAL. HE WAS VERY ACCEPTED HERE AND EMBRACED BY A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY AFFECTIONATE TOWARD HIM—A GROUP THAT NOW FEELS MORE HOSTILITY TOWARD HIM THAN I DO BECAUSE THEY FEEL PROTECTIVE OF ME. IT WAS REALLY A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE GESTURE. THIS PROTEST WAS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE OTHER PROVOCATIONS AT YOUR RUNWAY SHOWS BECAUSE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR VISION. THAT WAS MY BIGGEST PROBLEM— THAT IT WAS A NEGATIVE GESTURE. WHENEVER I DO PROVOCATION, I’M ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING THAT I FEEL IS BASED ON WARMTH AND KINDNESS AND LOVE. EVEN WHEN YOU SEND OUT MODELS WEARING TUNICS EXPOSING THEIR PENISES? EVEN WHEN I DO THE PENISES. THAT WAS REALLY ABOUT: LET’S CONSIDER A WORLD WHERE THERE’S NO SHAME. WHY DID YOUR PARENTS TEACH YOU THAT YOUR PENIS IS UGLY? ALL THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OR VEHEMENT REACTIONS WERE: “HOW DISGUSTING! WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO SHOW A SHRIVELED UP NUTSACK LIKE THAT?” AND: “WHY WAS IT SO SMALL?” IT WAS AMAZING THAT THE SECOND THING WAS WHY WAS IT SO SMALL? LIKE, WHO TAUGHT YOU AS A CHILD THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BIGGER? AND THAT IT WAS UGLY? YOU’VE ALSO CHALLENGED THE FASHION STATUS QUO IN TERMS OF RACE AND BODY SIZE, REPLACING RUNWAY MODELS IN ONE OF YOUR RECENT WOMEN’S COLLECTIONS WITH MOSTLY BLACK, PLUS-SIZE MEMBERS OF A STEP-DANCE TEAM. THAT WAS JUST GLORIOUS! IT TOUCHED THAT NEED FOR UNITY THAT WE ALL FEEL DEEP INSIDE. AND ALSO SHOWED THAT WE DON’T ACCEPT A RIGID IDEA OF BEAUTY. WHEN THOSE WOMEN WERE ON THE RUNWAY DOING WHAT THEY DID, THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY CONVINCING. THEY BELONGED THERE. AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN’T LOOK RIDICULOUS. MAYBE SEEING THAT, OTHER WOMEN WOULD SAY TO THEMSELVES, “IF I HAD CONFIDENCE, IF I FIXED MYSELF UP A LITTLE BIT, AND IF I WORE A RICK OWENS OUTFIT, I WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL, TOO…” [LAUGHS] I DON’T MEAN THAT LAST PART ABOUT MY OUTFIT. DO YOU LIKE TALKING ABOUT YOUR WORK? I’M AFRAID I DO TOO MUCH. I’M HORRIFIED THAT I MIGHT SEEM LIKE SOMEONE WHO LOVES THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE. AND THE OTHER THING I HATE IS I ALWAYS SOUND OPINIONATED, LIKE I KNOW EVERYTHING. I ALWAYS WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT I CAN BE COMPLETELY HYPOCRITICAL. I CAN SAY SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTRADICT SOMETHING I SAID A YEAR AGO. HOW DO YOU DESIGN YOUR COLLECTIONS? THE COLLECTIONS ARE A ROLLING PROCESS THAT BEGINS WITH NOTES THAT I WRITE FOR MYSELF AT THE GYM EVERY DAY. I DON’T DO SKETCHES, REALLY. THE NOTES WILL JUST BE A FEW WORDS, LIKE “EXPLODING PYRAMID.” AND I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHAT SILHOUETTE THAT LOOKS LIKE. SO THERE’S JUST AN ACCUMULATION OF LISTS AND LISTS AND LISTS. AND WHEN IT COMES TIME TO GET TO THE FACTORY, I LOOK AT THE LISTS AND PICK OUT THE STUFF THAT SOUNDS RIGHT AND JUST MAKE MY COMPOSITION THERE. WHOM DO YOU DESIGN FOR? ME. THE ONLY WAY THIS THING STAYS PURE IS IF I ISOLATE WHAT I REALLY LIKE AND WHAT IS A PERSONAL EXPRESSION. AS SOON AS I START CONSIDERING OTHER PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY MIGHT LIKE, I KIND OF GET LOST. I’M PROUD OF THIS, AND I’M ASHAMED OF IT AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MEN WHO WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN AN ASYMMETRICAL COLLAR OR A DROP-CROTCH PANT? I’D SAY WEAR SOMETHING ELSE. MAYBE FASHION ISN’T YOUR THING—WHO CARES? I REALIZE IT’S A NICHE. NOT EVERYBODY’S INTERESTED IN IT, NOT EVERYBODY HAS TO BE. AND I’M NOT SAYING THAT LIKE I’M DISMISSING PEOPLE. I’M SAYING, “STUFF THAT FITS INTO MY WORLD MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE IN YOUR WORLD. BUT THE STUFF THAT I MAKE WORKS PERFECTLY FOR MY WORLD.” WHAT MAKES YOU WANT TO GO ON DESIGNING? I WONDER SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES I THINK IT’S JUST VANITY. WHY DO I INSIST ON BEING LISTENED TO? BUT I THINK IT’S THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE LISTENED TO. I THINK IT’S ONE OF OUR MAIN UNIVERSAL MOTIVATIONS. AND HAVING A CONVERSATION—THAT’S WHAT CONNECTS YOU TO THE WORLD. I SAY SOME THINGS, PEOPLE RESPOND, I LISTEN, AND THEN RESPOND AGAIN. THIS CONVERSATION IS KIND OF ADDICTIVE. I LOVE FEELING LIKE I’VE THROWN MYSELF INTO THIS MOSH PIT AND I’M ENGAGED AND I’M RUBBING SWEATY SHOULDERS WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I’M CONNECTING. I KNOW THAT THAT’S A LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS. I DO ALL THE TALKING AND PEOPLE RESPOND BY BUYING THINGS. BUT IT’S STILL A CONVERSATION. WHY DID YOU MOVE TO PARIS FROM L.A.? I WORK IN EUROPE. THAT’S WHERE THE FACTORIES ARE, THAT’S WHERE FASHION IS. I TRIED TO DO IT FROM L.A. BUT I WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH CONSTANTLY, AND I NEED TO LIVE WHERE I WORK. I HEAR YOU STILL STRUGGLE WITH FRENCH? NO, I DON’T. I JUST GAVE UP. I JUST DECIDED THAT IT WAS EXOTIC NOT TO SPEAK FRENCH. IT KEEPS IT ROMANTIC, A LITTLE BIT HAZY. I’M A LITTLE WARY OF PARIS. I’M JUDGED IN PARIS. I HAVE TO PERFORM IN PARIS. I MIGHT LOVE IT MORE THAN IT LOVES ME. IT’S NOT AS WARM AND COZY AS OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD. I LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF CHILL, OF FORMALITY. BUT WHEN I GO TO LONDON, I PRACTICALLY KISS TAXI DRIVERS BECAUSE THEY’RE SO SWEET. YOU’RE ABOUT TO OPEN A STORE IN LOS ANGELES, WHERE YOU BEGAN YOUR CAREER. HOW DOES IT FEEL? I THINK MAYBE I’M SUPPRESSING EMOTIONS BECAUSE I DON’T HAVE MANY FEELINGS ABOUT IT. I’M NOT THERE, AND I’M NOT GOING TO GO. I’LL PROBABLY GO IN A YEAR AFTER IT’S SETTLED IN, BUT I WOULD FEEL KIND OF OBNOXIOUS GOING LIKE THIS IS SOME KIND OF CLEOPATRA’S BARGE. IT’S NO ACCIDENT THAT YOU’RE OPENING UP IN LA BREA. I HAVE AFFECTION FOR THAT AREA. IT’S CLOSE TO HOLLYWOOD, WHERE I LIVED. BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT GOING BACK. I HAVEN’T BEEN THERE FOR 14 YEARS. I WAS VERY MESSY IN LOS ANGELES—FALLING APART EVERYWHERE. I HAVE UNPLEASANT MEMORIES OF BEING A DRUNKEN SLOB. THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT MAKES ME CRINGE A LITTLE BIT. STILL, YOU’VE TAKEN GREAT CARE IN TERMS OF THE DESIGN OF THE STORE. IN YOUR NOTES ABOUT IT, YOU MENTIONED HOW IT’S AN HOMAGE TO CECILE B. DEMILLE, COMPLETE WITH A SPECIAL GLASS WALL THAT RELEASES AN “EJACULATION OF FOG” EVERY FIVE MINUTES. AH YES, MY GIDDY LITTLE NOTES. I WRITE ALL MY OWN PRESS RELEASES. SOMETIMES I FORGET HOW UNUSUAL THAT PROBABLY IS. NOBODY DOES THAT. I REALIZE THAT’S ONE OF OUR ASSETS: THE FACT THAT IT’S A REAL PERSONAL EXPRESSION. WE DON’T DO COMMITTEE THINGS AND WE DON’T HAVE PR PEOPLE THAT ARE KIND OF CREATING THIS FALSE ILLUSION. EVERYTHING IS REALLY AUTHENTICALLY TRUE. I JUST SPOUT OFF ANYTHING THAT COMES INTO MY HEAD. I FORGET SOMETIMES HOW UPTIGHT THE WORLD CAN BE. YOUR STORE IS LOCATED DOWN THE STREET FROM THE PLAZA SALON, A MEXICAN DRAG BAR WHERE YOU APPARENTLY SPENT SOME INTERESTING EVENINGS. WHAT WAS IT LIKE? OH, IT WAS JUST A MEXICAN DRAG BAR. IT’S IN THE MIDDLE OF LA BREA, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE IN TIJUANA. IT WAS JUST RAUCOUS FUN. MICHÈLE HAD A RESTAURANT UP THE STREET. SOMETIMES, AFTER IT CLOSED, WE’D GO HAVE A LAST DRINK AND A DANCE. ONE WEEKNIGHT, THE PLACE WAS EMPTY, WE’RE ON THE DANCE FLOOR, AND THERE WAS THIS SHRIVELED UP LITTLE GUY, AND IT WAS IGGY POP. AND THAT’S THE ONLY TIME I EVER MET IGGY POP. HE WAS DANCING WITH SOME ASIAN GIRL, AND I WAS DANCING WITH MICHÈLE. I SAID SOMETHING TO HIM LIKE, “HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU.” AND THAT WAS IT. AN UNDERSTATED REACTION TO ONE OF YOUR PERSONAL HEROES. YOU WERE TOO COOL TO PLAY FANBOY? NO, I WAS TOO DRUNK. I DIDN’T WANT TO SAY SOMETHING TOO STUPID. WHAT ROLE DOES YOUR MICHÈLE PLAY CREATIVELY FOR YOU? SHE HAS A VERY STRONG PERSONALITY. WE BUTT HEADS WHEN WE WORK TOO CLOSELY TOGETHER. AND IT BECOMES PERSONAL. HER EMOTIONS ARE MORE ON THE SURFACE THAN MINE ARE, AND I TAKE HER EMOTIONS TOO SERIOUSLY AND GET DISTRACTED BY THAT. I GET KIND OF SENSITIVE, AND I GET A LITTLE TENSE AND THAT MAKES HER TENSE. WE BOTH TOTALLY RECOGNIZE IT. WE CAN OBJECTIVELY SEE WHAT’S HAPPENING BUT SOMEHOW KEEP REPEATING IT. SO YOU DON’T WORK TOGETHER TOO CLOSELY? WE’VE LEARNED HOW TO COMPARTMENTALIZE. WE FOUND HOW TO DEFINE OUR AREAS. IT HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME, AND WE HAVEN’T PERFECTED IT. THERE’S A WORLD I CALL “LAMYLAND” THAT I’M NOT ALLOWED INTO, OR THAT I DON’T TRY TO TRESPASS ON. I DON’T UNDERSTAND HER COMPLETELY. SHE’S MERCURIAL AND UNPREDICTABLE. BUT THAT’S HER CREATIVITY. YOUR COMPANY IS ALREADY WORTH UPWARD OF $100 MILLION. DO YOU FEEL PRESSURE TO KEEP PERFORMING AND GROWING FINANCIALLY? WE GOT SO FAR BEYOND WHERE I EVER THOUGHT WE WOULD BE. IF THIS FALLS APART TOMORROW, I STILL WON. I’M NOT REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT. AND YOU KNOW I’VE INVESTED ENOUGH SO THAT IF EVERYTHING FALLS APART I’M GOING TO BE OKAY. BUT I’M VERY CONSCIOUS WHEN I SEE DESIGNERS WHO HAD A MOMENT WHERE THEY WERE SO RELEVANT AND THEY MADE SENSE FOR THE MOMENT AND THEN THEY JUST STAY THERE AND THEY DON’T MOVE ON. IT JUST FREAKS ME THE F CK OUT. THE IDEA THAT IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU? I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE IT’S ALMOST INEVITABLE. I DO SEE SOME DESIGNERS THAT LAST AND MAINTAIN THEIR VISION. BUT WHEN I SEE STUFF OUT ON THE STREET THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT I’M DOING, I THINK THERE’S GOT TO BE A BACKLASH COMING. I DON’T KNOW WHEN IT’S COMING, OR IF IT’S HAPPENING RIGHT THIS MINUTE. BUT I THINK I’M SUCH A PRIME TARGET FOR THAT. IS THAT A CREATIVE CONCERN OR A BUSINESS CONCERN? THESE DAYS, DO YOU FEEL MORE LIKE A MERCHANT OR AN ARTIST? I KIND OF FEEL LIKE BOTH. I HESITATE TO SAY “ARTIST.” THE ART WORLD DOESN’T HAVE THE SAME MYSTIQUE IT DID WHEN I WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. WHEN I WAS LEARNING ABOUT ART, GOING TO ART SCHOOL, IT SEEMED REALLY COMPLICATED AND INTELLECTUALLY RIGOROUS. THERE WAS ABSTRACT THEORY AND ALL OF THIS STUFF I JUST COULDN’T FOLLOW. WHEN I GOT OLDER, I REALIZED THAT’S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE ART OR EXPRESS YOURSELF. NOW I WONDER IF FASHION HAS KIND OF MET ART OR SURPASSED ART. IT CAN PUSH A LOT OF THE SAME BUTTONS. THE OTHER THING IS, I’M ABLE TO MAKE A MORE PROFOUND DIFFERENCE THAN HAVING SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL THAT’S HANGING ON A WALL. I’M TOUCHING PEOPLE EVERY DAY. THE IDEA THAT I’VE DONE MY TINY BIT TO EXOTICIZE THAT, OR MAKE IT MORE THEATRICAL, AND IT SPREAD— THAT’S HARDCORE.

MEET THE FLAMBOYANT AMERICAN DESIGNER LIVING IN PARIS. 11 O’CLOCK, LATE JUNE, A PARTICULARLY PARISIAN HQ-WORKSHOP-RESIDENCE, TWO STEPS FROM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. RICK OWENS APPEARS STRAIGHT OUT OF ONE OF HIS SHOWS. A HIERATIC CREATURE WORTHY OF A SUSPENSE NOVEL, HE IS WEARING A BLACK TANK TOP, BLACK SPORTY HAREM PANTS AND BLACK HIGH TOP SNEAKERS. TAPERED SILHOUETTE, GOTHIC-WARRIOR LOOK, MUSCULAR, BRONZED METAL PROFILE WITH AQUILINE NOSE AND HIGH CHEEKBONES, COAL-COLORED LONG HAIR, THE GLOBAL ALLURE OF AN APACHE CHIEF “A LA” IGGY POP. IT COULD BE ALMOST ANECDOTAL, SINCE THE WORLD OF FASHION IS FULL OF CHARACTERS IN THEIR ARMOR-OUTFITS, REDONE OR COUNTERFEIT, REINVENTED, WHO TELL OTHER LIVES AS THEIRS - BECAUSE YES, IT IS HARD TO JUST SETTLE ON YOURSELF. IN THIS CASE, A REAL SYMBIOSIS HAS OCCURRED, WITH AN ALLURING RETALIATION. RICK OWENS, BORN AS RICHARD SATURNINO OWENS FIFTY-TWO YEARS AGO IN LOS ANGELES, GREW UP HALFWAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO, IN PORTERVILLE, A BLOODY AND BIGOTED ENVIRONMENT, AND TELLS A STORY OF A SADISTIC AND ISOLATED CHILDHOOD THAT TURNED HIM INTO A LORD OF THE PARADOXICAL WAR: PACIFIST, AND HERALD OF &quot;THE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY&quot;, BUT PROVIDER OF POWERFUL, HYPNOTIZING SHOWS, ACCOMPANIED BY HEAVY BASS SOUND, FROM WHICH A HYBRID FEMALE AND MALE HUMANITY EMERGES, RAW AND SOPHISTICATED, ROUGH AND LYRICAL, ORGANIC AND SPIRITUAL, PREHISTORIC AND FUTURISTIC, UNDERGROUND AND LUXURIOUS – ALL AT THE SAME TIME. WITH RICK OWENS, FASHION WEEK LEANS TOWARDS “MAD MAX”, RATHER THAN THE “BATHING BEAUTY”, AND THE MODEL BATTALION LOOKS MORE LIKE THE HORDE OR THE GANG, RATHER THAN THE PROM DEBUTANTS. THE RESULT: THE BUZZ IS AT A RECORD RATE. A LIVE SET OF A METAL BAND WINNY PUHH IN JUNE 2013 (OWENS IS ALSO KEEN ON CLASSICAL MUSIC, FAN OF MONTSERRAT CABALLÉ IN PARTICULAR). IMPETUOUS (AND IMPOSING) AMERICAN STEP DANCERS, THE FOLLOWING SEPTEMBER. MEN WITH THEIR PENISES IN PLAIN VIEW, IN JANUARY 2015. ANYTHING, THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THIS EPIPHENOMENON, IF NOT ALL, WAS BASED ON A CONSISTENT AND UPSCALE PRODUCTION: WITH A CULT FOLLOWING FOR A GOOD DOZEN YEARS, THE RICK OWENS LABEL CAN NOW BOAST A BIG SUCCESS WITH THE PUBLIC - DESPITE A LACK OF PUBLICITY AND REMAINING OUT OF REACH FOR THE STOCK MARKET, NO MATTER WHAT THE PRICE IS. AN IMPORTANT DETAIL: THE PRUDENT OWENSCORP (EIGHT FLAGSHIP BOUTIQUES IN PARIS, LONDON, MILAN, NEW YORK, MIAMI, SEOUL, HONG KONG AND TOKYO) REMAINS INDEPENDENT. RICK OWENS AND HIS BAROQUE MUSE-ACCOMPLICE-PARTNER MICHÈLE LAMY (SEE PAGE 44) - ARE OWNERS OF THE 80% OF THE COMPANY, SUPPORTED SINCE 2001 BY EO BOCCI ASSOCIATI GROUP. THE CALIFORNIAN IS BASED IN PARIS, BUT MANUFACTURES HIS COLLECTIONS IN ITALY. HIS WORK WITH TEXTILES HAS NOTORIETY. STARTING WITH LEATHER, WASHED, BOILED, BRUSHED... THE PERFECT RICK OWENS: THE FLEXIBILITY, THE DROP, AND THE ULTRA LONG SLEEVES - NO, HIS SUPPORTERS SAY, GOD COULDN’T FIND ANYTHING BETTER TO ACCOMPANY HIS SHOWS THAN THE TOTAL GLAM-GOTH-ROCK FASHION ZOMBIE-CULT LOOK. RICK OWENS, WHO STARTED IN FASHION BY PATRONAGE, AFTER SHORT DESIGN STUDIES IN LA, CULTIVATED A TASTE FOR DRAPERY, ASYMMETRY, TRANSPARENCY, VOLUME AND RUSHED LENGTHS, EXAGGERATED AND OUTRAGED. THE INFLUENCE OF STREETWEAR, WHERE HE CUT HIS TEETH, IS CLEAR BUT SERVES AS A MERE SPRINGBOARD FOR HIS THEATRICS. OWENS MAINTAINS, NOURISHES, AND PAMPERS A DARK FLAMBOYANCE (BLACK PREVAILS, WITH BREAKTHROUGHS OF WHITE, GRAY, TAUPE AND BRONZE) AT A TIME WHEN THE LOW PROFILE NORMCORE TREND IS EARNING ITS PLACE ON THE PODIUM. THE CONSUBSTANTIAL NONCONFORMIST THAT HE IS, HE SAYS, AND THE IRREPROACHABLE URBANISM, MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ANTICIPATE SOME SELF-SATISFACTION FROM A MAN WHO LIKES THE FULL-SIZE STATUES OF HIMSELF IN WAX. &quot;NONCONFORMIST&quot;: DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF IN THIS ADJECTIVE? ABSOLUTELY. ANYWAY, I WAS, TWENTY YEARS AGO. I AM OLD NOW, 52 YEARS OLD, AND I AM PART OF THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT. THE NEW GENERATION ARRIVES, WHICH WILL UNDOUBTEDLY STAND AGAINST ME, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT I BELONG TO THE PAST, TO THE GENERATION OF THEIR PARENTS, WHICH IS TRUE. AND THE PARENTS ARE ALWAYS EMBARRASSING. YOUR SHOWS ARE NONCONFORMIST. I SEE THEM AS A TRIBUTE TO A CERTAIN TYPE OF HUMANITY AND LOVE ITSELF. THAT&#39;S WHY I ALWAYS CAST SPECIFIC REAL PEOPLE FOR MY SHOWS, NOT BEAUTIFUL BY CONVENTIONAL FASHION STANDARDS: TO SHOW THAT BEAUTY IS ALSO A STORY OF SELF-CONFIDENCE, ATTITUDE, AND IT CAN WORK. EVERY DAY I FIND A REASON TO HATE MYSELF. I THINK, &quot;ASSHOLE, WHY HAVE YOU ACTED LIKE THAT? &quot; AND THEN I SAY TO MYSELF, &quot;OKAY, YOU ACTED LIKE AN ASSHOLE, BUT FORGIVE YOURSELF, BECAUSE ANYWAY, NOBODY CARES, SO WHY ARE YOU CONCEITED ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION TO YOUR ACTIONS?&quot; AND I AM CONVINCED THAT IF WE ARE NOT BORN EQUAL, WE ALL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL. IN JUNE, AFTER YOUR MENSWEAR SHOW, YOU HIT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE MODELS, WHO HAD BRANDISHED A MESSAGE CONCERNING ANGELA MERKEL ON THE RUNWAY. WE ALL EXPECT FOR A SHOW TO SURPRISE US, AND I MYSELF LOVE THE GLORIOUS FEAST. BUT IT WAS A DEATH THREAT, WHICH WAS NOT COOL AT ALL ... SO I WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW, I TOTALLY DISAPPROVED OF THE GESTURE, AND I REACTED VERY VIOLENTLY. I HAVE OBVIOUSLY NOT HIT HIM IN THE FACE, SINCE I COULD FIND MYSELF ON TRIAL FOR THAT, BUT LET&#39;S SAY I PUSHED HIM VIOLENTLY AND HE BOUNCED AGAINST THE WALL. I AM OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF THE PARADOX: I WANTED TO EVOKE THE NATURAL HUMAN TENDENCY TO AGGRESSION WITH THIS COLLECTION, AND I, WHO AM A DEEPLY PEACEFUL TYPE, WHO TRIES TO CREATE A WORLD OF SWEETNESS WHERE EVERYONE FEELS SAFE AND LOVED, FOUND MYSELF HAVING AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR... WHAT ALSO BOTHERED ME IS THE EFFECT THAT THIS ACTION MIGHT HAVE ON THE PERCEPTION OF MY WORK. PEOPLE KNOW THAT BY GOING TO MY SHOWS THEY WILL WITNESS SOMETHING STRONG, THEATRICAL, A MOVING STORY, BUT AVOIDING SENTIMENTALITY, AND SO FAR THAT BALANCE WORKED. NOW I SUDDENLY FEEL THAT THE MINDSET HAS CHANGED SLIGHTLY, BEGAN TO LEAN TOWARD THE IDEA OF A &quot;CIRCUS&quot;, A COMEDY, RATHER THAN A LOVE STORY. BUT OKAY, IN SEPTEMBER WE’LL SEE ABOUT THAT WITH THE WOMEN&#39;S COLLECTION, WHICH WILL BE VERY SOFT. IN PART, YOUR SHOWS SUGGEST RELIGIOUS PERSONALITIES. WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE RUNWAY IS VERY SPECIAL; IT IS A SHOW, NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SHOPS. INITIALLY, MY SHOWS WERE VERY NICE, DARK, GRAY AND CLASSICAL, AS I WANTED SOMETHING ELEGANT AND FORMAL. AND THEN I GAINED CONFIDENCE, AND I BEGAN TO EXPLORE, PLAY, AND I WANTED THE STRENGTH, THE FEROCITY, AND THE LOUD MUSIC. IF I WANT A COZY ATMOSPHERE, I GO TO THE MUSEUM. A KIND OF TRIBE ACCOMPANIES YOUR SHOWS, PEOPLE WEARING TOTAL RICK OWENS LOOKS, WITH PIERCINGS, TATTOOS... . I NEVER PLANNED IT, BUT ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS THAT THIS EXISTS. BUT YOU KNOW, MY WORK REPRESENTS A NICHE AND THE WORLD IS FULL OF NICHES, WITH THEIR OWN TRIBES. IT SEEMS THAT I HAVE HAD AN INFLUENCE, BUT I CONSIDER MYSELF PRIMARILY AN ECHO OF SOMETHING THAT EXISTED IN THE STREETS. I THEN STARTED EXCHANGING MESSAGES WITH THE WORLD, WHICH ANSWERED, AND THAT&#39;S A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. I NEVER IMAGINED SUCH A PATH ... WHEN I AM QUITE OLD, IT WILL BE A VERY COMFORTING THOUGHT. WHAT KIND OF CHILD WERE YOU? WHEN DID YOUR INNER NONCONFORMIST FIRST APPEAR? I BECAME NONCONFORMIST BY OBLIGATION. I WAS A VERY SHY CHILD, VERY EFFEMINATE, VERY FEARFUL AND VERY ISOLATED IN A CITY AND A CONSERVATIVE FAMILY. MY MOTHER WAS A TEACHER, MY FATHER - A SOCIAL WORKER IN CHARGE OF SELECTING HOST FAMILIES FOR CHILDREN TO PLACE, AND HE WAS A VERY CYNICAL MAN, THOUGH KIND TOO. BOTH DID NOT UNDERSTAND ME AND WERE VERY RELIGIOUS, HAD PURITAN LIMITS – ONLY NOW WE AGREED, RATHER WELL, THAT THEY WOULD COME TO MY SHOWS. I WAS ALSO BEING MOCKED AND ASSAULTED BY THE BOYS MY AGE. HOWEVER, IT WAS GREAT, BECAUSE IT FILLED ME WITH RAGE: I GREW UP, MY CHARACTER WAS HARDENED, AND I COULD ANSWER FOR MYSELF, AND THE ATTACKS HAVE CEASED. FROM THERE, I REJECTED ALL THAT WAS CONSIDERED &quot;NORMAL&quot; AND “STRAIGHT” IN THE WORLD, AND I DID EVERYTHING TO CHANGE IT. IN FACT, IF I COULD CONFORM TO THE STANDARD, I WOULD HAVE DONE IT, BUT IT WAS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE. AS FOR CLOTHES, I GRABBED WHAT WAS IN THE STREET, IN EVERY DAY LIFE; SNEAKERS, JEANS, SHIRTS, AND I SABOTAGED THIS NORMALITY, I EXAGGERATED, I INFECTED... IT WAS MY REVENGE. THE OTHER THING WAS TO CAST NON-CLASSICALLY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE IN MY SHOWS. THE MESSAGE IS: CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS. IT IS BY NO MEANS A MANIFESTO, BUT A PROPOSAL, A SUGGESTION. YOU SEEM ZEN AND PHILOSOPHICAL. ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING LIKE YOGA...? ABSOLUTELY NOT. AND I AM NOT AT ALL IN THE NEW AGE WITH ITS SPIRITUAL LIFE – I AM RATHER CYNICAL AND VERY PRAGMATIC. I SIMPLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT IS AS EASY TO WORK WITH GOOD ENERGY AS IT WITH THE BAD ONE. THE ONLY THING I DO, IS I GO TO THE GYM. INITIALLY, IT WAS FOR THE LOOK, NOT AT ALL FOR MY HEALTH. BUT IN FACT, IT GIVES ME A BALANCE AND TAKES ME OUT OF THE &quot;ME, ME, ME&quot; STATE, REMINDS ME THAT I&#39;M BASICALLY A STUPID ANIMAL, MADE OF FLESH AND BLOOD, AND IT PUTS THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS BOTH A FORM OF SPIRITUALITY AND MASTURBATION. YOU LOOK LIKE AN INDIAN CHIEF. MY MOTHER IS MEXICAN, WITH AZTEC ORIGINS, AND ON THAT SIDE OF THE FAMILY, PEOPLE HAVE DARK SKIN AND VERY STRONG FEATURES, LIKE MY NOSE. AS A CHILD I WANTED TO LOOK LIKE CHER AND JOE ALESSANDRO... I HAVE NATURALLY CURLY GRAY HAIR AND NOW, I DYE AND STRAIGHTEN IT. I ALSO TOOK STEROIDS, WORE BRACES ... EVERYTHING IS ARTIFICIAL AND I CHANGED EVERYTHING. I MADE SOMETHING GOOD FROM WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME. THE STATUES OF ME IN MY STORES ALSO HAVE THIS GOAL: TO SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHANGE. IF I CAN DO IT, EVERYONE IS CAPABLE. THE ARTIFICE IS A VERY GOOD THING, IT’S A MEANS. YOU MENTION YOUR AGE REGULARLY. DOES AGING BOTHER YOU? OF COURSE IT DOES. BUT WHAT MATTERS TO ME ARE THE RESULTS. I AM A FAN OF FASHION AND ART IN GENERAL, AND EACH TIME I CONSIDER THE WORK OF AN ARTIST, I WONDER: “WAS THE RIGOR MAINTAINED FROM START TO FINISH, AND INTENSITY AND CONSISTENCY?” AND I ASK MYSELF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY OWN WORK: “AM I GOING TO STAY TRUE TO MY VALUES, TO STICK TO THE COURSE TILL THE END?” KNOWING THAT I AM AWARE OF BEING AN INFINITESIMAL ELEMENT OF A MUCH LARGER WHOLE IS A BIG DEAL. IT IS ALSO REASSURING, WHICH PREVENTS ME FROM BEING TAKEN TOO SERIOUSLY AND GRANTING TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO MY AMBITIONS OR DESIRES. THE QUESTION IS: “WHAT WAS MY CONTRIBUTION, WHAT HAVE I BROUGHT TO THIS?” BEFORE YOU TURNED TO FASHION, YOU STUDIED ART. DO YOU FOLLOW CONTEMPORARY ART? I LOVE GOING TO FAIRS, BIENNIALS, BUT I HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH CONTEMPORARY ART. I NEED FOR ART TO HAVE THE PATINA OF HISTORY AND I FEEL THAT MANY OF THE CURRENT APPROACHES ARE AIMED MAINLY TO PROVE THAT ONE IS A LITTLE MALIGNANT, THAT THERE&#39;S A LOT OF SARCASM AND CYNICISM... I HAVE NO DESIRE TO SEE THESE JOKES IN MY HOME FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I GOT IT ALL WRONG ... WHEN I SOMETIMES LOOK BACK AT THE INTERVIEWS I GAVE, I AM STRUCK BY THE IMPRESSION THAT MY ANSWERS EMERGE FROM A LARGE PRETENTIOUS PEREMPTORY OPINION. BUT BASICALLY I DO NOT KNOW MUCH, AND MY OPINIONS ARE ONLY THOUGHTS, VERY MINOR ONES. I STILL HOPE TO LEARN A LOT. EVERY DAY I LOOK AT THE ART, INCLUDING BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE – IT GIVES ME PLEASURE. AND I DO NOT WANT EXPLANATIONS, I WANT FOR ART TO SEIZE ME, MAKE ME FALL BACKWARDS. YOUR COMPANY IS INDEPENDENT. HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED WORKING FOR OTHERS? I’M INDEPENDENT AND I&#39;M PROUD. THIS PHRASE MAY SOUND ARROGANT, BUT INDEPENDENCE CONTRIBUTES TO OUR UNIQUENESS AND WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS BECAUSE WE STARTED SLOWLY AND WE HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING WE COULDN’T AFFORD, SO IT NEVER TURNED INTO BATTLE. AT TIMES, I WAS ABSOLUTELY POOR, AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE, IT WAS COOL. I DID NOT NEED ANYTHING, I WAS FREE, AND I KNOW I COULD SURVIVE ANYTHING, ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY, MY RETURN TO POVERTY TODAY WOULD BE COMPLICATED... IN ANY CASE, IF I WOULD BECOME BROKE TOMORROW, I COULD AT LEAST TELL MYSELF, &quot;WOW, I HAD AN INCREDIBLE LIFE!” I HAVE HAD OFFERS, AND I HESITATED. THERE IS THE FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY, AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS GETTING TO OUR MAXIMUM VALUE. THE INVESTORS WOULD NOT WANT TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE, TO PAINT WITH A BIGGER BRUSH... BUT EACH TIME THEY WANTED TO BUY 51% OF THE COMPANY. AND THAT 1% IS WORRISOME, THREATENING. ASSHOLES! SO BUY 80% AND WHISK THE MONEY AWAY! THE WORLD OF FASHION IS SYNONYMOUS WITH PRESSURE, BURNOUT... I DO NOT KNOW THE PRESSURE. THIS IS ALSO WHY I STAY INDEPENDENT: I KNOW MYSELF, I CANNOT STAND HAVING TO JUSTIFY MYSELF, IT WOULD KILL ME. SO I NEVER PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A SITUATION. ANYWAY, THERE IS PRESSURE IN EVERY BUSINESS, AND BURNOUTS IN ALL TRADES... IN FACT, I MUST ADMIT, I AM NOT VERY UNDERSTANDING VIS-À-VIS THE BURNOUT: I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE ARE ADULTS, WE NEED TO KNOW OURSELVES AND LEARN TO PROTECT OURSELVES. WE MUST ALSO BE GRATEFUL, LOOK AROUND AND REALIZE HOW LUCKY WE ALREADY ARE - FOR NOT LIVING IN A COUNTRY AT WAR, FOR EXAMPLE. GRATITUDE IS ESSENTIAL TO HAPPINESS FOR ME. FOR FOURTEEN YEARS YOU LIVE AND WORK WITH YOUR WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY IN PARIS. WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND HERE? I LOVE LIVING HERE, KNOWING THAT MY LIFE IS NOT NORMAL: I LIVE IN THE 7TH DISTRICT, I RARELY GO OUT, AND I NEVER LEARNED FRENCH... I NEED TO COMMUNICATE QUICKLY AND PEOPLE WHO SPEAK ENGLISH SURROUND ME. I MUST SAY THAT I NEVER HAD THE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS LIKE ELECTRIC CONNECTION. I&#39;M NOT AN EXTROVERT; I SPEND A LOT OF TIME ALONE, AND MY SURROUNDINGS CONSISTS OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM I WORK: FORMING A UNITED GROUP IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IT IS NOT ARTIFICIAL. YOUR WORK BECOMES YOUR SECOND FAMILY. MICHÈLE IS ESSENTIAL TO ME, SHE BALANCES ME, COMPLETES ME. I AM PRAGMATIC; IT HAS TO LEAD RIGHT FROM POINT A TO POINT B. SHE IS FLEXIBLE, INTUITIVE, TAKES SHORTCUTS... WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD, DO YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS? I KNOW MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENS. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE BROADCASTS, ESPECIALLY POLITICS: I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH, AND I&#39;M SKEPTICAL, I FEEL THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN ACCURATE OVERVIEW OF THE SITUATION. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT ONCE WE HAVE REACHED SOME FORM OF SECURITY, WHEN WE HAVE PROTECTED AND FED OUR FAMILY, CONTRIBUTING TO THE BEAUTY IS A FORM OF MORAL OBLIGATION TO THE HEALTH OF THE WORLD – SCIENCE AND INVENTIONS INCLUDED. SO, IN SOME WAY, EVEN IF I AM NO POLITICIAN, I CREATE A VALUE THAT HAS A POLITICAL DIMENSION. HOW DO YOU VIEW THE NEXT GENERATION OF FASHION? I DON’T REALLY VIEW IT YET. I EXPECT A REACTION... FROM YOUNG PEOPLE IN GENERAL, ACTUALLY. IN MY VIEW, IT LACKS FLAMBOYANCE, I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE MADNESS AS THERE IS, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RAP SCENE IN CHICAGO, OR THE GAY RAP SCENE IN AUSTIN, TEXAS... BUT MAYBE I DO NOT SEE WHAT HAPPENS, MAYBE I&#39;M NOT GOING TO WHERE THIS GOES. 52 YEARS OLD, A RESIDENT OF THE 7TH DISTRICT, IN THIS HOUSE WHERE, AT NIGHT, I CAN HEAR THE GUARDS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE GO ABOUT THEIR ROUNDS: IT IS CLEAR THAT MANY THINGS ESCAPE ME. AND MAYBE NOW, REACTION, REBELLION, TAKES OTHER FORMS, PERHAPS IT WILL COME FROM THE INTERNET, FOR EXAMPLE, AND WE WILL BE VERY SURPRISED. LAMY THE ESSENTIAL RICK OWENS IS INSEPARABLE FROM MICHÈLE LAMY, A CHARACTER EQUALLY UNIQUE. THERE OBVIOUSLY IS THE LOOK: 70 YEARS OLD, THE BLUE-GRAY EYES DARKLY LINED, BURGUNDY HAIR, FOREHEAD DIVIDED BY A BLACK LINE, THE GOLDEN TEETH LIKE THE ONES RAPPERS HAVE, ARMS AND FINGERS COVERED IN BRACELETS AND RINGS. RICK OWENS’ WIFE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A FEMALE SHAMAN SUITABLE FOR ALL SPELLS; JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HER RECENT PERFORMANCE IN THE VIDEO “MLL155X” BY FKA TWIGS. HER PATH IS ALSO WORTH SEEING. A JURA NATIVE, SHE FIRST STUDIED LAW AND LITERATURE IN LYON BEFORE HEADING TO PARIS, WHERE SHE FOUND HER WAY WITH HELENE HAZERA, A FIGURE ON THE TRANS SCENE AND FUTURE JOURNALIST WITH LIBÉRATION. MICHÈLE LAMY GOT INTO FASHION IN 1974, VIA ACCESSORIES, NAMELY JEWELS. SHE MOVED TO NEW YORK IN THE PROCESS, WHERE SHE IMMERSED HERSELF IN THE UNDERGROUND SCENE. LOS ANGELES WAS THE NEXT STOP, WHERE SHE CREATED A CLOTHING LINE BASED ON MESHED FABRIC. IT WAS THIS BUSINESS WHERE SHE MET AND HIRED RICK OWENS FOR THE MEN’S COLLECTION. THE PERPETUAL MUTANT HAD MEANWHILE OPENED A RESTAURANT-CLUB IN LA, LES DEUX CAFES, WHICH SOON BECAME HYPED. A PARTNER, AN ALTER EGO, A CONSULTANT, A MIDDLEMAN, A GRAY EMINENCE... HER ROLE AS RICK OWENS’ INFLUENCER (WHO WE ASSUME IS BISEXUAL) IS MULTIPLE AND RHIZOMIC. LOGICAL, FROM A FAN OF GILLES DELEUZE.

AGAINST THE HAUSSMANN-STYLE FACADES OF NEARBY GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AND THE GENERAL FRENCH OPULENCE OF THE 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT, OWENS&#39; PARISIAN RESIDENCE-CUM-STUDIO COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE CONTRASTING&mdash;A STARK CONCRETE BUNKER, SAVE FOR THE ACCENTS OF FLOURISH. A SET OF ART DECO DOUBLE DOORS AT THE HEIGHT OF A FLIGHT OF STAIRS MARKED THE GATEWAY INTO THE DESIGNER&rsquo;S INNER CIRCLE. PAST THE ENTRANCE, IMPORTANT OBJET D&rsquo;ART, NEXT SEASON&rsquo;S RAILS AND A TEAM OF DEDICATED STAFF DOTTED THE PATH TO THE PATIO WHERE WE WERE TOLD TO WAIT. &nbsp; IN THE SUNDAY BREEZE, THIS SIDE OF THE APARTMENT SEEMED ESPECIALLY WELCOMING; ITS INFORMALITY APT FOR THE PERSONAL CONVERSATION THAT WAS ABOUT TO ENSUE. THE MIND RATTLED WITH A CONFLUENCE OF EXPECTATION-VERSUS-REALITY CONUNDRUMS AS ONE TRIED TO VISUALISE THE EXCHANGE WITH FASHION&rsquo;S ULTIMATE CULT FIGURE. &nbsp; WITH THE MEN&rsquo;S S/S 16 SHOW HAVING CONCLUDED LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO, TWITTER WAS STILL ABLAZE WITH RE-TWEETS OF THE POLITICAL STUNT PULLED DURING THE SHOW BY JERA DIARC, RICK OWEN&rsquo;S LONG-TIME MUSE. THE GERMAN MODEL HAD MARCHED DOWN THE CATWALK WITH A HAND-WRITTEN NOTE THAT READ &ldquo;KILL ANGELA MERKEL, NOT&rdquo;. IT TOOK SOCIAL MEDIA BY STORM AND CONJURED SOMETHING FOR THE KEYBOARD WARRIORS TO SINK THEIR TEETH INTO. BUT THE WAVES OF THE RUNWAY SCANDAL NEVER MADE IT INTO THE HOUSE. RICK OWEN&rsquo;S BRUTALIST SANCTUARY IS MADE OF THICK WALLS, AND THE AIR THAT IT FRAMES IS ONE OF ACETIC TRANQUILITY. THAT DAY WAS BUSINESS-AS-USUAL. &nbsp; THE SHORT WAIT WAS INTERRUPTED BY A BRIGHT CALIFORNIAN ACCENT. &ldquo;HI GUYS!&rdquo; QUIPPED RICK, DECKED IN HIS UNIFORM: A SOFT GREY KNIT, BLACK SHORTS OVER TIGHTS AND HIS DRKSHDW HIGH TOP RAMONES. A GENUINE SMILE SEGUED INTO A FIRM HAND-SHAKE. ANY PRESUPPOSITION WE MIGHT HAVE OF A DISTANT, PERHAPS ALOOF CULT LEADER QUICKLY DISSIPATED WITH RICK&rsquo;S WARM, MAGNETIC PRESENCE. &nbsp; IN FACT, A COURTEOUS ATTEMPT AT SKIRTING AROUND THE TOPIC OF JERA&rsquo;S FAUX PAS PROVED FUTILE AS RICK DIVED INTO THE TOPIC AND ADDRESSED IT HEAD ON. AS THE INTERVIEW PROGRESSED, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT RICK THRIVES ON CHALLENGING ANY COMMON PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT HIM OR HIS WORLD. CITING DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE FORCES AS THE FUEL TO HIS CREATIVE PROCESS&mdash;EVIDENCED ULTIMATELY BY THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND MICHELE LAMY (HIS BETTER HALF)&mdash;RICK OWENS STRADDLES A FINE LINE ON WHICH HE BUILDS HIS UNIVERSE. AMIDST THE MULTIPLE PROJECTS THAT ADD TO THE MOMENTUM OF HIS BRAND, RICK ATTRIBUTES HIS SUCCESS TO ONE MONOLITHIC VISION: AT THE HEART OF IT ALL, IS &ldquo;KINDNESS&rdquo;, HE SAID. THE KEY TO HIS LONG-STANDING SACRED SANCTUM IS AS PROFOUNDLY SIMPLE AS THAT. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A CAVEAT, &ldquo;I THINK MY WORLD IS VERY EASY TO ENTER, BUT I TEND TO WANDER AWAY FROM IT EVERY COUPLE OF MINUTES.&rdquo; &nbsp; R: THIS COLLABORATION IS GREAT BECAUSE WE&#39;RE HAVING A VERY PRODUCTIVE, INDUSTRIOUS PERIOD. IT&#39;S NICE TO HAVE AN EXCUSE TO DOCUMENT AND MYTHOLOGIZE IT. &nbsp; V: IT&#39;S LIKE AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL PROJECT. &nbsp; YES, VERY MUCH. &nbsp; THAT&#39;S EXACTLY HOW I&#39;M LOOKING AT IT, WITH THE DIAGRAMS AND EVERYTHING&mdash;IT&#39;S VERY SCIENTIFIC. &nbsp; WE&#39;VE HAD A LOOK AT MOST OF THE IMAGES FROM THE CURATION, SO WE&#39;RE IN THE PROCESS OF DECRYPTING IT. WHAT IS THE THREAD THAT TIES IT ALL TOGETHER? &nbsp; I THINK IT&#39;S MONUMENTALISM. &nbsp; WHEN I PUT AN OUTFIT TOGETHER, THE IS-SUES I THINK ABOUT COME FROM VARIOUS PLACES. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE BAGGY SKATE SHORTS ARE WHAT I THINK THE RAMONES MIGHT HAVE WORN. ALTERNATIVELY, IT COULD BE SOMETHING MONASTIC, MAYBE A TURTLE-NECK CASHMERE SWEATER THAT JULIETTE GRECO WOULD HAVE WORN IN THE 1950S. &nbsp; GENERALLY, I LIKE TO THINK OF THE CLOTHES IN A BIGGER PERSPECTIVE, RATHER THAN THEIR SIGNIFICANCE RIGHT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. WHEN I USE THESE REFERENCES, I CAN THINK OF MYSELF AS PART OF THIS HUGE, HUGE HISTORICAL PICTURE INSTEAD OF JUST WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING THIS YEAR. THIS MAKES ME FEEL PART OF SOME-THING MORE ETERNAL. &nbsp; SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT? &nbsp; YES, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT MAKES ME FEEL INSIGNIFICANT. IT REMINDS ME NOT TO TAKE MYSELF TOO SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I&#39;M JUST ONE TINY SPECK IN THIS HUGE PICTURE OF EVOLUTION. ALL I&#39;M DOING IS CONTRIBUTING A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY. &nbsp; AT SOME POINT NOW, I SUPPOSE WE&#39;RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY MEN&#39;S S/S 16 SHOW AND THE PROTESTOR. &nbsp; WHEN I SAW HIM, IMMEDIATELY I WAS PISSED OFF BECAUSE I FELT THAT THAT WAS MY SCENE AND HE WAS STEALING MY SPOTLIGHT. THAT INITIAL REACTION MAY HAVE BEEN VANITY, BUT AS I GAVE IT MORE THOUGHT, I REALISED WHAT IT WAS THAT REALLY INFURIATED ME: IT&#39;S ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT TO ME THAT MY SHOWS DELIVER SOME KIND OF POSITIVE MESSAGE ABOUT HUMANITY; SOMETHING ABOUT KINDNESS, INCLUSION, TOLERANCE, BEAUTY. &nbsp; HIS PROTEST JUST MESSED EVERYTHING UP. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FUNNY, EXCEPT THAT IT WAS A DEATH THREAT, WHICH REALLY ISN&#39;T FUNNY AT ALL. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED IT OFF AS JUST SOME GREAT, MALE FASHION DRAMA. &nbsp; THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT AFTER THIS DEBACLE, MY NEXT SHOW, FOR THE WOMEN&#39;S LINE, WHICH I HAVE PLANNED TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXTREME, IS JUST GOING TO SEEM LIKE A STUNT. HIS PROTEST HAS STAINED THE PURITY OF WHAT I AM TRYING TO ACHIEVE. &nbsp; I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME TO THE NEXT SHOW WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. IF NOT FOR THIS GUY, THEY WOULD BE MORE OPEN; THEY WOULD HAVE COME THINKING THAT WHATEVER EXTREME THING RICK OWENS DOES, IT IS GOING TO BE DONE IN A LOVING WAY. NOW, THERE&#39;S AN ELEMENT OF COMEDY THAT HAS JUST BE-SMIRCHED EVERYTHING. &nbsp; BUT THEN AGAIN, MAYBE THAT&#39;S JUST MY OPINION TODAY. MAYBE TWO WEEKS FROM NOW IT&#39;LL ALL JUST BLOW OVER. &nbsp; YES, I&#39;M SURE. AND IT WAS A FANTASTIC SHOW. &nbsp; IT WAS, I LIKED IT. HONESTLY, I&#39;M NOT THAT UPSET, BUT IT&#39;S MADE ME ANALYSE THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. &nbsp; ANOTHER BIG MESSAGE I HAVE WITH MY SHOWS IS THAT EVERYBODY, ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET CAN BE WILDLY ATTRACTIVE. YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO POSSESS STANDARDIZED BEAUTY. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AN OPEN HEART AND AN EASY LAUGH, YOU CAN BE BEAUTIFUL. &nbsp; WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SPACES. AS OF NOW, YOU HAVE GOT QUITE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE&mdash;YOU HAVE THE APARTMENT IN CONCORDIA, YOUR HONG KONG STORE, SO WHAT IS MOTIVATING THIS SPURT OF ENERGY? &nbsp; I DON&#39;T KNOW IF UNDERTAKING ALL THESE PROJECTS AT THE SAME TIME WAS REALLY ALL THAT DELIBERATE. IT JUST HAPPENED THAT THEY ALL FELL TOGETHER. OPPORTUNITIES AROSE AND WE TOOK THEM, AND IT&#39;S JUST ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHICH EVERYONE HOPES FOR&mdash; TO HAVE THINGS GOING WELL AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF IN AS THOROUGH A WAY AS POSSIBLE. IT&#39;S A FANTASTIC SITUATION THAT I DON&#39;T REALLY THINK WAS WILLED INTO BEING. IT IS JUST INVESTMENT AND MOMENTUM THAT HAS SNOWBALLED IN THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY. &nbsp; YOU SEEM TO ALWAYS HAVE HAD A PLACE WITHIN ARCHITECTURE. WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES, I ALMOST INTUITIVELY IMAGINE THE SPACE THAT THEY LIVE IN. THERE IS SOME-THING ABOUT YOUR WORLD THAT TRANSPORTS PEOPLE INTO A VERY SPECIFIC, MONOLITHIC SPACE. HOW DOES ARCHITECTURE INFORM YOUR WORK? &nbsp; I LOVE LOOKING AT INTERIORS. I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE EXPRESS SO MUCH MORE PROFOUNDLY AND ACCURATELY IN INTERIORS RATHER THAN IN CLOTHES BECAUSE IT DOESN&#39;T CHANGE SO OFTEN. THERE IS A SENSE OF PERMANENCE, MEANING THAT YOU HAVE TO REALLY DECIDE WHAT YOUR MESSAGE IS AND COMMIT TO IT, WHEREAS IN FASHION, THE SINCERITY CAN BE QUESTIONABLE. &nbsp; EVEN FOR ME, EVERY SEASON, I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF, &quot;DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN THIS?&quot; FOR CLOTHES, THERE IS JUST A LOT TO PRODUCE. QUANTITATIVELY, THERE IS A LOT TO ACHIEVE SO YOU FIND YOURSELF MOVING AT A CERTAIN PACE. YOU CAN&#39;T EVALUATE EVERYTHING INDEPENDENTLY OR ISOLATE EVERY ELEMENT, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU&#39;RE ENGAGED IN MORE OF A ROLLING-ALONG PROCESS. THIS FORCES YOU TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE. &nbsp; THAT IS WHY I ALWAYS HAVE TO ASK MYSELF, &quot;AM I BEING INFLUENCED BY THE CUSTOMERS THAT COME INTO THE STORE? AM I BEING INFLUENCED BY MY ASSISTANTS, MY PARTNERS, OR BY MICHELE?&quot; HOW DO I SHUT ALL OF THAT OFF AND MAKE SOMETHING THAT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE? I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE I HAVE ALREADY ANALYSED THIS AND THAT I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO, BUT IT STILL ISN&#39;T EASY TO ACCOMPLISH. IT REQUIRES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONCENTRATION TO ISOLATE YOUR THOUGHTS, SO EVEN UP TILL NOW I&#39;M NOT REALLY CONVINCED I&#39;VE GOT IT. &nbsp; A LOT OF PEOPLE DESCRIBE YOUR AESTHETIC VISION AS BRUTALIST. &nbsp; MHM, AND I&#39;M GLAD. I KEPT USING THEIR WORD OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO MUCH SO THAT IT BECAME MY THING. IF YOU INSIST ON SOMETHING LONG ENOUGH, PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE YOU. ALSO, IT&#39;S GOOD BECAUSE IT HAS ALLOWED ME TO DISTANCE MYSELF FROM THE GOTH THING. &nbsp; WE SAW A SAARINEN CHAIR IN THE IMAGES YOU PUT TOGETHER. HE WAS RATHER INSPIRED BY THE WORKS OF THE ARCHITECT, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND ART DECO&mdash;DO YOU RELATE TO THAT WORLD AT ALL? &nbsp; I LOVE BRUTALISM, BUT I LOVE ART NOUVEAU TOO. ART NOUVEAU IS SO SENTIMENTAL, SO INCREDIBLY SENTIMENTAL AND SHAMELESSLY SO. WE LIVE IN ERA OF IRONY AND SARCASM SO WHEN I SEE SOMETHING SO SENTIMENTAL, IT&#39;S VERY APPEALING. &nbsp; THAT BEING SAID, I ONLY LOVE SEEING ART NOUVEAU WITH A LOT OF SPACE AROUND IT&mdash;LIKE MAYBE A FANCY LITTLE FLOWER IN A BIG WHITE ROOM. I COULDN&#39;T LIVE IN A COMPLETE ART NOUVEAU-DICTATED ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE A LITTLE TOO LITERAL. &nbsp; WHAT ARE YOU GUYS SHOOTING TODAY? &nbsp; TOWN AND COUNTRY MAGAZINE. ISN&#39;T THAT STRANGE? BUT THEN AGAIN, I&#39;VE AL-WAYS LIKED THE PUBLICATION, THEY HAVE THIS OLD-MONEY, OLD-FAMILY VIBE. THERE IS ACTUALLY A VERY PURITANICAL, CONSERVATIVE STREAK IN ME THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE AND RESPECT. &nbsp; I ASSUME THAT THEY ARE JUST USING ME AS A KIND OF COLORFUL NOVELTY, BUT THAT&#39;S FINE. I STILL THINK THE COLLABORATION WORKS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOTHES THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY SUIT THEIR READERS. ALSO, IT&#39;S NOT LIKE WE ARE FREAKS THAT THEY PICKED UP FROM THE STREET. THERE ARE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THEIR WORLD AND MINE; IT IS CRAZY BUT IT ALSO MAKES SENSE AT THE SAME TIME. &nbsp; SOMETIMES, PEOPLE THINK THAT I&#39;M LIKE SOME KIND OF TERRORIST BUT IN REALITY, A LOT OF THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE AT THE BRAND ARE QUITE CONSERVATIVE. &nbsp; HOW SO? &nbsp; I PROPOSE A WORLD THAT IS VERY DISCREET. YOU WOULDN&#39;T GUESS IT FROM MY SHOWS BUT I THINK IF YOU GO TO MOUNT STREET, YOU WILL EXPERIENCE A DISCREET, QUIET ATMOSPHERE WHERE POLITENESS AND KINDNESS ARE PARAMOUNT. ALL OF OUR STAFF, ALL OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS TEAM ARE VERY LOVING AND CALM. &nbsp; THAT IS TRUE&mdash;I&#39;VE OBSERVED THAT WHEN I&#39;VE VISITED THE STORE. HOWEVER, THE SPACES ALSO SEEM TO FEEL QUITE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED AND PROVOCATIVE&mdash; HOW DO YOU DO THAT? &nbsp; OH, I DON&#39;T KNOW. &nbsp; MAYBE THAT&#39;S THE WHOLE ENIGMA. &nbsp; WELL, THERE&#39;S DEFINITELY A SENSE OF THEATRE. IT&#39;S OPERA, IT&#39;S ALL OPERA AND THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT HAVE IN COMMON WITH THESE TOWN AND COUNTRY READERS. I WAS RAISED ON OPERA AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS: SOMETIMES THE STORIES IN OPERA ARE JUST THE DUMBEST. &nbsp; HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO A PURSUIT OF BEAUTY IN EACH AND EVERY SHOW. IT&#39;S ALWAYS AN ATTEMPT TO REACH A LEVEL THAT IS ON A HIGHER EMOTIONAL, SPIRITUAL PLANE THAT PEOPLE ARE USUALLY AT. &nbsp; WOULD YOU CALL THAT TRANSCENDENCE? &nbsp; YES, EXACTLY THAT. TRANSCENDENCE IS THE BASIS OF ALL OPERAS. A LOT OF THE TIME, IT IS A STATE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTAIN SO IT&#39;S A MATTER OF HITTING THAT LAST BEAUTIFUL NOTE AND JUST &#39;DYING&#39;. &nbsp; DO YOU FEEL THAT ABOUT YOUR COLLECTIONS? IS EVERY SHOW A SIMILAR ATTEMPT TO HIT THAT FINAL NOTE? &nbsp; I DON&#39;T KNOW. I&#39;M NOT VERY TORTURED. I&#39;M QUITE A PRACTICAL PERSON. AFTER A SHOW, I DO OBSESS OVER THE MISTAKES, BUT I ALSO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE. I DON&#39;T FEEL LIKE I EVER TAKE BIG RISKS BECAUSE I ALWAYS PLAN AHEAD AND I DON&#39;T DO LAST MINUTE CHANGES. &nbsp; TO THE OUTSIDER, THERE SEEMS TO BE A RATHER IMPERMEABLE INNER SANCTUM, LAYERS YOU HAVE TO PEEL BEFORE REACHING THE RICK OWENS WORLD. DO YOU CONSCIOUSLY DIVIDE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LIFE? &nbsp; OH, NO. I DON&#39;T REALLY HAVE A PUBLIC LIFE. THERE MAY BE A PERCEPTION OF A DIVISION, BUT THERE REALLY ISN&#39;T. I&#39;M ON THE METRO EVERY DAY, GOING TO THE GYM. TAXIS MAKE ME CRAZY. I&#39;M ONLY EVER ON THE METRO OR IN A CAR WITH A DRIVER. WHEN YOU GET INTO A TAXI, YOU&#39;RE GOING INTO SOMEONE&#39;S PERSONAL FART SPACE AND YOU CAN&#39;T GET OUT. AT LEAST IN THE METRO, YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND AND SURFACE OR MOVE INTO ANOTHER PART IF SOMEBODY&#39;S ARMPIT IN IS IN YOUR FACE. &nbsp; DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU LET PEOPLE IN EASILY? &nbsp; WELL, I DON&#39;T KNOW. POLITENESS CAN ALSO BE A DEFENSE. I DON&#39;T ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE THAT EASILY. ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, THERE ARE SO MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT I MUST HAVE AND SO MANY PEOPLE TO TALK TO, SO I TEND TO OVERSATURATE. IT DOESN&#39;T HELP THAT I&#39;M NOT NATURALLY A VERY GREGARIOUS PERSON. THAT IS WHY I TAKE A NAP AROUND 1 OR 2 PM, EVERY SINGLE DAY. MY DAY IS SCHEDULED AROUND THAT NAP. IT IS SOMETHING OF A TEMPORARY SUICIDE. IT&#39;S ESCAPING FROM EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING&mdash;I JUST CAN&#39;T DEAL WITH THAT MUCH ENGAGEMENT. &nbsp; SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I THINK MY WORLD IS VERY EASY TO ENTER, BUT I TEND TO WANDER AWAY FROM IT EVERY SO OFTEN. &nbsp; I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE FLOOR PLAN OF YOUR NEW APARTMENT. IT LOOKS FANTASTIC; THE GYM IS SO BIG. HOW DO YOU SHARE THE SPACE WITH MICHELE? DO YOU HAVE SEPARATE AREAS? &nbsp; OH YES. THAT&#39;S BECOME TRICKIER AS THE YEARS HAVE GONE ON BECAUSE NOW WE AREN&#39;T AS CONCERNED WITH THE SURVIVAL OF THE BRAND AS WE HAD BEEN. WHEN YOU AREN&#39;T SO CONCERNED WITH SURVIVAL, YOU ARE ABLE TO PURSUE THE LUXURY OF SOMETHING ELSE. FOR US, THAT LUXURY IS SELF-EXPRESSION AND A DIFFERING DEFINITION OF BEAUTY FROM THE MAINSTREAM. &nbsp; WHAT OTHER CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED? &nbsp; WELL, THE ART PIECES THAT WE GET ARE NOW A LOT BIGGER, THOUGH TO BE HONEST, I CAN&#39;T REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE. I CAN&#39;T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HALF A MILLION AND TWO THOUSAND EUROS. IT&#39;S JUST ALL A LOT. MICHELE ALWAYS SAYS, &quot;YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU NEVER BUY A LOT, BUT YOU JUST BUY HUGE THINGS THAT COST&rdquo; &nbsp; WHAT WAS YOUR LAST BIG-TICKET PURCHASE? &nbsp; AN APARTMENT IN THE LIDO. &nbsp; WAS THAT THE ONE THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE TO BUILD? WITH THE PERMITS? &nbsp; THEY&#39;RE ALL NIGHTMARES TO BUILD. OUR PROPERTIES INCLUDE THIS PLACE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY AT, AN APARTMENT AT THE CONCORDIA AND ONE AT THE LIDO. I ACTUALLY GAVE UP ON THIS ONE SO IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE OF MICHELE&#39;S DOMAIN. &nbsp; WE&#39;VE HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONFLICT THESE PAST FEW YEARS ON THE APARTMENTS, WHICH MADE ME REALISE THAT SPATIALLY, WE WANT REALLY DIFFERENT THINGS. MICHELE WANTS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHAOS AND FLUIDITY WHEREAS I WANT RESOLUTION. &nbsp; I WANT THE STRAIGHTEST LINE BETWEEN POINT A AND POINT B, AND I WANT TO GET THERE AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. MICHELE LEAVES POINT A BUT SHE COULDN&#39;T CARE LESS WHETHER SHE ARRIVES AT POINT B. IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT THE JOURNEY THERE, WHICH IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND GENIUS. AT SOME POINT IN TIME, I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO REALISE THAT MY RIGIDITY NEEDED TO BE COMPLEMENTED BY HER FLUIDITY. &nbsp; WHEN THAT BECAME OBVIOUS, I KNEW THAT I HAD TO DERIVE MY SATISFACTION ELSEWHERE BECAUSE I&#39;M NOT GOING TO GET THAT RESOLUTION AT THIS PARTICULAR APARTMENT. THAT&#39;S WHY I GOT THE ONE AT THE LIDO. NOW, I&#39;M ENJOYING THIS PLACE AS MICHELE&#39;S EXPRESSION OF WARMTH THAT I DON&#39;T REALLY HAVE. MY EXPRESSIONS ARE A LITTLE MORE CHILLY AND CONTROLLED. &nbsp; OF ALL THE SPACES THAT YOU HAVE CREATED&mdash;PERSONAL ONES INCLUDED&mdash;WHERE DO YOU FEEL THE MOST AT HOME? WHERE DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN WORK? &nbsp; OH, IN CONCORDIA. I HAVE AN OFFICE IN THE FACTORY AND AN APARTMENT NEXT DOOR WITH A GYM IN IT. TWO WEEKS BEFORE EVERY COLLECTION, I&#39;M THERE FOR TWO WEEKS. EVERY DAY, I HAVE FOOD DELIVERED, I TAKE A NAP IN THE OFFICE THEN I GO HOME AND WATCH SOME SITCOMS BEFORE I GO TO BED. &nbsp; YOU WATCH SITCOMS? &nbsp; OH YEAH. WHAT WAS THE LAST ONE THAT I WATCHED? OH CUCUMBER AND BANANA. THEY&#39;RE ACTUALLY GENIUS. &nbsp; SO ANYWAY, IT&#39;S TWO WEEKS OF THAT AND I HAVE TO SPEND A WEEKEND IN THE FACTORY, WHEN NOBODY&#39;S THERE. I HAVE TO BE IN AN EMPTY FACTORY WHERE I CAN GO DOWN TO THE FABRICS AND TAKE SOME CUTTINGS... &nbsp; ASSISTANT: SORRY, EXCUSE ME. MICHELE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU IN THE PHOTOS. &nbsp; OH YES, THAT&#39;S FINE. GOOD IDEA. THIS IS ONE OF THE TIMES WHERE I FORGET THINGS AND MICHELE, HER HEART REMEMBERS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. &nbsp; I SHAN&rsquo;T HOLD YOU FOR ANY LONGER BUT BE-FORE THAT I JUST HAVE TO ASK, WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE COLOUR? &nbsp; GREY. IT HAS EVERYTHING IN IT, AND IT IS SOFT, GENTLE, AMBIGUOUS, MYSTERIOUS. &nbsp; AND LASTLY DO YOU HAVE ANY PROJECTS THAT YOU ARE JUST ACHING TO DO? ANY DREAMS THAT ARE UNFULFILLED? &nbsp; I DON&#39;T... I WOULD FEEL GUILTY JUST THINKING ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I&#39;VE HAD SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO FULFILL DREAM IDEAS. I&#39;M NOT SAYING THAT I&#39;VE GOT EVERYTHING I WANT, BUT I&#39;VE DEFINITELY GOTTEN MORE THAN I DESERVE SO I SHOULD JUST BE SATISFIED WITH THAT. YOU KNOW THE KEY TO HAPPINESS IS GRATITUDE. EVERYBODY CAN BE GRATEFUL FOR SOMETHING. &nbsp; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

I KNOW WHAT YOUR SAYING— BUT IF YOU PRIORITIZE YOU CAN BE MORE SELECTIVE IN BUYING THINGS THAT ARE REALLY SPECIAL. DIGITALFLOWERSPROJECT ASKED: RICK, DO YOU USE CREATIVITY AS A WAY TO SUBLIMATE YOUR INNER DESIRES AND TEMPTATIONS? PROBABLY. BUT I THINK IT’S A WAY TO SHARE AND ENGAGE IN THE WORLD I LIVE IN AS FULLY AS I CAN. FASHIONMOVESFORWARD ASKED: RICK, HOW FUN WAS DESIGNING THIS LATEST COLLECTION? IT WAS REALLY FUN. I THINK PEOPLE DON’T REALIZE HOW SELFISH I REALLY AM… I WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT TO GO SEE. I DIDN’T EXPECT EVERYONE TO LIKE IT— JUST HOPEFULLY ENOUGH THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE DOING THINGS I LIKE. CHEERS R AMARR1 ASKED: SOME HISTORIANS BELIEVE THAT INTERSUBJECTIVITY (A PHENOMENON WHERE PEOPLE ADOPT OTHER PEOPLE’S PERSONALITIES FOR VARIOUS REASONS) IS EXTREMELY PRESENT IN FASHION. GIVEN THAT YOUR OWN PERSONALITY AND LIFE IS CONSTANTLY ON DISPLAY FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SEE (E.G. INTERVIEWS, PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOUR HOME, VIDEOS, ETC.) DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE ADOPTING, EITHER CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY, WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE YOUR PERSONALITY WHEN WEARING YOUR CLOTHING? MAYBE. BUT I ALWAYS FELT THAT WHAT YOU WEAR IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS BEING THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE. AND I HAVE CERTAINLY HAD EXAMPLES I WANTED TO FOLLOW IN THE PAST. BUT I DON’T FEEL EXPOSED ENOUGH TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE— I DON’T THINK I’LL EVER HAVE THAT KIND OF POPULARITY. DEAJHADZIRE ASKED: WHERE DID YOU GET THE IDEA OF YOUR MODELS WALKING WITH OTHERS AROUND THEIR NECK? THERE WAS AN ANNIE LEIBOVITZ IMAGE OF LEIGH BOWERY CARRYING HIS WIFE NICOLA IN A HARNESS THEY WOULD USE FOR A BIRTHING PERFORMANCE THAT I ALWAYS LOVED. IT WAS TRANSGRESSIVE AND SWEET AT THE SAME TIME. I THOUGHT DOING IT WITH WOMEN WOULD BE A NICE INTERPRETATION AND DEVELOPED OTHER POSES FROM THERE. CHEERS R FVSHIONIZED ASKED: WHAT’S THE ONE THING YOU WISH YOU KNEW WHEN YOU WERE 18, THAT YOU KNOW NOW? I WISH I KNEW THAT I DIDN’T HAVE TO TRY TO BE SOMEONE ELSE— THAT I COULD JUST WORK WITH WHAT I HAD. CHEERS R DREAMBELIEVELOVELIFE ASKED: WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO A YOUNG DESIGNER WHO SEES A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY, BUT STRUGGLES TO FIND WHERE IN THE INDUSTRY THEY WOULD FEEL THE MOST FULFILLED? THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS SIMILAR TO THIS HERE AND I TOTALLY SYMPATHIZE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO FIND THEIR PLACE. I DON’T KNOW IF I HAVE THE ANSWER BUT LOGIC TELLS ME THAT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO, DO A LOT OF IT ALL THE TIME SO YOU CAN THROW AWAY YOUR MISTAKES AND YOUR VOICE WILL EMERGE FOR BETTER OR WORSE. GOOD LUCK R I-MPERSISTENCE ASKED: WHAT ARE YOUR FAV. MUSIC ARTISTS RN? I AM LISTENING TO MIKE Q VOGUING MIXES AT THE GYM AND PEGGY LEE AND JULIE LONDON AT WORK. OH, AND KATIE GOT BANDZ IN BETWEEN! CHEERS R BROKEWITH-EXPENSIVETASTE ASKED: JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT SHOW WAS BEAUTIFUL. IT HIT MY SOUL. THANK YOU, I AM SO GLAD. IT’S HARD TO TELL HOW PEOPLE WILL RESPOND BECAUSE IT TAKES A WHILE TO ORGANIZE AND REFINE BY THE TIME A SHOW ARRIVES I USED UP ALL THE EMOTION I FELT AT THE BEGINNING WHEN I WAS CONCEIVING IT. BUT I’M NOT FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF— I WAS ABLE TO EXTEND THAT EMOTION OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME ON MY OWN. I JUST DIDN’T GET TO SHARE THE PEAK WITH YOU. CHEERS R ANOTHERUNLUCKYGUY ASKED: WHY DO YOU LIKE TO SHOCK? I LIKE TO BE SHOCKED CHEERS R AROMAMOTH ASKED: HOW DO YOU WORK TOWARD DISMANTLING AN INDUSTRY THAT PROFITS OFF OF UNHEALTHY STANDARDS FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN? THEY WOULDN’T PROFIT IF THERE WAS NO DEMAND. LIFE ISN’T FAIR. JUST PUT OUT YOUR OWN GOOD ENERGY. CHEERS R HOWTOBERIDICULOUS ASKED: WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE PRINCE SONG? THE BEAUTIFUL ONES CHEERS R CL0SED-CURT4INS ASKED: HOW DO YOU SEPARATE YOUR WORK AT DIOR FROM YOUR OWN BRAND AND THEN MANAGE TO MAKE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COLLECTIONS? I LOVE YOU R SPACE-ROCK-VOODOO ASKED: WERE YOU INTO PUNK MUCH? YOU’RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PUNK FASHION DESIGNERS AROUND. I DON’T THINK I WAS EVERY AUTHENTICALLY PUNK ENOUGH WHEN I WAS YOUNG. BUT I THINK I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE IN MY LATER YEARS. CHEERS R ONCHASE ASKED: SOME OF YOUR WORK IS DEEPLY THOUGHTFUL. WHAT’S YOUR MOTIVATION? MY MOTIVATION IS FULFILL ANY POTENTIAL I HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE BEAUTY TO THE WORLD BEFORE I DIE. CHEERS R HENRYKLOSS ASKED: DEAR RICK, WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO DO MODEL ON MODEL?THANK YOU, HENRY I’M GONNA GIVE YOU A PRESS RELEASE THAT MIGHT ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE… DON’T WORRY, I WROTE IT, NOT A PR PERSON… THIS WOMEN’S SPRING COLLECTION IS ENTITLED CYCLOPS– A MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURE, FORMIDABLE, WITH FOCUSED VISION. WHO AMONG US WOULDN’T APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF DESCRIPTION? IN THE SPRING MEN’S COLLECTION, WHICH SHARES THE SAME NAME, THAT FOCUSED VISION WAS PROPULSIVE AND AGGRESSIVE. WHEN APPLIED TO WOMEN, I SEE THAT FOCUSED VISION BEING MORE ABOUT NOURISHMENT, SISTERHOOD/MOTHERHOOD AND REGENERATION; WOMEN RAISING WOMEN, WOMEN BECOMING WOMEN AND WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN– A WORLD OF WOMEN I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT AND CAN ONLY ATTEMPT TO AMUSE IN MY OWN SMALL WAY. STRAPS CAN BE ABOUT RESTRAINT BUT HERE THEY ARE ALL ABOUT SUPPORT AND CRADLING. STRAPS HERE BECOME LOVING RIBBONS. STURDY SANDALS PROVIDE A STEADY BASE FOR LIGHT-AS-AIR SHIFTS. TUNICS AND BOXERS ARE TOPPED WITH CRISPLY CUTAWAY COATS WITH NARROW, SHARPLY DEFINED SHOULDERS. SLEEVES ON THE COATS ARE RIPPED OFF OR CAN BE REMOVED TO DRIFT BEHIND THE BARE ARM LIKE A CAPE. AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF ADDRESSING THE PURSUIT OF THE ILLUSION OF CONTROL WITH GEOMETRIC MOTIFS AND CUTS THAT BELONG IN A CONCRETE BRUTALIST UTOPIA, THIS COLLECTION UNABASHEDLY COLLAPSES INTO WALLOWING SENSUALITY WITH SWIRLING AND DRIPPING GLOBS OF WASHED SILK GAZAR AND CLOQUE THAT POINT MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF AN ART NOUVEAU LANDSCAPE. FISTFULS OF SILK ORGANZA AND RAW CANVAS ARE TWISTED AND ABSTRACTEDLY DRAPED INTO SOMETHING AS CLOSE TO FLORAL AS I’LL PROBABLY EVER GET. ALL THIS ORGANIC LIMPNESS IS COUNTERED WITH THE CLASSIC RIGOR OF SIMPLE FLIGHT JACKETS, HOODED WINDBREAKERS AND SLEEVELESS BIKERS ALL IN VARYING WEIGHTS OF BLACK LEATHER AND A METALLIC FABRIC THAT I CHOSE FOR ITS SEMBLANCE TO SOMETHING JOHN CHAMBERLAIN WOULD HAVE MADE ONE OF HIS CRUMPLED STEEL SCULPTURES OUT OF. LEATHER IS ALSO TRANSPARENT, USING A PROCESS THAT PRESERVES THE LEATHER BUT STOPS SHORT OF DYEING IT. IT’S THEN WAXED IN A PROCEDURE SIMILAR TO DRUM SKINS. THIS PROCESS IS ALSO APPLIED TO SNAKESKIN TO CREATE A WEIRD ORGANZA/HIDE EFFECT. THE MUSIC FOR THE SHOW IS UNKLE’S ARRANGEMENT OF ‘THIS LAND’– THE THEME FROM THE MOVIE ‘EXODUS’– A SONG I USE HERE AS A REFLECTION ON THE TIMELESSLY FEMALE WAY OF PROTECTING AND NURTURING A TRIBE, SUNG LIVE BY VOCAL POWERHOUSE ESKA. THE-GATSBY-SYNDROME ASKED: MR. OWENS, I LOVE YOUR BRAND AND DESIGNS BUT I’M JUST A TYPICAL 20 SOMETHING. SHOULD I ASPIRE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD YOUR CLOTHES OR JUST BE FASHIONABLE AND HUNGRY LIKE A REAL ARTIST? BE A HUNGRY REAL ARTIST. CHEERS R NNAMEDAD ASKED: HEY WHAT’S FOR DINNER TODAY MAYBE A CHEESEBURGER CHEERS R ANONYMOUS ASKED: DO YOU WANNA SUCK ME OFF? DUNNO, D CK PIC PLEASE. CHEERS R NURLANBAYTOK ASKED: WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE STREETWEAR BRAND? I AM LOVING MARQUEZ ALMEIDA. WOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED STREET? CHEERS R FEELACOUPLETHINGSTWICE ASKED: AS THE “GODFATHER OF BRUTAL CHIC”, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE ESTABLISHED YOURSELF AND YOUR NAME IN THE FASHION WORLD. YOU BECAME ONE OF MY FAVORITE DESIGNERS AT AN EARLY AGE (THOUGH I’M NOW ONLY 18) BECAUSE YOU CREATE CLOTHES THAT IN ESSENCE ARE A FANTASTIC CONSONANCE OF SIMPLICITY AND DIE HARD CRAFTSMANSHIP. SO MY QUESTION IS THIS: WHAT HAS YOUR SUCCESS COME AT THE EXPENSE OF? IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT HAVE YOU HAD TO COMPROMISE TO BECOME THE SUCCESS YOU ARE TODAY? I HOPE TO LEARN AND NOT TO REPROBATE. I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT YOU DON’T HAVE TO MAKE A COMPROMISE. I DON’T THINK I HAD TO SACRIFICE ANYTHING. I WISH THE SAME FOR YOU. CHEERS R LACLOCHARD ASKED: HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS FOR DESIGNERS TO BE INVOLVED/ENJOY OTHER ARTISTIC CREATIONS LIKE MUSIC OR PHOTOGRAPHY? DOES THAT INFLUENCE YOU IN SOME WAY? DO YOU HAVE ANY FAVORITE MUSICIANS? THANK YOU! EVERYBODY GETS TO DO IT THEIR OWN WAY. BUT THE ARTISTS THAT I AM ENJOYING THE MOST THESE DAYS ARE CHRISTEENE AND DIVINE DAVID HOYLE. THEY ARE MY BEYONCÉ AND RHIANNA RESPECTIVELY. CHEERS R PATRICK44523 ASKED: WHAT KEEPS YOU MOTIVATED AND INSPIRED EVERY DAY? I LOOK AROUND. THERE ARE A MILLION EXAMPLES OF BEAUTY AND INSPIRATION AROUND US ALL THE TIME. YOU JUST HAVE TO EDIT A BIT BUT THERE’S PLENTY THERE. CHEERS R JUSTALITTLEMOUSEINTHEDOORWAY ASKED: WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON PLUS SIZE FASHION? FOR BOTH WOMEN AND MEN? I FEEL I HAVEN’T DONE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THEM. IT’S HARD TO CREATE A CORNER FOR PEOPLE THAT MIGHT NEVER COME TO ME FOR THAT BUT I’M TRYING TO FIND A WAY. CHEERS R DAMESONLY ASKED: GOOD MORNING RICK! FIRSTLY, YOU ARE A PHENOMENAL DESIGNER AND I LOVE YOUR WORK… AND YOUR EXPERTISE WITHIN THE FASHION AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIES… WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE AN ASPIRING CREATIVE PRODUCER (FOR FASHION, FILM, MUSIC) WHO LIVES IN TEXAS? I’D MAINLY WANT TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE CONCEPTS AND VISUAL/STYLE DIRECTION FOR FASHION SHOWS, MUSIC ARTISTS’ ALBUMS AND MUSIC VIDEOS, AND FILM. THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR ADVICE— THE BLACK DAME. BECOME BEST FRIENDS WITH CHRISTEENE AND BAMES WHO AE BOTH IN AUSTIN. CHEERS R FREAKI ASKED: WHAT’S YOUR PHILOSOPHY ON LIFE? HAPPINESS IS GRATITUDE FOR WHAT YOU HAVE. CHEERS R THESLIGHTLYTOXICHALLOWS ASKED: SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LIKE SNAPCHAT HAVE MADE EVENTS LIKE NEW YORK AND PARIS FASHION WEEK WAY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE AVERAGE PERSON. DO YOU THINK IT’S GOOD OR BAD FOR THE INDUSTRY FOR PLATFORMS LIKE THIS ONE TO MAKE THESE EVENTS LESS ‘ELITE’? HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK SOCIAL MEDIA HAS OR WILL BECOME TO THE FASHION WORLD? I THINK SOCIAL MEDIA IS A FASCINATING EVOLUTIONARY PHENOMENA AND DISAPPROVING OF IT WOULD BE LIKE INSISTING ON USING A ROTARY PHONE. LIKE ANY CHANGE IT’S GONNA HAVE AN AWKWARD START BUT IT’S INEVITABLE AND CRINGY AND FUN TO WATCH DEVELOP… CHEERS R I-TEND-TO-BE-ODD ASKED: I WANT TO BECOME A FASHION DESIGNER WHEN I GROW UP IS THERE ANYTHING I SHOULD LEARN TO DO BEFORE I TRY TO GO TO FASHION SCHOOL? YES! LEARN TO NOT TAKE ANYONE TOO SERIOUSLY AND LEARN TO LISTEN TO YOUR GUT. THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO LEARN— NOT JUST ACADEMICALLY. CHEERS R GREENWITHPURPLEPOKEADOTS ASKED: CAN BIG GIRLS STILL BE FASHIONABLE? I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT BECAUSE I AM NOT SKINNY I CAN’T BE FASHION FORWARD. I LOVE A BIG GIRL WHO OWNS IT UNAPOLOGETICALLY. ENJOY YOUR JUICINESS. LOVE R CLOSERTOPARIS ASKED: RICK, MY MAN… WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE? THE DEVILS BY KEN RUSSELL THANKS YOU GUYS, I HAD A REALLY NICE TIME. I APPRECIATE YOUR WARMTH AND SORRY I COULD ONLY ANSWER A HANDFUL OF QUESTIONS. I GOTTA GO TO A PERFORMANCE BY EUN-ME AHN, A KOREAN CHOREOGRAPHER WHO IS PERFORMING A 3 NIGHT SHOW IN PARIS AND TONIGHT IS THE LAST NIGHT OF THE TRILOGY. ALL MY BEST TO ALL OF YOU.

DESIGNER RICK OWENS SEEMS TO OCCUPY A SINGULAR SPACE IN THE FASHION WORLD, WHICH IS WHY WE CAN&#39;T STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM. MORE THAN 20 YEARS AFTER HE INTRODUCED HIS DRAPE-Y, GOTHIC VISION OF FASHION—ONE THAT WAS GENDER FLUID LONG BEFORE AESTHETIC WAS DE RIGUEUR—HIS DESIGNS ARE STILL SOMEHOW EQUAL PARTS APOCALYPTIC AND ALLURING. OWENS&#39; STORY IS FASHION LORE AT THIS POINT—FROM A SMALL TOWN IN CALIFORNIA, HE STARTED HIS LINE IN THE MID-&#39;90S WHILE LIVING AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE SKIPPING TOWN FOR PARIS—NOW THE DESIGNER IS MAKING A RETURN, OF SORTS, WITH HIS NEW STORE ON LABREA AVENUE IN HOLLYWOOD. &quot;HOLLYWOOD IS ABOUT SELF-INVENTION, AND THAT&#39;S WHERE I INVENTED MYSELF. SO OPENING A STORE THERE IS KIND OF A SPECIAL MOMENT,&quot; HE SAID VIA A PRESS RELEASE. THE SPACE, JUST SHY OF 1,500-SQUARE-FEET, IS A STARK CONCRETE STRUCTURE, A FORMER RIBBON FACTORY, THAT&#39;S BEEN &quot;GUTTED AND RECONFIGURED&quot; TO ACT AS THE PERFECT FRAME FOR HIS BRUTALIST WARES. &quot;MY GOAL WAS TO CREATE SOMETHING CECIL B. DEMILLE-WORTHY,&quot; THE DESIGNER SAID. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SPACE ARE THE FOG WALL (&quot;BASICALLY A SHALLOW GLASS TANK, COVERING A WALL FROM FLOOR TO CEILING, FILLED WITH A BILLOWING EJACULATION OF SMOKE EVERY 5 MINUTES&quot;) A SWIMMING POOL (THIS ONE A FLOOR-TO-CEILING TANK THAT RELEASES BUBBLES), AND AN OPEN COURTYARD—ALL REACTIONS TO THE SHOP&#39;S L.A. ENVIRONS. OWENS GRACIOUSLY ANSWERED A FEW QUESTIONS FOR US VIA EMAIL, ON HIS CATWALK SPECTACLES, HIS LOVE OF LOS ANGELES, AND HIS NAUGHTY MEMORIES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM WHEN HE CALLED IT HOME. DETAILS: WHAT MADE YOU FEEL LIKE NOW WAS THE RIGHT TIME TO OPEN A STORE IN LOS ANGELES, A CITY YOU FAMOUSLY LEFT BEHIND? RICK OWENS: OH NO, DOES IT SEEM LIKE I LEFT IT BEHIND? I JUST HAD TO GO TO WHERE THE FASHION FACTORIES ARE— I THINK L.A. IS FANTASTIC! THERE WERE A LOT OF PLACES TO OPEN A STORE IN THE WORLD AND WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE RIGHT SPACE THERE. BELIEVE ME, WE’VE BEEN LOOKING AROUND IN L.A. FOR A WHILE. DETAILS: WHAT&#39;S CHANGED THE MOST ABOUT THE CITY SINCE YOU LAST LIVED THERE? RICK OWENS: I HAVE NO CLUE, I HAVEN&#39;T BEEN BACK IN 14 YEARS. I’M AFRAID OF ALL THE TEMPTATIONS AND WONDERFUL DISTRACTIONS. DETAILS: HOW HANDS-ON ARE YOU IN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING YOUR STORES? RICK OWENS: DESIGNING STORES IS ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING ASPECTS OF WHAT I DO. WE CREATE DETAILED MODELS AND FURNITURE PROTOTYPES THAT WE INSTALL IN MY STUDIO TO TEST PROPORTIONS, TEXTURES, AND LIGHTING EFFECTS. I HAVE FLOOR PLANS ON MY IPHONE THAT I PORE OVER WHILE I’M AT THE GYM, I GET DAILY CONSTRUCTION SITE PICTURES. THERE ARE SOME STORES IN THE WORLD THAT I’VE NEVER BEEN TO PHYSICALLY, BUT I’VE LICKED EVERY SQUARE INCH CONCEPTUALLY. I DON&#39;T WORK WITH A COLLECTION DESIGN TEAM SO I’M IN THE STUDIO A LOT. I DECIDED A WHILE AGO THAT ANY SUCCESS WE HAD DEPENDED MORE ON ME CONCENTRATING ON THE CLOTHES, AND COUNTING ON MY BRILLIANT ARCHITECT [ANNA TUMAINI] AND DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS TO PROTECT AND CULTIVATE OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE. TRANSLATED: I DON&#39;T LIKE BEING ON PLANES ALL THE TIME. DETAILS: YOU MENTION EPIC BIBLICAL MOVIES AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE STORE’S INTERIOR—WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES? WHAT MOVIES INSPIRES YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS? RICK OWENS: I LOVE BIBLICAL EPICS FOR THEIR MIX OF CAMP (CLAUDETTE COLBERT AS CLEOPATRA!), GLAMOUR, AND SPIRITUAL EARNESTNESS—IN THAT ORDER. ALL THAT EXCESS IN BLACK AND WHITE HAS OBVIOUSLY INFORMED MY AESTHETIC: GRAY ROBES DRAGGING ON GRAY STAIRS LEADING TO GRAY TEMPLES FILLED WITH WHITE DOVES AND WHITE LILIES—THAT KIND OF STUFF. AND THE VILLAINS AND VILLAINESSES ARE SO WONDERFULLY OVER THE TOP. THERE IS A SCENE OF CHARLES LAUGHTON PLAYING THE LUTE WHILE ROME BURNS IN THE SIGN OF THE CROSS, AND A POLITICALLY INCORRECT COLISEUM ARENA SEQUENCE THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE TO PUT EVERYTHING I DO IN PERSPECTIVE. DETAILS: YOUR PAST FEW SHOWS HAVE FEATURED NOTABLE SPECTACLES ON THE RUNWAY—PEOPLE WEARING PEOPLE, EXPOSED PENISES—HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH THESE SPECIAL PERFORMANCES/EXPERIENCES? ARE YOU EVER SCARED THEY’LL UPSTAGE THE ACTUAL CLOTHING? RICK OWENS: SHOWS CAN BE ABOUT MORE THAN CLOTHES, THEY CAN BE ABOUT AN ETHOS OR A STATEMENT OF INTENT. I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO OFFER A MORE FULLY-RESOLVED, COMMITTED VISION THAT GOES BEYOND THE CLOTHES. A SHOW IS ABOUT PRESENTING A POINT OF VIEW. IT&#39;S THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A COMPOSITION THAT PRESENTS AN IDEAL OF BEAUTY NOT JUST IN MODELS IN MAKEUP AND HAIR AND IN DRESSES, BUT MAYBE ALSO BEAUTY IN MORALS, BEAUTY IN BEHAVIORAL ASPIRATION, BEAUTY IN WARMTH AND INCLUSIVENESS. I’M NOT SAYING THAT I’VE GOT A LOT OF NEW AGE ANSWERS, BUT I LIKE USING THE RUNWAY TO EXPRESS AS MUCH POSITIVE ENERGY AS I CAN GET OUT THERE WHILE I&#39;M ON EARTH. DETAILS: IN THE PRESS RELEASE FOR THE STORE, YOU MENTION THAT IT&#39;S ON LA BREA, DOWN THE STREET FROM A MEXICAN DRAG BAR CALLED PLAZA WHERE YOU SPENT &quot;A LOT OF LATE, BOOZY NIGHTS 20 YEARS AGO.&quot; ANY FUN MEMORIES OF THAT TIME THAT YOU CARE TO DIVULGE? RICK OWENS: I REMEMBER GETTING KICKED OUT FOR HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE UNDER THE TABLE ... DO PEOPLE DO THAT ANYMORE?

OWENS SPOKE TO T ABOUT ADMIRING WOMEN AND BEING CRITICAL TOWARD MEN, THE LEIGH BOWERY IMAGE THAT INSPIRED THE SHOW, AND HOW HE VIEWS MATTERS OF WELLNESS. HE ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS BY E-MAIL. WHY WAS NOW THE RIGHT TIME TO OPEN A STORE IN LOS ANGELES? THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON — WE’VE BEEN LOOKING AT SPACES IN L.A. FOR YEARS. THIS ONE JUST FELT RIGHT. IN YOUR NOTES FOR YOUR MOST RECENT PARIS SHOW, YOU DESCRIBED A TRIBUTE TO “SISTERHOOD/MOTHERHOOD AND REGENERATION; WOMEN RAISING WOMEN, WOMEN BECOMING WOMEN AND WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN — A WORLD OF WOMEN I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT AND CAN ONLY ATTEMPT TO AMUSE IN MY OWN SUPPORTING SMALL WAY.” WHY IS WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN IMPORTANT — AND PERSONAL — TO YOU? I HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT MY COLLECTIONS ARE PRETTY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL: I’M ADMIRATIVE AND LOVING WITH WOMEN, AND I’M AFRAID I’M HARSHLY CRITICAL OF MEN BECAUSE OF ALL THE SHORTCOMINGS I SEE IN MYSELF. MY WOMEN’S SHOWS USUALLY TRY TO ADDRESS NOBILITY AND GRACE, AND MEN’S SHOWS CAN SOMETIMES ADDRESS SELFISHNESS AND AGGRESSION A BIT TOO GLEEFULLY. I’LL HAVE TO WORK ON THAT. BUT I CONSIDER RUNWAY SHOWS MODERN RITUALS WHERE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER TO COLLECTIVELY CELEBRATE BEAUTY. IT’S JUST A HUMAN INSTINCT THAT HAS FOUND DIFFERENT ARENAS THROUGHOUT HISTORY. THE CLOTHES I SELL ARE RELICS OF THIS CEREMONY. FASHION SHOWS CAN CELEBRATE PHYSICAL BEAUTY, BUT THEY ARE ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE BEAUTIFUL ASPIRATIONS AND BEHAVIOR. I CERTAINLY DON’T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE MORALISTIC — BUT I’M JUST TRYING TO PUT AS MUCH GOOD ENERGY OUT THERE AS I CAN, WHILE I CAN, AND INDULGE IN ALL THE BEAUTY I CAN SCRAPE TOGETHER FROM EVERY CORNER OF OUR SHARED EXPERIENCE. WHERE DID YOU FIND THE GYMNASTS, AND HOW DID YOU CONCEIVE OF STAGING THE SHOW THAT WAY? PEOPLE HAVE ASKED, AND I’VE MENTIONED HAVING ADMIRED A LEIGH BOWERY IMAGE SHOT BY ANNIE LEIBOVITZ OF A BIRTHING PERFORMANCE WHERE HE CARRIED HIS WIFE SUSPENDED FROM STRAPS. IT WAS TENDER AND WEIRD, WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMBOS. I THOUGHT DOING IT WITH WOMEN MIGHT BE A NICE INTERPRETATION AND DEVELOPED OTHER POSES FROM THERE. I TOTALLY RIPPED HIM OFF AND AM SURPRISED THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL LIKE I WAS SECRETIVE ABOUT IT. NOT AT ALL — I THOUGHT IT WAS TOTALLY OBVIOUS. WE SCOUTED PROFESSIONAL GYMNASTS IN PARIS AND CAREFULLY FITTED THEM WITH GARMENTS THAT HAD HARNESSES INCORPORATED INTO THE DESIGN. THESE JACKETS ARE GOING TO BE SOLD WITH THE HARNESS BUCKLES INTACT AS SYMBOLIC REMNANTS OF THAT SHOW. I WAS HESITANT ABOUT SHOWING WOMEN UNDER STRAIN, BUT WE SHOW WOMEN AS SUGARED DOLLS ENOUGH. WOMEN CAN ALSO BE ATHLETES THAT GO TO ANOTHER PHYSICAL LEVEL TO ACHIEVE AN AESTHETIC IDEAL. AND THESE WOMEN DID THAT WITH A POWERFUL SERENITY, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL HOPE FOR IN OURSELVES. WHAT DOES BEING “WELL” MEAN TO YOU? AND WHAT DO YOU DO — DIET/EXERCISE/VITAMINS, SLEEP ETC. — TO ACHIEVE IT? I TRY TO ACCEPT MY CHARACTER LIMITATIONS AND WORK WITH WHAT I’VE GOT. I PACE MY ENERGY AND TRY TO MAINTAIN MYSELF PHYSICALLY, MOSTLY OUT OF VANITY. BUT ALSO JUST TO ENJOY THE PRIMAL PLEASURE OF BEING PHYSICALLY ALIVE. AND I DANCE EVERY DAY.

SUBURBAN DOMESTICITY HAS TAKEN OVER, SPRAWLING SUBURBAN DOMESTICITY,” WAILS RICK OWENS. IT IS A FEW DAYS AFTER THE DESIGNER’S LATEST SHOW, FOR HIS SPRING/SUMMER 2016 ‘CYCLOPS’ WOMENSWEAR COLLECTION. RICK OWENS IS ENTERTAINING AT HOME; THIS, NEEDLESS TO SAY, IS HARDLY THE HUB OF ‘SUBURBAN DOMESTICITY’ THAT HE SEEMS TO THINK IT IS. INSTEAD, THE EFFORTLESSLY ELEGANT YET COMPLETELY IDIOSYNCRATIC INTERIOR HAS UNDERGONE A SUDDEN CHANGE. THERE IS STILL THE SELF-DESIGNED FURNITURE THAT HAS BECOME SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF WHAT THE DESIGNER DOES – AND STARTED OFF ONLY AS A NECESSITY FOR HIS PERSONAL SPACES. THIS IS COMBINED WITH PIECES FROM HIS PRIVATE FURNITURE AND ART COLLECTION, PARTICULARLY THE LARGE ‘MELTING’ URN BY GEORGES HOENTSCHEL, WHICH IS SOMETHING OF AN EXQUISITELY DERANGED CENTREPIECE IN THE OWENS INTERIOR. THAT URN COULD ONCE BE FOUND AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE FORERUNNER OF THE MUSÉE DES ARTS DÉCORATIFS, DURING THE ART NOUVEAU EXHIBITION THAT TOOK PLACE THERE IN 1900. ITS COMPANION CAN PRESENTLY BE SEEN IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART. IN FACT, THE CHANGE TO THE INTERIOR HAS NOT COME FROM THE ADDITION OF INANIMATE OBJECTS, BUT RATHER IT HAS COME FROM ELSEWHERE: THE ANIMAL KINGDOM. AS WE TALK, WE ARE SUDDENLY CONFRONTED BY A ‘MENAGERIE’ OF ANIMALS; E.D. (IT STANDS FOR EATING DISORDER) A BEAGLE OWNED BY THE ARTIST SCARLETT ROUGE – RICK OWENS’ STEPDAUGHTER AND DAUGHTER OF MICHELE LAMY – AND HECKIE THE BLACK PUG-CROSS (CROSSED WITH GOD KNOWS WHAT), BELONGING TO THE AGENT JUSTINIAN KFOURY, HAVE STARTED TO HAVE SEX WITH EACH OTHER. THEY ARE BOTH MALE. “E.D. IS SUCH A SLOPPY BOTTOM, LOOK AT HECKIE FACE F CKING HIM!” EXCLAIMS RICK OWENS WITH SOME GLEE, BEFORE ADDING: “IF THIS WERE THE 70S, WE’D BE WATCHING PEOPLE DOING THAT. AND WE’D BE DOING COKE AND I’D BE AN INCREDIBLY GLAMOROUS FASHION DESIGNER. INSTEAD THIS IS… DOMESTICITY WITH DOGS F CKING.” THAT IS WHEN THE WAILING ABOUT ‘SPRAWLING SUBURBAN DOMESTICITY’ COMES IN. THE OTHER PART OF THE MENAGERIE, GAIA THE FEMALE BENGAL KITTEN, HAS WALKED AWAY IN DISGUST. “EVEN I AM DISGUSTED BY THE WAY THEY KEEP GOING AT IT,” SIGHS OWENS LATER. “AND THAT’S REALLY SAYING SOMETHING.” UNPROMPTED, THE DOGS HAD ‘GONE AT IT’ AGAIN FOR THE SHOOT THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS PIECE. BUT THERE IS A POINT TO ALL THE TALK OF DOGS F CKING AND CAT DISGUST. UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY, THERE HAD BEEN NO ANIMALS IN RICK OWENS’ HOME; NO BEES ON THE ROOF, NO BLACKBIRDS NESTING, NO BORROWED DOGS F CKING, NO BLACK MICE SCURRYING AND NO BENGAL CAT BROUGHT IN TO KILL SAID MICE. THIS SUDDEN DOMESTIC ONSLAUGHT HAS ACCOMPANIED A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING BY THE DESIGNER, SOMETHING THAT HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF IN A WARMER, LOOSER AND LESS CONTROLLED AESTHETIC – IT IS AN APPROACH THAT ALSO PERMEATES THE LATEST COLLECTION. IT IS A REALISATION BY RICK OWENS THAT HIS AESTHETIC HAS STARTED EMANATING FROM INFLUENCES ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE HE HAD INITIALLY PERCEIVED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. RATHER, THERE IS A RETURN TO THOSE THAT ORIGINALLY SHAPED HIS WORLDVIEW – THE OBJECTS, PEOPLE, THINGS AND IDEAS THAT HAVE SURROUNDED HIM DOMESTICALLY FOR MANY YEARS, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER. THE SENSUAL COLLAPSE OF ART NOUVEAU “WHEN I WAS DOING THIS COLLECTION, I REALISED THAT THINGS AROUND ME ARE NOT SEVERE, THEY ARE ART NOUVEAU,” SAYS THE DESIGNER. “ART NOUVEAU IS ABOUT BEAUTY, EMOTION AND SENSUALITY. BRUTALISM HAS OFTEN BEEN RELATED TO WHAT I DO, BUT ART NOUVEAU IS WHAT I HAVE AROUND ME. AT THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER, I STARTED OFF WITH AN IDEA OF COLLAPSE AND IT THEN BECAME THE FANTASY OF PRECISION, OF CONTROL AND GEOMETRY. AND NOW IT HAS BECOME COLLAPSE AGAIN – BUT THE SENSUAL COLLAPSE OF CORRUPTION.” STRENGTH THROUGH ‘SENSUAL COLLAPSE’ COULD BE SEEN TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN RICK OWENS’ LATEST COLLECTION AND SHOW WITH THE MOTIF OF WOMEN CARRYING OTHER WOMEN. A MIXTURE OF GYMNASTS, ACROBATS AND CONTORTIONISTS TOOK PART; THEY WERE BOTH THE WOMEN CARRYING AND THE WOMEN BEING CARRIED – THE REGULAR MODELS WERE FREE OF THIS LITERAL BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY. THE ORIGINAL INSPIRATION HAD COME FROM LEIGH BOWERY ‘GIVING BIRTH’ TO HIS WIFE NICOLA BOWERY ON STAGE – A SIMILAR HARNESS WAS WORN IN THAT PERFORMANCE – BUT WITH THE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS BECOMING TWO WOMEN, TOGETHER WITH THE MOOD MADE LESS JOKEY, GROTESQUE AND HYSTERICAL THROUGH THE ELEGIAC TONE OF THE LIVE MUSIC, SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN FEELING AND EMOTION WAS ACHIEVED BY RICK OWENS’ SHOW. “I LOVE JIMMY SCOTT’S SONG EXODUS, AND I HAD ASKED JAMES LAVELLE IF WE COULD RE-DO IT WITH ESKA,” EXPLAINS THE DESIGNER. “I KEPT TELLING HIM TO MAKE IT MORE RAW AND LESS LUSH, I LIKED THAT FOCUS ON HER VOICE.” AND IT WAS ESKA’S LIVE PERFORMANCE WITH HER REPEATED REFRAIN OF &quot;THIS LAND IS MINE&quot; THAT GAVE THE SHOW AN ADDITIONAL, HAUNTING POWER. &quot;MORE RAW AND LESS LUSH,&quot; WAS ALSO SOMETHING THAT COULD BE WITNESSED IN THE AESTHETIC OF THE COLLECTION ITSELF. STRIPPED BACK IN ITS SIMPLICITY AND CLASSICISM, YET ODDLY, MELTINGLY LANGUID AND SENSUAL, THE COLLECTION FELT LIKE A SIMILAR COMPOSITION OF FREEDOM AND RESTRAINT. “I SUPPOSE A LOT OF THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT THE SHOW BY NOW,” CONTINUES OWENS. “BUT FOR ME IT WAS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO CONFLICT. CONFLICT IS ETERNAL, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE; I WAS USING THE IDEA OF GRACE UNDER PRESSURE AS A MOTIF. IT WASN’T REALLY CRITICAL – YOU SOMETIMES RUN THE RISK OF APPEARING POMPOUS IF YOU ARE. IT WAS NOT THAT SOPHISTICATED IN A POLITICAL WAY; IT WAS ABOUT EMOTION. AND OF COURSE A SHOW IS NOT GOING TO STOP CONFLICT; THAT’S A PART OF LIFE AND LIFE ISN’T FAIR. IT’S FINE TO SAY IT WAS RIDICULOUS, THAT’S FINE. BUT I AM DOING SHOWS WHERE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN ‘RED LIPS.’” IN HIS SHOWS AND COLLECTIONS, RICK OWENS OFTEN PUTS WOMEN ON A PEDESTAL – OR, IN THIS CASE, A HARNESS – TO PERHAPS AN OVERLY IDEALISTIC DEGREE. “I THINK I AUTOMATICALLY GET POLITE WITH WOMEN,” HE SAYS. “WITH THE MEN’S SHOWS IT’S AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL; ABOUT WHAT D CKS MEN ARE, HOW AGGRESSIVE THEY ARE. WOMEN HAVE A MYSTIQUE FOR ME; I CERTAINLY CAN’T PROFESS TO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT, BUT THERE ARE THE THINGS THAT I ADMIRE.” DERANGED DOMESTICITY IT IS PERHAPS TWO OF THE WOMEN THAT ARE CLOSEST TO RICK OWENS DOMESTICALLY, HIS WIFE MICHELE LAMY AND HIS STEPDAUGHTER SCARLETT ROUGE, WHO COULD BE SEEN TO HAVE MADE THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS WOMEN. YET WHEN THE IDEA OF MOTHER AND DAUGHTER IS BROUGHT UP IN REFERENCE TO THE SHOW, AND WHETHER IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH MICHELE AND SCARLETT, THE DESIGNER LAUGHS, “THAT WOULD BE MORE LIKE THE JOAN CRAWFORD SCENE ON THE FLOOR!” OF COURSE HE IS REFERRING TO A NOTORIOUS TAKE FROM MOMMIE DEAREST. NEVERTHELESS, DERANGED DOMESTICITY SEEMS TO BE THE BIGGEST DEFINING INFLUENCE ON THE DESIGNER AT THE MOMENT, AND MAYBE IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO SCARLETT ROUGE TO NARRATE A VERY TELLING STORY ABOUT AN EARLY INCARNATION OF THE UNCONVENTIONAL OWENS-LAMY HOUSEHOLD IN LOS ANGELES. “AS MUCH AS MICHELE IS A HARD ASS MOTHER, SHE IS ALSO A GREAT ONE,” SAYS SCARLETT ROUGE. “WHEN RICK MOVED INTO OUR HOUSE HE BROUGHT WITH HIM A BIG, BLACK DILDO. ONE DAY I FOUND IT, TOOK IT OUTSIDE, AND MY FRIENDS AND I STARTED THROWING IT AROUND THE POOL! WE WERE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD. AT THAT TIME WE ALSO HAD A FRENCH LODGER – I’VE FORGOTTEN HIS NAME – HE DISCOVERED US THROWING THIS DILDO AROUND AND I WAS IN TROUBLE. WHEN MY MOTHER GOT HOME, I REMEMBER I WAS SAT PLAYING WITH MY DOLL’S HOUSE AS HE TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I REMEMBER HER REACHING FOR A CIGARETTE AND HER JUST SAYING ‘WHAT’S YOUR POINT?’ I THOUGHT, &#39;YES! THAT’S MY MOTHER.’ AS MUCH AS SHE IS CRAZY, SHE’S AMAZING. AFTER THAT NO KID WAS ALLOWED TO COME TO OUR HOUSE.” HOW TIMES CHANGE – EXCEPT THEY DON’T. AS WELL AS ALL THE UNCONVENTIONALITY, THERE IS STILL ALL THE WARMTH AND FREEDOM OF OWENS’ DOMESTIC SET-UP IN PARIS TODAY AS THERE WAS IN LA. PARIS WAS ALSO THE PLACE THAT RICK OWENS ALWAYS DREAMED OF GOING TO WHEN GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA – NOT BECAUSE OF FASHION BUT BECAUSE OF LITERATURE. AND IT IS STILL THE IDEAS THE DESIGNER LEARNED BY READING FRENCH LITERATURE AT THAT TIME, THAT GUIDE HIS ABIDING QUEST FOR PERFECTION IN WHAT HE DOES TODAY. “I AM FED UP WITH STUFF THAT ISN’T PERFECT,” HUFFS OWENS. “AFFECTING CASUALNESS IS EVERY BIT AS PRECIOUS AS BEING PRECIOUS AND I AM GOING TO BE AS REFINED AND ELEGANT AS I CAN. I AM GOING TO MAKE MY INTERIORS AS PERFECT AS THEY CAN POSSIBLY BE. AT THE FACTORY I NEED IT TO BE EXACTLY THE WAY I WANT IT TO BE, SO WHY SHOULD I COMPROMISE ELSEWHERE? IT IS VERY A REBOURS, VERY JEAN DES ESSEINTES, ITS HERO AND MY HERO. I PLAN TO SHUT MYSELF AWAY MORE AND MORE AND MORE… AND YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DESIGNERS LOSING TOUCH WITH REALITY, LIKE THAT’S A BAD THING – I PLAN TO LOSE TOUCH WITH REALITY. AND THE MORE I LOSE TOUCH WITH REALITY, THE BETTER I’LL GET… I THINK.” LATER HE REMOVES A CUSHION FROM THE COUCH THAT SEEMS TO BE COVERED IN DOG CUM. THE OFFENDING ITEM IS PLACED OUTSIDE AND OUT OF SIGHT ON THE TERRACE.

IT HARDLY FEELS LIKE THE CENTER OF PARIS, SITTING IN RICK OWENS’ QUIET TERRACE AS THE RUSTLING LEAVES MAKE THE DAPPLED SUNLIGHT DANCE ON THE PALE FLOORS AND WALLS OF THE ALL-CONCRETE SPACE. CALM AS IT IS—EVEN HIS USUALLY PLAYFUL KITTEN GAIA IS LULLED INTO A NAP—OWENS INSISTS THAT DESPITE ITS APPARENT AUSTERITY, HIS LIVE/WORK SPACE IS A BIT CHAOTIC. “THIS HOUSE IS ALWAYS UNDER CONSTRUCTION,” HE LAUGHS. “MICHELE [HIS WIFE] AND I USED TO ARGUE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT DROVE ME CRAZY, BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT SHE LOVES THE PROCESS. SO I DECIDED THAT I SHOULD JUST RELAX AND APPRECIATE THE RIDE.” AND WHAT A RIDE IT CONTINUES TO BE FOR OWENS, WHO OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES HAS CONSTRUCTED A CREATIVE UNIVERSE—THE CENTER OF WHICH IS THE FIVE-STORY HOME IN THE 7THARRONDISSEMENT WHERE HE AND WIFE MICHELE LAMY LIVE, WORK, CREATE, AND COLLABORATE. OWENS REFERS TO IT AS A “CREATIVE COMMUNE,” SPEARHEADED BY HIS CAPTIVATING WIFE. “I HAVE ENOUGH CONTROL OVER CERTAIN AREAS, SO I HAVE TO ACCEPT THE WONDERFUL CHAOS AT HOME,” HE MUSES. THE CONTROL HE’S REFERRING TO IS HIS NAMESAKE LINE, WHICH LAUNCHED IN 1994 AND HAS GROWN INTO A GLOBAL BUSINESS WHILE REMAINING INDEPENDENT—SOMETHING OF A RARITY IN TODAY’S FASHION CLIMATE. WITH AUTONOMY COMES A CANDID CREATIVITY SEEN IN ALL FACETS OF THE BUSINESS. JUST DAYS BEFORE OUR MEETING, WE ATTENDED THE RICK OWENS SPRING 2016 SHOW, WHERE WOMEN WALKED THE RUNWAY WITH OTHER WOMEN STRAPPED TO THEIR BODIES IN STRENUOUS, ACROBATIC POSITIONS. “I KNOW THERE’S A LEVEL OF ABSURDITY IN WHAT I DID,” OWENS SAYS, WITH HIS TYPICAL RELAXED CALIFORNIA INFLECTION. “FASHION, TO ME, ISN’T REALLY FUN UNLESS THERE’S SOMETHING A LITTLE BONKERS ABOUT IT.” HIS UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH HAS EARNED HIM A TRIBE OF DEVOTEES, AND WHILE THEY INCLUDE MAJOR INFLUENCERS LIKE A$AP ROCKY AND CARINE ROITFELD, FRINGE CULTURE REMAINS CLOSE TO HIS HEART. HENCE, HE ONLY GIFTS TO A SELECT FEW, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE ARTISTS CHRISTEENE VALE AND DAVID HOYLE—“TWO OF THE MOST EXTREME CREATURES I KNOW…MY BEYONCÉ AND RIHANNA.” BELOW, OWENS DISCUSSES THE EXPRESSION OF BEAUTY, HIS REPUTATION AS THE “GOTH DESIGNER,” AND HIS “SUPERNATURAL” WIFE. JUST DON’T CALL HER A MUSE. THE WINDOW: YOUR SHOWS TEND TO MAKE A LASTING IMPRESSION. TELL ME ABOUT THE CONCEPT BEHIND YOUR SPRING/SUMMER 2016 PRESENTATION. RICK OWENS: IT SURPRISES ME THAT PEOPLE ARE SO SURPRISED! THIS IS A SOPHISTICATED AUDIENCE, SO IT TRULY SURPRISES ME WHEN I CAN STILL SHOCK. SOMEBODY SAID IN THEIR REVIEW OF THE SHOW HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT WAS WATCHING WOMEN’S’ FACES TURN RED WHILE UPSIDE DOWN. I TOTALLY GET IT. THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN OF MINE. I HATE IT WHEN DESIGNERS MAKE WOMEN DO STUFF ON STAGE THAT LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE, LIKE EXTREME SHOES OR HOLDING SOMETHING AWKWARD. SO, I WAS VERY CONSCIOUS OF THAT, AS WELL AS OF THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN THAT SOME PEOPLE COULD ACCUSE ME OF, WHICH TO ME IS FUNNY. PEOPLE ARE SO SQUEAMISH AND POLITICALLY CORRECT THAT IT’S FUN TO PUSH THOSE BUTTONS. ANYBODY THAT HAS FOLLOWED WHAT I’VE DONE KNOWS THAT ANYTHING THAT I DO IS SINCERELY RESPECTFUL OF WOMEN. I CAN’T HELP BUT TEASE PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET A LITTLE TOO PRUDISH. AND THESE WOMEN WERE PROFESSIONALS… THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL EXERTION, BUT, YES, WE WERE DOING THIS WITH WOMEN WHO WERE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES. BEAUTY IS ABOUT EXERTION SOMETIMES. LET’S TAKE THE CALLOUSES ON BALLET DANCER’S FEET—IS IT OKAY FOR THEM TO EXERT ALL THAT BEAUTY AS LONG AS WE DON’T HAVE TO SEE THE SUFFERING? THAT’S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. SO, IS EXERTION BEHIND THE EXPRESSION OF BEAUTY SUPPOSED TO BE INVISIBLE? THAT REVIEW MADE ME THINK ABOUT THAT. BUSINESS OF FASHION SAID THE SHOW CHALLENGED FASHION ORTHODOXY. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU SOUGHT TO DO? I DID. I AM TRYING TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE WORLD. I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY: LOOK THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF EXPRESSING BEAUTY, AND SO MANY DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONS THAT WE CAN CREATE. I THINK THE FASHION WORLD CAN BE SO STRICT AND NARROW SOMETIMES, AND I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OTHER PROPOSALS. THEY AREN’T MANIFESTOS—I’M NOT SAYING, ‘YOU’RE WRONG, I’M RIGHT.’ I’M SAYING, ‘HERE’S ANOTHER OPTION.’ DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR MESSAGE CHANGES SEASON TO SEASON, OR IS THERE A LARGER MESSAGE YOU SEEK TO COMMUNICATE? I THINK THE MAIN MESSAGE IS THAT I’M MAKING COMPOSITIONS THAT I THINK ARE POETIC, AND I HOPE YOU DO TOO. IT’S VARIATIONS ON THE SAME THEME, WHICH IS ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION. IT’S EMOTIONS THAT WE CAN ALL CONNECT TO AND RELATE TO. ANYONE WHO CREATES SOMETIMES IS CREATING COMPOSITIONS OF WHAT’S RECOGNIZABLE, JUST IN A NEW WAY. I ALWAYS THINK OF HAIKU—A SIMPLE COMBINATION OF THREE ELEMENTS THAT, WHEN COMBINED, SAYS SOMETHING NEW. THE ELEMENTS THEMSELVES AREN’T NEW, JUST THE COMBINATION. SOMETIMES I HIT THE TARGET, AND SOMETIMES I DON’T. MY GOAL EVERY SEASON IS TO CREATE A NEW COMPOSITION WITH THE THINGS I LOVE AND APPRECIATE. IT’S ALSO ABOUT PUTTING SOMETHING POSITIVE OUT INTO THE WORLD. FOR INSTANCE, WITH THIS SHOW, THERE’S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RIDICULE, AND PEOPLE ARE UNSURE—BUT IT GOT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS MESSAGE OF WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN. THAT’S PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I WANTED TO START WITH MY SHOW, RATHER THAN JUST WHAT A CUTE SHORT SKIRT AND BOMBER JACKET. WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A CONCEPTUAL DESIGNER OR PRACTICAL DESIGNER? WELL, EVERYTHING’S FOR SALE. I’M NOT MAKING STUFF FOR RUNWAY ONLY. EVERYTHING WE DO IS A PROPOSAL FOR THE REAL WORLD. DON’T GET ME STARTED—I ALWAYS RESENTED ABOUT FASHION THESE MEN CREATING THESE FLOATS FOR WOMEN TO COME OUT IN ON THE RUNWAY, AND THEN THEY COME OUT IN JEANS AND T-SHIRT AT THE END. I FEEL LIKE IT’S RIDICULOUS TO CREATE THIS FANTASY OF A WOMAN THAT CLEARLY DOESN’T EXIST IF THEY DON’T BELIEVE IN IT. THAT MAKES ME CRAZY. EVERYTHING I PROPOSE IS FOR REAL LIFE. DON’T GET ME WRONG, I UNDERSTAND FANTASY—BUT WE CAN MAKE THAT FANTASY AN EVERYDAY THING. I DO MY BEST TO MAKE THEM MEET. YOU’RE A CALIFORNIA NATIVE BUT HAVE BEEN WORKING FROM PARIS FOR 14 YEARS NOW. HOW HAS THAT CHANGED THINGS? I THINK THERE’S AN AMERICAN SLEAZE THAT I BRING TO PARIS THAT KIND OF WORKS FOR ME. THERE’S A SENSE OF EASE IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE U.S., EVERYTHING IS QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD, WHEREAS EUROPE IS ABOUT LAYERS AND LAYERS OF HISTORY. YOU CAN EVEN SEE IT IN THE LANGUAGE—THE WAY YOU FORM A SENTENCE IN FRENCH VERSUS THE WAY YOU FORM A SENTENCE IN ENGLISH. AMERICANS WILL ALWAYS FIND THE STRAIGHTEST LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B, WHICH CAN BE QUITE BLUNT—ESPECIALLY TO EUROPEANS SOMETIMES. I’VE BROUGHT A FASCINATION WITH EUROPEAN COMPLEXITY TO AN AMERICAN BLUNTNESS, AND IT’S KIND OF MY SHTICK. REGARDING L.A., I REALLY THINK ABOUT THE EXPANSE OF SPACE. WHEN YOU’RE BORN WITH THOSE PROPORTIONS, YOU CARRY THAT WITH YOU. AS FOR PARIS, I LOVE IT—ALTHOUGH I DON’T ALWAYS FEEL TOTALLY WELCOME. IT CAN BE A BIT ALOOF HERE, WHICH IS FINE BECAUSE I AM NOT THAT GREGARIOUS, SO I DON’T NEED TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY. JUST RECENTLY, I’VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT ENVIRONMENT, AND WOULD MY COLLECTIONS BE DIFFERENT IF I HAD, SAY, A ROTHKO IN MY OFFICE? REALLY IT’S JUST ABOUT EXCELLENCE AND HAVING REALLY REFINED EXCELLENCE AROUND YOU ALL THE TIME. WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT, I WAS ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, AND MY REFERENCES WERE MUCH MORE RAW. ARE YOU STILL CONNECTED TO THE FRINGE CULTURE YOU WERE A PART OF IN L.A.? I DO STILL SPEAK TO A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE. THE ARTISTS THAT I APPRECIATE THE MOST ARE THE MOST FRINGE THAT I CAN FIND. THERE’S THIS PERFORMANCE ARTIST FROM TEXAS CALLED CHRISTEENE VALE AND THEN THERE’S DAVID HOYLE BASED IN LONDON—THEY ARE THE MOST EXTREME CREATURES THAT I KNOW. THEY AREN’T HUGE MEGA STARS, BUT THEY’RE EXTREME ARTISTS AND I WANT TO SUPPORT THAT TRANSGRESSIVE ENERGY. WHEN I LOOK AT THE ARTS THESE DAYS, I’M THINKING, YOU KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HORRIFYING ME AND SHOCKING ME, AND YOU’RE NOT! STEP IT UP! PEOPLE CONSIDER YOU QUITE GOTHIC AND DARK, BUT YOU OFTEN DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS CAMP, OR I EVEN ONCE READ YOU SAID, A “TEENAGE ANGST WITHOUT THE ANGST.” HOW DO THE DARKNESS AND THE CAMPINESS FIT TOGETHER? I THINK THE GOTH THING IS MORE ABOUT THE ART NOUVEAU INFLUENCE, BUT IT’S JUST AN EASY THING TO SAY. I MEAN I GET IT—THE LONG, BLACK HAIR! I WAS GOTH WHEN I WAS A KID, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE. THERE IS AN ADOLESCENT SIDE TO IT THAT ISN’T FLATTERING WHEN YOU’RE A 52-YEAR OLD MAN, BUT I GUESS I BROUGHT THAT ON MYSELF! I THINK IF I WAS JUST A ‘GOTH DESIGNER,’ I WOULDN’T HAVE LASTED THIS LONG, BUT PEOPLE KNOW THAT. IF ANYTHING, MAYBE I’VE CHANGED THE PERCEPTION OF GOTH AND MADE IT MORE GLAMOROUS OR SOPHISTICATED. TELL US ABOUT MICHELE. DO YOU CONSIDER HER YOUR MUSE? MICHELE IS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE. SHE HATES BEING CALLED A MUSE, BECAUSE IT MAKES HER SEEM KIND OF SUPERFLUOUS, AND SHE’S NOT. SHE GETS BORED BEING MY MUSE! SHE HAS NO PATIENCE WITH A LOT OF THINGS. SHE HAS GENUINE EMOTIONAL URGENCY. RECENTLY, SHE’S BEEN CREATING THESE EVENTS ON BARGES WHERE SHE HOSTS VARIOUS CREATIVE PEOPLE. IT’S BASICALLY THESE SALONS WHERE SHE CROSS-POLLINATES DIFFERENT PEOPLE—MUSICIANS, CHEFS, ARTISTS—AND BREEDS NEW CREATIVITY. I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS FOR WHAT SHE DOES, MAYBE A HOSTESS. REALLY IT’S MORE OF A SALONIST—SOMEONE WHO CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE TO CONNECT. LIKE GERTRUDE STEIN AND THE CUBISTS—YOU CAN’T SEPARATE IT. AS A SALONIST AND A PATRON, GERTRUDE STEIN HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE. WOMEN OFTEN PLAY THIS INTERESTING, SECRET ROLE. MICHELE HARNESSES PEOPLE AND FORCES PEOPLE TO MAKE SOMETHING. DOES SHE DO THAT FOR YOU? OF COURSE, MYSELF INCLUDED. BUT MICHELE WOULDN’T HAVE STAYED WITH ME IF SHE COULD MANIPULATE ME. WE ENDED UP BEING A GOOD MATCH BECAUSE WE CAN’T CONTROL EACH OTHER AT ALL. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN BORED WITH ME IN FIVE MINUTES IF SHE COULD HAVE CONTROLLED ME. SHE IS A HANDFUL! WE BOTH ARE. SHE IS AN AMAZING, MAGICAL CREATURE—THERE’S ALMOST SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL ABOUT HER. I CAN’T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT HER. SO HOW DOES SHE INFLUENCE YOUR WORK? SHE’S A HUGE BULLS IT DETECTOR, AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT HER IS THAT SHE HAS NO FILTER. I NEVER SHOW HER A COLLECTION UNTIL IT’S FINISHED, IT WOULDN’T WORK. I COULDN’T DO IT! HER REACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT I HAVE TO FOCUS ON EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO MAKE IT WORK. IT’S NOT AN EASY PROCESS TO NOT THINK ABOUT A STAFF OF 200 PEOPLE IN THE SHOWROOM – I CAN’T LET THAT BE A FACTOR. SOMETIMES, I AM AMAZED THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON THE MOST FLEETING NOTION OF ME COMING UP WITH THE RIGHT IDEA THAT PEOPLE WILL RESPOND WELL TO. IT’S SUCH A CRAZY GAMBLE! IF I START THINKING ABOUT IT TOO MUCH, I’LL GET NERVOUS—SO, I DON’T! DO YOU STILL FEEL LIKE A SMALL COMPANY? WILL YOU REMAIN INDEPENDENT FOREVER? I TOTALLY FEEL LIKE A SMALL COMPANY. THERE WAS A TIME WHERE I WORRIED ABOUT THIS POSITION, BUT NOW EVEN IF THIS COMPANY FALLS APART AND I START MAKING HORRIBLE COLLECTIONS, I DON’T THINK I EVER HAVE TO SELL IT. INDEPENDENCE IS SUCH AN ASSET. SO FEW ARE ALLOWED TO BE ANYMORE. I HAVE FANTASTIC PARTNERS—AN INCREDIBLE CEO AND DISTRIBUTION DIRECTOR. THEY ARE SO TALENTED THAT THEY COULD HAVE STEERED ANYONE RIGHT. I’M SO THANKFUL TO HAVE SUCH A GREAT MARRIAGE—BECAUSE IT IS LIKE A MARRIAGE. SOME DESIGNERS HAVE TO GO TO 20 DIFFERENT HOUSES BEFORE THEY’RE IN ONE THAT CLICKS. HOW DOES YOUR PERSONAL FASHION FIT INTO YOUR DAILY LIFE? IS IT SOMETHING YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND GET DRESSED? I’M ALMOST MORE INTO IT NOW THAN EVER. I FEEL LIKE AS I GET OLDER, I’M REFINING WHAT I DO AND FINDING MORE WAYS TO MAKE MYSELF BETTER. I’M NOT SURE WHY THAT’S HAPPENING NOW. THERE’S A SENSE OF MOMENTUM THAT I’M REALLY ENJOYING. I DON’T HAVE THE PRESSURES THAT OTHER DESIGNERS DO; I DON’T HAVE TO ANSWER TO A BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR THING IS MORE LIKE BEING IN A BAND ON THE ROAD—IT REALLY IS ABOUT FUN! IT’S THE NICE RESPONSE THAT KEEPS US GOING. IT MOTIVATES ME AND MAKES ME WANT TO DO BETTER. LOOKING BACK AND SEEING THAT THE THREAD MAKES SENSE—THE STORY I’VE BEEN TELLING ALL THESE YEARS. I THINK ABOUT HOW TO KEEP IT GOING WITHOUT IT GETTING STALE. I LOOK AROUND AT SOME DESIGNERS WHO HAD A MOMENT OF GLORY AND WHO WERE COMPLETELY RELEVANT AT A CERTAIN MOMENT IN TIME, AND SUDDENLY THINGS CHANGE AND THEY AREN’T RELEVANT! SO, SHOULD I BE A SLAVE TO PEOPLE’S RESPONSE OR SAY F CK IT AND JUST DO WHAT I WANT TO DO?! WHICH WINS? I DON’T KNOW! PEOPLE RESPONDING WELL FEELS GOOD, AND IT’S ADDICTIVE. I DON’T KNOW HOW IT WILL FEEL IN 10 YEARS. YOU NEED THE RESPONSE AND THE SALES TO SURVIVE. IT MAY NOT LAST FOREVER, BUT I’LL ENJOY IT WHILE I CAN. WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN 10 YEARS? I HAVE NO CLUE. I NEVER EXPECTED ANY OF THIS! IF I CAN KEEP GOING AT THIS RATE, I AM SO SATISFIED. I LEARN EVERY DAY. I KNOW SO MUCH MORE NOW THAN I DID 10 YEARS AGO, AND I’LL KNOW MORE IN 10 YEARS. AND THERE’S ALWAYS MORE TO LEARN—IT’S SO MOTIVATING.

MAYBE I&#39;M TOO LITERAL. OR MAYBE I HAVE THIS PICTURE BECAUSE I SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATE FORWARD-THINKING WITH RICK OWENS THAT, IN THE NEARLY 20 YEARS THAT I HAVE KNOWN HIM, OWENS HAS BECOME, FOR ME, A METONYM FOR AVANT-GARDE-NESS, FILLING THE TERM WITH ALL OF HIS SLOUCHY DRUID AESTHETICS AND MONKISH ETHICS.&nbsp; &nbsp; IN LIFE AND WORK, OWENS IS SO FAR OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM, AHEAD OF THE PACK, THAT HIS REGULAR DISPATCHES FROM THE FRINGE, IN THE FORM OF SEMIANNUAL FASHION SHOWS, CAN SEEM LIKE TRANSMISSIONS FROM AN (INCREDIBLY LUXURIOUS) ALIEN CIVILIZATION&mdash;AND GIVE US HOPE FOR THE ROAD AHEAD. THIS IS NOT BY CHANCE&mdash;NOTHING IS, IN HIS OBSESSIVELY EDITED WORLD; NOT HIS CLOTHES, NOT THE FURNITURE HE DESIGNS, NOT HIS CUSTOM-MADE MARBLE TOILET. IN HIS FIVE-STORY MANSION IN PARIS, FORMERLY THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY (WHERE, BEFORE THE FURNITURE THEY MADE FOR THE PLACE HAD BEEN INSTALLED, HE AND HIS WIFE,&nbsp;MICH&Egrave;LE LAMY, CAMPED OUT IN THE EMPTY BUILDING, SLEEPING IN IMPROVISED TENTS MADE OF MINK STOLES), OWENS LIVES A LIFE OF ASCETIC DETACHMENT, AN ERASMUS OF THE LEFT BANK, CONSCIOUSLY PROTECTED BY AND ENCLOSED IN AN ADAMANTINE REGIMEN OF WORK AND EXERCISE. HE IS BOTH BUTTRESSED BY HIS SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS AND COLLABORATORS, AND INSULATED FROM THE DUMB-ASS DISTRACTIONS OF THE WORLD. &nbsp; WHETHER IT IS AN INDULGENCE OR PRIVATION, THIS MONASTIC DEVOTION SEEMS TO HAVE COME EARLY AND EASILY TO HIM. OWENS GREW UP IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA, IN A DUSTY PART OF THE WORLD, AND SOME OF HIS EARLIEST MEMORIES ARE OF THE MUSLIN ROBES OF THE LOCAL NUNS, DRAGGING IN THE DIRT BEHIND THEM AS THEY CLIMBED THE TOWN HILL. IN THE 1980S, AFTER MOVING TO LOS ANGELES, HE WORKED IN WAREHOUSES CUTTING PATTERNS FOR COMPANIES KNOCKING OFF LUXURY LINES. IN 1988, HE MET MICH&Egrave;LE AND WORKED WITH HER ON HER BRAND, LAMY, BEFORE LAUNCHING HIS OWN NAMESAKE LINE IN 1994. WHEN, IN 2002, OWENS WAS HIRED TO BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO THE CENTURIES-OLD FURRIER REVILLON, HE WOULD SLEEP ON THE FLOOR OF THE FACTORY DURING PRODUCTION SO AS TO BETTER INSPECT EVERY STITCH OF EVERY GARMENT, CONSTANTLY EDITING, REWORKING, PERFECTING EVERY PIECE AS THEY CAME TOGETHER. AND IF THAT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLY GLAMOROUS&mdash;A ROMANTIC REIMAGINING OF EVENTS TO MAKE A MORE MYTHIC LIFE STORY, THAT OF A BOHEMIAN ARTIST IN A FASHION-Y GARRET&mdash;HIS WORLD HAS ONLY BECOME MORE GLAMOROUSLY DEVOTIONAL, MORE&nbsp;LA BOH&Egrave;ME. AT 54, OWENS IS EVEN MORE OF A MONK (THOUGH WITH THE PASSIONATE FOLLOWING OF A REVIVALIST OR A CULT LEADER)&mdash;BOTH SOBER AND DECADENT, SUPPRESSING THE MORE LURID ELEMENTS OF HIS ID AND ITS APPETITES WITH A RIGOROUS REGIMEN IN THE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY. THE WAY HE HAS PRESENTLY CONSTRUCTED IT, HIS LIFE IS BASICALLY A SCAFFOLDING OF STEEL WILL UPHOLSTERED IN SABLE FUR. &nbsp; BUT WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK, BE IT PROTECTION OR A PRISON, HE SEEMS TO BE GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE, MORE PLAYFUL, ALLOWING WHIMSY AND VOLUPTUOUSNESS TO OVERWHELM THE PREVIOUS STRICTURE OF HIS FORMS. &quot;BALANCING CONTROL AND COLLAPSE IS WHAT I&#39;VE BUILT MY AESTHETIC ON,&quot; HE WROTE IN THE SHOW NOTES TO HIS FALL 2016 MENSWEAR SHOW. &quot;DISCIPLINE VERSUS INDULGENCE, IMMORTALITY VERSUS ITS DEFEAT, ARCHITECTURE VERSUS WILDERNESS ... I&#39;VE BEEN ROMANTICIZING STRAIGHT LINES FOR A WHILE, BUT HERE THEY&#39;RE FRACTURED AND INCOMPLETE, LETTING AN ORGANIC ENERGY SEEP THROUGH.&quot; IN OTHER WORDS, REST IN PEACE TO THE BRUTAL ELEGANCE OF OWENS&#39;S ART DECO PERIOD. HE&#39;S STRIKING CAMP AND HEADING OUT A LITTLE FURTHER, TOWARD SOMETHING MORE ROMANTIC. WELCOME TO HIS ART NOUVEAU PERIOD. &nbsp; IN MID-FEBRUARY, I DROPPED IN ON A CALL BETWEEN OWENS AND ONE OF HIS EARLY HEROES, A FASHION ROCK STAR OF THE &#39;80S AND &#39;90S, CLAUDE MONTANA, TO HEAR THE TWO DESIGNERS&#39; THOUGHTS ABOUT FAME AND FORTUNE, ABOUT SEX AND POWER, AND WEARING CLOTHING AS ARMOR. &mdash;CHRIS WALLACE &nbsp; &nbsp; CLAUDE MONTANA: RICK, I WENT TO YOUR STORE THIS AFTERNOON. I TRIED ON SOME MENSWEAR, WHICH LOOKED VERY NICE ACTUALLY. I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU FOR ALL OF THE BEAUTIFUL WORK THAT YOU&#39;VE DONE. &nbsp; RICK OWENS: OH, I&#39;M THRILLED.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO BE THRILLED. I&#39;M JUST TELLING THE TRUTH.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: OH, WELL, COMING FROM YOU, THAT&#39;S EXTRA-SPECIAL. I&#39;VE BEEN SUCH A FAN OF YOURS. I WAS JUST THINKING TODAY ABOUT YOUR WORK AT LANVIN. THERE AREN&#39;T ENOUGH IMAGES OF THOSE PIECES AROUND. &nbsp; MONTANA: YOU CAN&#39;T FIND THEM ON THE INTERNET?&nbsp; &nbsp; CHRIS WALLACE: THEY ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: BECAUSE DOCUMENTATION THEN WAS SO DIFFERENT. THE WAY THAT PEOPLE TOOK PICTURES AND DISTRIBUTED THEM WAS DIFFERENT. I HOPE ENOUGH OF IT IS IN MUSEUMS.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: MOST OF THOSE PIECES ARE AT THE MUSEUMS.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: YOU WERE NEVER SENTIMENTAL ABOUT KEEPING YOUR OWN ARCHIVES?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: NO.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: [LAUGHS] I LOVE THAT. I&#39;VE BEEN PRETTY BAD ABOUT IT MYSELF. I DON&#39;T SAVE VERY MUCH.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: CLAUDE, I WATCHED A VIDEO RECENTLY IN WHICH YOU WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT YOUR LOVE OF FILM. DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE? &nbsp; MONTANA: I USED TO BE VERY FOND OF AN OLD MOVIE FROM THE &#39;50S CALLED&nbsp;AUNTIE MAME&nbsp;[1958], BY MORTON DACOSTA WITH ROSALIND RUSSELL. THE CLOTHES ARE DONE BY ORRY-KELLY. THEY&#39;RE WONDERFUL.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: DID YOU EVER SEE&nbsp;TRAVELS WITH MY AUNT&nbsp;[1972], STARRING MAGGIE SMITH?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: NO.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: THAT&#39;S A PRETTY GOOD ONE. IT REMINDS ME A LOT OF&nbsp;AUNTIE MAME. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM WATCHING NOW ALMOST EVERY MORNING? I AM WATCHING&nbsp;CLEOPATRA&nbsp;[1934] WITH CLAUDETTE COLBERT. THE PRODUCTION VALUES ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. CHRIS, LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU I THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT&nbsp;CLEOPATRA, AND I AM STILL WATCHING IT. &nbsp; WALLACE: WHAT IS IT ABOUT IT THAT KEEPS YOU COMING BACK?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: THERE ARE SO MANY LAYERS&mdash;THE QUALITY, THE SUMPTUOUSNESS. ALSO I THINK IT IS THAT WHOLE ART DECO AESTHETIC, AND IT&#39;S ALL BLACK AND WHITE, SO. THERE&#39;S JUST A DEPTH OF FIELD IN THE FRAMING AND THE STAGING AND THE SCALE OF EVERYTHING. I AM STILL IMPRESSED. THERE IS ALSO A NEW VERSION OF&nbsp;METROPOLIS&nbsp;[1927] ON YOUTUBE WHERE THE DEFINITION IS SO CLEAR. DO YOU REMEMBER&nbsp;METROPOLIS, CLAUDE?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: OH, YES.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I CAN IMAGINE YOU RELATING TO THAT MOVIE VERY MUCH. YOUR CLOTHES LOOK LIKE THEY BELONG IN THOSE SETS.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: I&#39;M ALWAYS SURPRISED YOU&#39;VE NEVER TURNED YOUR HAND TO CREATING A WORLD, WHETHER IT&#39;S A MOVIE OR SOMETHING FOR THE STAGE.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: IT&#39;S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT EVER APPEALED TO ME. YOU KNOW WHY? I REALIZED BECAUSE YOU CAN&#39;T CONTROL THE PEOPLE ENOUGH. THAT&#39;S THE PROBLEM WITH OPERA. OPERA SINGERS CAN HAVE FANTASTIC VOICES, BUT YOU CAN&#39;T MANIPULATE THEM AS WELL AS YOU CAN A DRAWING OR A PAINTING. THERE&#39;S TOO MUCH LEFT TO HUMAN CHANCE. DOES THAT SOUND TOO CONTROLLING?&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: YOU DO CERTAINLY PUT ON A SHOW, THOUGH. I KNOW THAT WASN&#39;T YOUR FAVORITE THING TO DO INITIALLY, BUT YOU SEEM TO REALLY LOVE IT NOW. CLAUDE, YOU&#39;VE REALLY ENJOYED THE SORT OF THEATRICAL ELEMENT OF THE SHOWS, DID YOU NOT?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: I USED TO LIKE THAT VERY MUCH, YEAH. BUT I&#39;VE NEVER SEEN A SHOW OF RICK&#39;S. &nbsp; OWENS: YOU HAVE TO COME. I&#39;LL MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY PICKS YOU UP. I DO LOVE SHOWS NOW. I REALIZE THAT IT DOESN&#39;T EVEN HAVE TO BE ABOUT CLOTHES ANYMORE. ESPECIALLY WOMEN&#39;S RUNWAY, BECAUSE THE WAY THAT WOMEN&#39;S RUNWAY CLOTHES GET IN THE STORE ... YOU KNOW, THERE&#39;S THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THEY CALL A SHOW NOW. &nbsp; WALLACE: LIKE WHAT TOM FORD IS DOING? TIMING THE SHOW TO THE COLLECTION&#39;S RELEASE IN STORES&mdash;MAKING IT SHOPPABLE, BASICALLY? &nbsp; OWENS: RIGHT. SHOP IT OFF THE RUNWAY. I AM SURE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING LOGICAL THERE, BUT I WONDER IF THERE&#39;S AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT, BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING TOO DESPERATE TO PLEASE. I THINK THIS IS A FAST-FASHION THING THAT H&amp;M AND ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ALREADY KIND OF RULE, AND THEY DO IT SO WONDERFULLY. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF WE NEED TO COMPETE WITH THAT. MAYBE WE NEED TO BECOME EVEN SLOWER AND LESS AVAILABLE, WHICH IS KIND OF IRONIC COMING FROM ME, SELLING STUFF ALL OVER THE INTERNET. IT SOUNDS A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL COMING FROM ME, BUT I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I WANT STUFF TO BE ACCESSIBLE RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE THEN THAT MAKES IT JUST TOO DISPOSABLE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: I THINK THAT BOTH OF YOU HAVE CREATED THESE PLACES THAT, WHETHER BY LUXURY OR BY SORT OF AVANT-GARDE-NESS, EXIST OUTSIDE OF WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS DOING AND DRAW PEOPLE TO THEM. CLAUDE, DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE AVANT-GARDE? DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE IN A SPECIAL REALM? &nbsp; MONTANA: I NEVER THOUGHT THAT ABOUT MY OWN WORK, NO. BUT OTHER PEOPLE PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT ABOUT ME.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: YEAH. I AM NOT REALLY ENGAGED IN THE FASHION WORLD WHERE ADVERTISING AND A LOT OF EDITORIAL IS ESSENTIAL. I SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE ENGAGED MORE PERSONALLY, BUT I JUST NEVER DID. IT KIND OF WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST BECAUSE ANY KIND OF SUCCESS DOESN&#39;T REALLY HINGE ON ME BEING THAT VISIBLE. LIKE, I DON&#39;T HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE THERE WHEN A STORE OPENS. I DON&#39;T HAVE TO PRESENT MY COLLECTIONS TO EDITORS AND BUYERS AND EXPLAIN IT TO ANYBODY, SO THAT&#39;S KIND OF GREAT. IT EITHER ENGAGES YOU OR IT DOESN&#39;T. THERE&#39;S NOTHING I CAN ARGUE THAT IS GOING TO CONVINCE ANYBODY EVEN MORE. &nbsp; WALLACE: WELL, THAT BREEDS A VERY PASSIONATE FOLLOWING. I DON&#39;T THINK THAT PEOPLE SIP RICK OWENS&mdash;DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I THINK WHEN YOU CREATE A NICHE LIKE THAT, IT BECOMES SO SPECIFIC THAT PEOPLE IDENTIFY WITH IT. PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT, REALLY LIKE IT, AND PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T LIKE IT, REALLY HATE IT. IT&#39;S POLARIZING IN THAT WAY.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: I DON&#39;T NEED SOMEBODY TO LIKE IT. IF THEY DON&#39;T LIKE IT, THAT&#39;S ALL. &nbsp; OWENS: YEAH, AND THAT&#39;S GREAT, BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU VERY SPECIAL TO SOME PEOPLE. IT&#39;S KIND OF LIKE MAKING YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE. IF YOU REALLY FOCUS AND APPLY YOURSELF, YOU CREATE SOMETHING THAT&#39;S ... DID I JUST CALL MYSELF INDISPENSABLE? THAT&#39;S KIND OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: I THINK THAT&#39;S ALLOWED.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: YEAH, BUT PROBABLY NOT ENCOURAGED.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: [LAUGHS] BUT I THINK THAT YOU&#39;VE MADE A SAFE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES BETTER-BETTER SELF-IDENTIFY.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: THE IRONY ABOUT MAKING A SAFE SPACE FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE IS THAT IT CREATES A WALL FOR OTHER PEOPLE. NO MATTER HOW INCLUSIVE YOU WANT TO BE, THE MORE INCLUSIVE YOU ARE, YOU KIND OF CREATE SOMETHING EXCLUSIVE. IT&#39;S KIND OF FUNNY HOW THAT TURNED OUT. I DON&#39;T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH, THOUGH, BECAUSE IT&#39;S A NATURAL EVOLUTION, AND IT WILL ALL EVEN OUT. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT THE FURTHER IT GOES, THE PEOPLE WHO FELT INCLUDED ARE GOING TO FEEL LIKE IT&#39;S TOO GENERAL AND WILL REJECT IT AT SOME POINT, AND SO YOU KIND OF RUN THE RISK OF, LIKE, A LOVE AFFAIR THAT PETERS OUT. I KIND OF ASSUME THAT THAT IS INEVITABLE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: DO YOU REALLY?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I AM PRETTY SKEPTICAL. &nbsp; WALLACE: I TEASED YOU RECENTLY THAT YOU&#39;RE SOFTENING FROM YOUR SIGNATURE SORT OF BRUTALISM TOWARD SOMETHING MORE ART NOUVEAU. IS THIS A KIND OF BLOSSOMING? ARE YOU LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE THAT. ALL EVIDENCE POINTS THAT WAY. ALTHOUGH, THIS WEEK WE WERE DOING SOME JACKETS, THESE DRAPED JACKETS, AND, FOR SOME REASON, WE WEREN&#39;T GETTING THESE DRAPES JUST RIGHT. FOR TWO DAYS WE WERE WORKING ON THESE JACKETS, AND I WAS QUESTIONING EVERYTHING, QUESTIONING MY VERY EXISTENCE: &quot;I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING.&quot; LIKE, &quot;WHY CAN&#39;T I CONTROL THIS?&quot; I WAS GETTING VERY, VERY UPTIGHT, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE SERENITY THAT I AM TRYING TO GET TO, THE OPPOSITE OF THE SERENITY THAT I AM TRYING TO EXPRESS. I WAS GETTING SNIPPY WITH EVERYONE. I WAS GETTING SHARP AND IRRITATED AND IMPATIENT AND HURT. I WAS KIND OF HORRIFIED. I THOUGHT I HAD GROWN BEYOND THIS AND REACHED A LEVEL OF IMPERTURBABILITY WHERE I COULD JUST SORT OF SMILE THROUGH SOME SMALL INCONVENIENCE LIKE THIS. I WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED OF MYSELF. I WAS JUST IN A REALLY BAD MOOD ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THESE THINGS DONE. I WAS THINKING I HAVE A PROBLEM COMMUNICATING AND GETTING MY POINT ACROSS. I CAN&#39;T ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE. I CAN&#39;T MOTIVATE PEOPLE. I CAN&#39;T MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD IN A POSITIVE, LOVING WAY. WHY AM I GETTING ANGRY WITH PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO HELP? IT WILL ONLY MAKE THIS WORSE. WHAT IS SO THREATENING TO ME THAT IT MAKES ME NEGATIVE? I KNOW THERE IS THIS PETTY SIDE THAT EVERYBODY HAS, AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE IT, AND I HATE IT, BUT I SPEND A LOT OF TIME FORGIVING MYSELF FOR IT TOO. SO WHAT? EVERYONE HAS THEIR MOMENTS. BUT IT THREW ME HOW NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO MY TEAM AND NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MYSELF MADE ME QUESTION HOW I OPERATE IN THE WORLD AND HOW I COMMUNICATE IN THE WORLD. IT WAS HUMBLING.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THAT COMES FROM? THE RIGOR, THE PERFECTIONISM ...&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: THE IMPATIENCE COMES FROM INSECURITY, RIGHT? THAT&#39;S WHAT IT WOULD BE. BECAUSE A PERFECTLY SERENE PERSON DOES NOT GET FLUSTERED. I WAS FLUSTERED. AND THAT FLUSTERED ME&mdash;THE FACT THAT I GOT FLUSTERED. IT IRRITATED ME. AND I WAS ALREADY IRRITATED. IT WAS A WEIRD-ASS WEEK. I WAS A TOTAL CUNT.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: CLAUDE, ARE YOU A PERFECTIONIST?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: I USED TO BE. WHEN YOU&#39;RE IN FRONT OF A PIECE OF CLOTHING, IF YOU DO NOT EXACTLY DO WHAT YOU WISH YOU COULD, YOU WON&#39;T ACCEPT IT. IT&#39;S MAKING SOMETHING THAT JUST CORRESPONDS TO YOUR OWN PERSONALITY, TO WHAT YOU REALLY WISH.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SEPARATE THINGS, THOUGH, ABOUT EXPRESSING MY PERSONAL IDEA OF BEAUTY, AND ALSO WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED BEAUTIFUL. I LIKE THE IDEA OF PROMOTING ALTERNATIVE IDEAS OF BEAUTY. THE FASHION WORLD CAN BE VERY STRICT ON THE STANDARDS OF BEAUTY, AND I LIKE PUSHING IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT. I LIKE TEASING THOSE IDEAS A LITTLE BIT, BY PROMOTING QUIETER KINDS OF BEAUTY. BUT ALSO I AM THINKING ABOUT BEAUTIFUL ASPIRATIONS AND BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR, AND I HAVE FOUND THAT NOW, WITH THE FASHION SHOWS, I AM ABLE TO EXPRESS THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN I USED TO. SO NOW I CAN INTRODUCE IDEAS OF, LIKE, &quot;WHAT IF WE LIVED IN A WORLD WITHOUT SHAME?&quot;&mdash;WHEN I HAVE GUYS WITH THEIR D CKS OUT. OR, WITH WOMEN CARRYING EACH OTHER, IT&#39;S TAKING A MINUTE TO APPRECIATE THOSE MOMENTS WHEN SOMEONE IS SUPPORTING SOMEBODY IN NEED. THAT&#39;S A VERY STIRRING MOMENT THAT WE CAN ALL APPRECIATE AS A BEAUTIFUL THING. THAT&#39;S BEEN EXCITING TO ME, THAT I&#39;VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING, PROMOTE THOSE IDEAS.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: I THINK IT MATTERS, BECAUSE, IN 10 OR 20 YEARS OR SO, PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF STANDARDS, BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE EXPANDED THEIR LANGUAGE, THEIR REFERENCE POINTS, THEIR EMPATHY. BUT THOSE THINGS ARE ELASTIC. THEY DO COME BACK IN ERAS WHEN THINGS ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: IT DOES COME BACK. &nbsp; OWENS: WHEN I LOOK AT THE RUNWAY NOW, THEY&#39;RE VERY REFERENTIAL TO&nbsp;MARY TYLER MOORE&nbsp;OR TO A KIND OF A &#39;70S THING. WHICH SHOCKS ME, BECAUSE CLAUDE&#39;S CLOTHES WERE NOT REFERENCING ANYTHING BEFORE. THEY WERE MODERN AND ARCHITECTURAL, AND THEY SEEMED RIGHT FOR THE TIME. AND CLOTHES NOW, THEY&#39;RE ALL KIND OF NOSTALGIC. I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THAT&#39;S ABOUT. I DON&#39;T GET IT. OH GOD, I AM SOUNDING REALLY CRITICAL AREN&#39;T I?&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: CLAUDE, DO YOU NOTICE REFERENCES TO YOUR WORK IN CLOTHES THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING TODAY?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME SO, BUT I DON&#39;T GET THAT.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE DESIGNERS COLLABORATING WITH H&amp;M? WOULD YOU HAVE EVER DONE THAT?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: YES, OF COURSE. WHY NOT? THAT WOULD BE A GREAT EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY. WHY NOT BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL KINDS OF WOMEN? IT&#39;S A GREAT IDEA. NOBODY EVER CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME TO WORK FOR A COMPANY LIKE THAT. BUT, AS YOU SAY, RICK, IF YOU MAKE YOURSELF TOO AVAILABLE ... &nbsp; OWENS: IT DILUTES IT.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: BUT, CLAUDE, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU DIDN&#39;T EVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH EXPOSURE, PERSONALLY OR PROFESSIONALLY? DID YOU MIND BEING FAMOUS?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: WELL, ACTUALLY, I GUESS I DID MIND BEING FAMOUS. BUT THEN, IN ANOTHER WAY, BEING ANONYMOUS ISN&#39;T REALLY GREAT.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: RICK, DO YOU STRUGGLE AT ALL WITH THAT?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: WELL, I NEVER REALLY HAD THE FAME THAT CLAUDE DID. I LIVE SO QUIETLY; THERE IS NO FAME HERE. BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY, THOUGH, THAT IT&#39;S LOVELY TO WALK OUT THE DOOR, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, SOMEBODY COMES UP AND SAYS SOMETHING NICE TO YOU. I HAVE ENOUGH FAME FOR PEOPLE TO BE FRIENDLY ON THE STREET. IT&#39;S LOVELY TO FEEL CONNECTED IN THE WORLD. I FEEL LIKE I KIND OF ENGAGED WITH THE WORLD, AND THEY&#39;RE KIND OF FEELING THE SAME THING.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: IT DOESN&#39;T SEEM LIKE THAT&#39;S THE MAIN POINT, THOUGH; IT FEELS LIKE A BY-PRODUCT. WOULD YOU BE MAKING CLOTHES IN A GARAGE EVEN IF NOBODY KNEW ABOUT IT?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: YEAH, I REALLY WOULD. THAT WAS MY BUSINESS PLAN IN THE BEGINNING. THAT&#39;S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO. I WAS GOING TO MAKE CLOTHES AND BE POOR AND JUST DO WHAT I WANTED. I MEAN, I AM SURE I WOULD HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT THE PLAN WAS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED AND NOT TO HAVE TO COMPROMISE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: WAS THERE A SORT OF IMAGE IN YOUR HEAD? HAD SOMEBODY DONE THAT ALREADY?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: OH, YEAH. THERE WAS CHARLES JAMES. THEN THERE WAS IGGY POP AND PATTI SMITH&mdash;PEOPLE WHO JUST DID IT THEIR OWN WAY. &nbsp; MONTANA: I WAS VERY FASCINATED BY THE DESIGNERS WHO MADE CLOTHES FOR THE MOVIES, LIKE ADRIAN&mdash;HE DID FABULOUS THINGS&mdash;AND TRAVIS BANTON.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: DID YOU EVER SPEND TIME IN LOS ANGELES?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: YES, I WENT TO L.A. I MET WITH EDITH HEAD. IT WAS QUITE A WHILE AGO. SHE WAS VERY FUNNY. AND YOU KNOW SHE HAD, LIKE, SEVEN OR EIGHT OSCARS. AND SHE USED TO PUT THE OSCARS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR, SO WHEN THE PEOPLE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM, THEY WOULD SEE SEVEN BUT THEN MULTIPLIED BY THE MIRROR TO, LIKE, 50. [LAUGHS] &nbsp; WALLACE: CLAUDE, YOU WERE ONCE CALLED THE MARILYN MONROE OF THE GAY WORLD. &nbsp; MONTANA: [LAUGHS] THAT&#39;S FUNNY TO ME. I DON&#39;T KNOW. IF YOU SAY SO.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: YOU WERE A SEX SYMBOL.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: NO! MAYBE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: WAS SEX APPEAL OR SEXUALITY IMPORTANT TO YOU IN YOUR WORK?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: WELL, IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT AT SOME POINT IN MY LIFE, BUT NOT ANYMORE. NOT TODAY. IT&#39;S NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: IT WAS NEVER OVERT SEXUALITY, THOUGH. IT WAS NEVER CORNY SEXUALITY. THERE WASN&#39;T A LOT OF BOOBS; IT WAS VERY COVERED UP. I REMEMBER YOUR CLOTHES BEING SEVERE AND COVERED UP. IT&#39;S MORE ABOUT POWER.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: THAT&#39;S FOR SURE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: IF CLAUDE IS MARILYN MONROE, RICK, WOULD YOU BE GARBO?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I WANT TO BE CHER.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: I WOULD RATHER BE GARBO THAN MARILYN ACTUALLY.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I REMEMBER CHER WENT WITH YOU TO THE FRENCH FASHION AWARDS. SHE LOOKED INCREDIBLE.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: SHE CAME FROM LOS ANGELES TO BE WITH ME AT THE AWARDS.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: WAS CHER SOMETHING OF A MUSE FOR YOU?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: SHE WAS ... SOMETHING. I THINK MUSES ARE IMPORTANT. YOU&#39;VE GOT TO HAVE MUSES. MAYBE A FEW OF THEM.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL TEAM WHO ARE VERY INFLUENTIAL IN WHAT I DO. IT&#39;S KIND OF FUNNY HOW EVERYBODY&#39;S ENERGY COMBINED CREATES SOMETHING BEYOND WHAT THERE WOULD BE WITH JUST ME. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY. THERE IS KIND OF A GREAT FAMILY BALANCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT GROUP OF PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT I THINK IS VERY POWERFUL. THAT&#39;S AN AMAZING THING, TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS THE POWER OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE. I MEAN, YOU&#39;RE LIVING WITH THESE PEOPLE IN A SUBMARINE, IN A FASHION SUBMARINE, SO MANY HOURS A DAY, SWEATING TOWARDS THE SAME THING. THERE&#39;S GOT TO BE SOME AMAZING ALCHEMY THERE THAT, IF THE COMBINATION WERE DIFFERENT, WOULDN&#39;T QUITE BE THE SAME.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: SO WHAT IS YOUR HIRING PROCESS LIKE, BECAUSE YOU&#39;RE INVITING SOMEBODY INTO THAT? YOU MUST HAVE RIGOROUS BACKGROUND CHECKS.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: [LAUGHS] YOU WOULD THINK SO. BUT I AM INCREDIBLY SLOPPY ABOUT IT. I WOULD JUST SAY NO TO EVERYBODY. SO IT&#39;S MICH&Egrave;LE AND MY CEO, ELSA, WHO ARE KIND OF THE GATEKEEPERS. IT DOESN&#39;T ALWAYS WORK OUT. SOMETIMES I REALLY CAN&#39;T MAKE IT WORK&ndash;THERE&#39;S NEVER ANYTHING REALLY FORCEFUL, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T WORK JUST KIND OF FALL AWAY GENTLY.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: BOTH OF YOU HAVE THESE SORT OF TRIBES. BUT, RICK, WHO IS IN YOUR COMMUNITY? WHO ARE YOUR CLOSE FRIENDS?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: IT&#39;S PROBABLY MY FAMILY, THE FAMILY THAT I&#39;VE CREATED HERE. I AM WITH THEM EVERY DAY. IT&#39;S JUST HOW IT BECOMES. BUT I WAS JUST THINKING, I DON&#39;T KNOW DESIGNERS THAT REALLY HANG OUT TOGETHER. I REALLY CARE FOR RAF A LOT. AND I JUST MET PHOEBE PHILO, WHO IS JUST ADORABLE. ALBER IS JUST LOVABLE. THERE IS A GREAT GROUP TO KNOW. IT&#39;S A LOVELY PERIOD, A NICE GENERATION OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING STUFF.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: ARE YOU LOOKING AT SHOWS ONLINE? &nbsp; OWENS: OH YEAH. I LOOK AT EVERYBODY&#39;S SHOWS BECAUSE I AM A FASHION FAN. I MEAN, I LIKE FASHION. AND I LIKE TO SEE WHAT EVERYBODY IS DOING, AND IT&#39;S FUN. SURE! I LOOK AT EVERYBODY AND OBSERVE EVERYTHING.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: DON&#39;T YOU ALSO GO DEEP ON TUMBLR?&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: OH YEAH, I DO. TOTALLY. FOR A WHILE THERE, THERE WERE SOME SUPER-DISTURBING ONES. VERY, VERY DARK AND VERY SICK, AND I WAS ENJOYING THOSE FOR A LONG TIME, BUT THEN I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I JUST WANDERED AWAY FROM THAT OR IF IT JUST KIND OF WENT AWAY, AS IF THE NOVELTY RAN OUT. THEY&#39;RE NOT AS CREEPY AS THEY USED TO BE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: CREEPY HOW? LIKE, SNUFF? &nbsp; OWENS: WELL, KIND OF GOING THERE. NOTHING ILLEGAL, BUT JUST KIND OF SINISTER, CREEPY STUFF. IT WAS FUN BECAUSE IT WAS LURID. THERE IS A BIG LURID SIDE TO ME. TO ALL OF US. I MEAN, NOBODY CAN DENY THAT THAT&#39;S A LITTLE BIT TITILLATING AND EXCITING. IT&#39;S ONLY HUMAN.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: I&#39;VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THAT SORT OF&nbsp;WALKING ON THE WILD SIDEPART OF YOUR LIFE, MAYBE BECAUSE I AM SO SQUARE. DID YOU WALK ON THE WILD SIDE, CLAUDE?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: I USED TO, TAKING DRUGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. IT DOESN&#39;T INTEREST ME ANYMORE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: DID I READ THAT YOU USED TO LIKE SEX CLUBS?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: OH NO, NO, NO.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: CHRIS, THERE ARE NO SEX CLUBS IN PARIS.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: RUIN MY FANTASIES, WHY DON&#39;T YOU.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: [LAUGHS] THERE ARE NONE!&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: ON TOP OF THAT, IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS WITH THE DISEASE GOING AROUND.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: RIGHT. SEX WAS VERY SCARY.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I AM THINKING THAT THE CLOTHES THAT YOU WERE MAKING DURING THAT THREATENING SEXUAL PERIOD WERE VERY MUCH ABOUT BEING POWERFUL AND BEING PROTECTED.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: LIKE ARMOR.&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: PROBABLY. THEY WERE LIKE PROTECTION, MAYBE.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: RICK, DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR CLOTHES ARE ARMOR AT ALL? I FEEL LIKE YOUR CLOTHES ARE VERY OPEN AND EMBRACING OF LATE.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: THEY HAVE BEEN ARMOR FOR SURE. BUT ARMOR IS JUST A GOOD-LOOKING THING. THERE&#39;S ALSO MY THEORY ABOUT MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORMS: MILITARY UNIFORMS HAVE JUST BEEN PERFECTED OVER CENTURIES TO MAKE A MAN LOOK DIGNIFIED AND HEROIC. AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUALITIES TO EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO PROJECT A SENSE OF STRENGTH AND HONOR, SO CLOTHES AS ARMOR DON&#39;T NECESSARILY JUST HAVE TO MEAN DEFENSE; THEY CAN ALSO MEAN SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE ELEGANT. BUT IT&#39;S TRUE, MY CLOTHES HAVE BECOME VERY SENSUAL OF LATE, AND I DON&#39;T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF, 10 YEARS FROM NOW, I&#39;LL BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE MOTIVATION WAS. MAYBE IT&#39;S ME JUST SOFTENING WITH AGE. BUT AS WITH THE DRAPED JACKETS, I THOUGHT I WAS SOFTENING, AND THEN I WASN&#39;T. I WAS JUST STILL UPTIGHT. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR LEARNING. I WAS SURPRISED BY HOW FAR AWAY I WAS FROM THAT LEVEL OF SERENITY THAT I AM KIND OF HOPING FOR AT SOME POINT.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: BUT YOU&#39;RE SO SELF-REFLECTIVE. AND I DON&#39;T MEAN NEUROTIC OR ANYTHING, BUT I DON&#39;T THINK YOU&#39;LL EVER TOTALLY LET YOURSELF OFF THE HOOK.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: YOU&#39;RE RIGHT. I&#39;LL NEVER LET MYSELF OFF THE HOOK BECAUSE I AM ALSO INCREDIBLY CRITICAL ABOUT EVERYTHING. I AM ALWAYS GOING TO BE BEATING MYSELF UP AND THEN FORGIVING MYSELF AFTERWARDS FOR BEATING MYSELF UP, AND THEN GETTING ON MYSELF FOR LETTING MYSELF BEAT MYSELF UP ... I&#39;M VERY BUSY. VERY, VERY BUSY.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: BUT THE CRITICAL-NESS. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU&#39;RE RIGHT?&nbsp; &nbsp; MONTANA: YOU NEVER KNOW. &nbsp; OWENS: I DON&#39;T ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT&#39;S RIGHT, BUT I KNOW WHAT&#39;S WRONG A LOT. I CAN USUALLY DEFINE THAT. I COLLECT ENOUGH STUFF ALL DAY LONG SO THAT I FEEL LIKE I KIND OF HAVE A LIBRARY OF IDEAS THAT I CAN EDIT, AND I CAN CREATE NEW COMPOSITIONS. THE PART WHERE I AM SUPERCRITICAL IS MY BEHAVIOR, HOW I CAN PUT THE RIGHT KIND OF ENERGY OUT AND HOW I CAN LEAVE A TRAIL OF LOVE BEHIND ME INSTEAD OF MAKING SOMEBODY FEEL LIKE S IT BECAUSE THEY COULDN&#39;T GET SOMETHING DONE THAT I WANTED. I HATE THAT. I KNOW WHEN SOMETHING IS WRONG IF IT DIDN&#39;T COME OUT IN A POSITIVE WAY. I AM NOT AS CRITICAL ABOUT THE STUFF THAT I MAKE AS YOU WOULD THINK. I HAVE LEARNED AT THIS POINT HOW TO GET IT TO WHERE I WANT TO BE PRETTY MUCH. THAT&#39;S WHY, WITH THESE JACKETS, WHERE I WASN&#39;T GETTING IT, IT WAS FREAKING ME OUT ... OH, BY THE WAY, EVERYTHING WORKED OUT TODAY, AND I LOVE EVERYTHING, SO THE MOOD IS OVER.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: [LAUGHS] OH GOOD. WELL, THAT&#39;S ALL IT TAKES.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: YEAH, REALLY. I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT PART.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: I WONDER IF YOUR SORT OF REGIME IS A PROTECTION FROM BEHAVIOR THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO MORE SELF-CRITICISM.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: OH DEFINITELY. IT&#39;S JUST ABOUT BEHAVIOR. YEAH, REGIME ... I NEVER WORK OUT ENOUGH, ETCETERA. SO IT&#39;S DEFINITELY A BARRIER FROM LETTING MY HEAD GET CARRIED AWAY WITH ME.&nbsp; &nbsp; WALLACE: DON&#39;T THINK I DON&#39;T NOTICE THAT YOU DIDN&#39;T ANSWER THAT QUESTION ABOUT LURID, WILD SIDE...&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: I&#39;M SAVING THAT FOR THE BOOK. &nbsp; WALLACE: I REALLY WANT YOU TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.&nbsp; &nbsp; OWENS: WELL, YOU WRITE IT. BUT I&#39;M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION UNTIL LATER. &nbsp; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

THE CONSTRUCTION WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.” FLASH-FORWARD TO TODAY, AND RICK OWENS SNEAKERS APPEAR ON A DIVERSE RANGE OF BRAND DEVOTEES WHO WORSHIP HIS CLOTHES LIKE A RELIGION. THEY’RE A HARD-TO-MISS CLAN THAT’S EQUAL PARTS GLAM AND GOTH, TYPICALLY DRESSED IN ALL BLACK AND WEARING ONE OF HIS SIGNATURE LEATHER JACKETS. “RICK OWENS HAS CULTIVATED A PASSIONATE AND LOYAL FOLLOWING WHO WEAR THE COLLECTION LIKE A UNIFORM,” SAID FEDERICO BARASSI, MENSWEAR BUYING MANAGER FOR SSENSE, AN E-TAILER THAT FOCUSES ON LUXURY AND INDEPENDENT DESIGNERS. YET IN THE BEGINNING, OWENS WAS SIMPLY A DESIGNER MAKING CLOTHES OUT OF OLD T-SHIRTS, OPERATING FROM A GRUNGY STOREFRONT OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN LOS ANGELES. “IT WAS VERY MUCH A SCOTCH-TAPED APPROACH,” OWENS SAID. HE ORIGINALLY LAUNCHED HIS LABEL AS A WOMEN’S COLLECTION IN 1994, ADDING MENSWEAR IN 2002. NOW, HIS PRIVATE PARIS-BASED COMPANY, OWENSCORP, IS A $120 MILLION BUSINESS — ONE THE DESIGNER STILL OWNS WITHOUT OUTSIDE INVESTORS AND RUNS WITH THE HELP OF HIS ENIGMATIC WIFE AND PARTNER OF 25 YEARS, MICHÈLE LAMY — OR AS OWENS CALLS HER, “A NO-BULLSHIT MAGIC WITCH.” TOGETHER, OWENS AND LAMY HAVE EXTENDED THE BRAND BEYOND READY-TO-WEAR CLOTHING, ALSO DABBLING IN FURNITURE AND INTERIOR DESIGN. OWENS HAS ALSO TACKLED SPORTSWEAR, FOSTERING A PARTNERSHIP WITH ADIDAS THAT HAS SPURRED ONGOING FOOTWEAR COLLABORATIONS. NO MATTER WHETHER HE’S DESIGNING ADIDAS SPORTS SHOES OR LACE-UP COMBAT BOOTS AND ARCHITECTURAL SNEAKERS (WHICH HE PRODUCES IN ITALY), OWENS SAID HE CRAFTS HIS PIECES WITH A CERTAIN SENSE OF PRACTICALITY IN MIND. “I LIKE THINGS THAT FUNCTION AND THAT ARE LOGICAL,” HE SAID. “THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS. I MEAN, NO ONE WOULD EVER ASSUME THAT.” OWENS’ DISTINCTIVE FOOTWEAR STYLES HAVE IGNITED A HEALTHY CONSUMER APPETITE FOR HIS BRAND, ONE THAT LUXURY RETAILERS CAN’T DENY. “HIS RANGE IS VAST, PRODUCING EVERYTHING FROM TRAINERS THAT WORK FOR EVERYDAY [WEAR] TO STATEMENT PIECES LIKE THIGH-HIGH BOOTS,” SAID TOM KALENDERIAN, EVP AND GMM OF MEN’S AND CHELSEA PASSAGE DEPARTMENTS FOR BARNEYS NEW YORK. “REGARDLESS, THE AFICIONADOS WHO BUY THE MOST EXTREME FOOTWEAR LIKELY WEAR IT EVERY DAY CONFIDENTLY, AS THOUGH THEY WERE A BASIC.” ROMA COHEN, CO-OWNER OF THE ALCHEMIST, SAID OWENS’ SNEAKERS HAVE SERVED AS A DRIVING FORCE IN LAUNCHING A NOW-BURGEONING SCENE. “HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO DESIGN A LEATHER SNEAKER IN THE $1,300 PRICE RANGE MANY YEARS AGO, WHICH PAVED THE WAY FOR MILLENNIAL CLIENTS MOVING TOWARD THE DESIGNER-SNEAKER WORLD,” HE SAID. ONE OF HIS GREATEST SNEAKER HITS INCLUDES HIS SIGNATURE GEOBASKET STYLE, A BULKY SNEAKER THAT AIMED TO EXAGGERATE — AND SOMEWHAT PARODY — ICONIC NIKE, ADIDAS AND PUMA MOTIFS. “SPORTS SHOES WERE NEVER MY THING,” SAID OWENS. “THE ONLY REASON I STARTED MAKING THEM WAS BECAUSE THEY FRUSTRATED ME. THEY WERE A LITTLE TOO PROSAIC. I WANTED TO EXOTICIZE THEM.” WHEN THE DESIGNER LAUNCHED THE GEOBASKET IN 2008, HE PROMPTLY RECEIVED A CEASE-AND-DESIST LETTER FROM NIKE, CLAIMING THE STYLE’S SIDE SWOOSH DESIGN WAS TOO SIMILAR. “I WAS JUST FLATTERED TO DEATH,” SAID OWENS. “I SWOONED.” AS A RESULT, THE STYLE HAS BEEN REDESIGNED AND CONTINUES TO BE ITS BEST-SELLING SHOE. (THE ORIGINAL DESIGN STILL POPS UP ON EBAY FOR MORE THAN $2,000 A PAIR.) NO STRANGER TO CONTROVERSY INSIDERS CAN’T THINK OF THE DESIGNER WITHOUT CONJURING UP IMAGES OF HIS MANY BUZZY — NOT TO MENTION DIVISIVE — RUNWAY SHOWS. WHERE SEVERAL FASHION HOUSES ARE COMPETING FOR THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT VENUES TO HOST THEIR PRESENTATIONS — THINK CHANEL’S CRUISE ’17 SHOW IN HAVANA OR CHRISTIAN DIOR’S CRUISE ’17 SHOW AT PIERRE CARDIN’S PALAIS BULLES — OWENS AIMS TO DISRUPT RATHER THAN PLAY INTO THE INDUSTRY’S INDULGENT NATURE. THERE WAS THE SPRING ’16 WOMEN’S SHOW, WHERE MODELS CARRIED OTHER MODELS AS ACCESSORIES. BEFORE THAT, THE FALL ’15 MEN’S SHOW, WHERE MODELS BRAVED FULL-FRONTAL CUTOUTS. AND WHO COULD FORGET THE SPRING ’14 WOMEN’S SHOW, WHERE OWENS FORWENT MODELS AND ENLISTED AFRICAN-AMERICAN STEP DANCERS FROM VARIOUS AMERICAN SORORITIES. FOR OWENS, WHO SHOWED HIS SPRING ’17 MEN’S SHOW, WALRUS, IN PARIS LAST WEEK, RUNWAY THEATRICS CONVEY A PERSONAL FEELING AND STATEMENT FOR THE SEASON. “I DON’T THINK IT’S POSSIBLE TO REALLY SHOCK ANYBODY ANYMORE, ALTHOUGH I’M SURPRISED SOMETIMES,” SAID OWENS. “I DON’T WANT TO WASTE PEOPLE’S TIME. IT’S A BUSY CALENDAR, SO IF YOU’RE GOING TO DO A SHOW, DO A SHOW.” THE SHOWS OFTEN SPUR MUCH CONVERSATION, AND THEIR FRONT-ROW CROWDS CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHT OWENS’ WIDE-RANGING CLIENTELE. HIS FANS INCLUDE ICONS SUCH AS IRIS APFEL AS WELL AS RAPPERS A$AP ROCKY AND KANYE WEST. OWENS’ FALL ’16 MEN’S AND WOMEN’S SHOWS, TITLED MASTODON, FEATURED AN ECOLOGICAL FOCUS. THE COLLECTION AIMED TO TACKLE AN ANXIETY HE WAS FEELING AT THE TIME — AN ANXIETY ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD, ABOUT FASHION’S TENDENCY TO DRIVE OVERCONSUMPTION. DETAILS INCLUDED EERIE TOUCHES SUCH AS BULBOUS MASSES OF MOHAIR AND BLEACH STAINS DRIPPING LIKE MAGMA. “THE WHOLE IDEA OF ECOLOGY WASN’T AS A SERMON. IT WAS MORE A CURIOSITY,” SAID OWENS. “I WANTED THINGS TO LOOK LIKE THEY WERE DEGENERATING AND EVAPORATING ON THE RUNWAY. I WAS ALSO THINKING OF DINOSAURS, AND IT MADE ME THINK OF EXAGGERATED, WEIRD SHAPES.” TO ACCOMPANY HIS FALL RUNWAY LOOKS, OWENS COLLABORATED WITH ADIDAS ON THE SHOES. FOR MEN’S, HE REWORKED THE ADIDAS PRO MODEL STYLE, AN ARCHIVAL BASKETBALL SHOE FROM 1969. “I WANTED THEM TO BE PUMPED UP AND LOW-TECH,” HE SAID. FOR THE WOMEN’S OFFERING, OWENS CREATED LEATHER THIGH-HIGH SNEAKER LEGGINGS WITH THICK RUBBER SOLES, A SIGNATURE OF HIS. LAWRENCE MIDWOOD, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF DESIGN FOR ADIDAS Y-3 AND STYLE COLLABORATIONS, WAS DRAWN TO OWENS’ UNCOMPROMISING VISION FOR THE SHOES THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS. “RICK IS INHERENTLY OBSESSED WITH NOT DOING WHAT EVERYONE ELSE WOULD OR COULD DO,” MIDWOOD SAID. “HE’S ALSO A SPORTS NUT, SO HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO INSPIRE HIM PERSONALLY. IT WAS CLEAR HE DIDN’T JUST WANT TO CHANGE THE MATERIALS AND PUT HIS LOGO ON IT. HE STARTED TO CHALLENGE EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY IN A REALLY GREAT WAY.” CHALLENGING IS WHAT OWENS DOES BEST, AFTER ALL. IT’S A MANDATE HE FOLLOWS IN ALL ASPECTS OF HIS BUSINESS. CONSIDERING MAJOR CONGLOMERATES SUCH AS LVMH MOËT HENNESY LOUIS VUITTON AND KERING DOMINATE TODAY’S LUXURY REALM, IT’S FITTING, THEN, THAT THE DESIGNER HAS MAINTAINED HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE AND UNPREDICTABILITY. “IT’S KIND OF A MIRACLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE,” OWENS SAID. ALTHOUGH HIS COMPANY’S COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR, LUCA RUGGERI, AND ITS CEO, ELSA LANZO, ARE SHAREHOLDERS IN THE COMPANY, OWENS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY — AND THE TALL TASK — OF BEING BOTH THE MAIN BUSINESSMAN AND DESIGNER. HE HAS THE ABILITY TO CALL THE SHOTS IN AN INDUSTRY THAT SOMETIMES TREATS DESIGNERS MORE LIKE PUPPETS. BUT IN THE EARLY YEARS, HE DID CONSIDER CASHING IN. “THERE WAS A MINUTE WHERE I CONSIDERED SELLING OUT, BECAUSE I WAS OFFERED A LOT OF MONEY THAT I WASN’T SURE I WOULD EVER BE OFFERED AGAIN,” SAID OWENS. “BUT LOOKING BACK, IT WOULD HAVE KILLED ME. I CAN’T REALLY WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE. I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO ANYBODY. I DON’T HAVE A DESIGN TEAM BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT I GET TO DO — THAT’S MY FUN.” WHEN HE ISN’T DESIGNING HIS COLLECTIONS, OWENS IS BUSY FINDING THE BALANCE BETWEEN BOTH WORKING AND LIVING WITH LAMY. WITH HER GOLD TEETH AND TATTOOED HANDS AND HIS LONG, FLOWING BLACK HAIR, THEY MAKE A STRIKING PAIRING — BUT AT WORK, HE PREFERS TO KEEP THEIR ROLES MORE SEPARATE. HE CAN BE FOUND TOYING AWAY AT THE READY-TO-WEAR COLLECTIONS WHILE LAMY HANDLES THE BULK OF THEIR FURNITURE VENTURE, LAUNCHED IN 2007, AND SOURCING EXOTIC MATERIALS — A DOMAIN HE CALLS “LAMY-LAND.” “WE’RE OPPOSITES,” OWENS SAID. “MICHÈLE IS VERY SPONTANEOUS, AND HER EMOTIONS ARE A LOT MORE ON THE SURFACE. WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER, IT’S IMPOSSIBLE. SHE HAS SUCH A FREESTYLE WAY OF GETTING THINGS DONE THAT IT MAKES ME CRAZY. SHE RESPECTS ME FOR SOME KIND OF STABILITY, BUT ALSO REACTS AGAINST MY STRAIGHTNESS.” RETAIL IS ONE AREA OF THE BUSINESS WHERE THE DUO’S DIFFERENT TALENTS ARE ON FULL DISPLAY. WITH MORE IMPORTANCE BEING PLACED ON PHYSICAL RETAIL EXPERIENCE THAN EVER BEFORE — CUSTOMERS NEED A REASON TO SHOP IN PERSON NOW, ESPECIALLY WITH THE POPULARITY OF LUXURY E-TAILERS — OWENS AND LAMY FOCUS ON OFFERING SHOPPERS UNIQUE DESTINATIONS THAT COMBINE THEIR TWISTED SENSE OF HUMOR. FOR STARTERS, A CONSUMER DOES NOT SIMPLY SHOP IN A RICK OWENS STORE. ONE NAVIGATES ITS STARK, CONCRETE SPACE INSTEAD, USUALLY FILLED WITH THE BRAND’S OWN ECCENTRIC FURNITURE AND DÉCOR. (BE CAREFUL: WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BENCH COULD VERY WELL BE AN ART PIECE.) THE DESIGNER’S LOS ANGELES STORE FEATURES A FOG WALL AND MASSIVE WATER TANK FILLED WITH GOO. IN HONG KONG, THE CENTERPIECE IS A GLASS-TOP TABLE SUPPORTED BY A LIFE-SIZE MANNEQUIN OF OWENS ON ALL FOURS. CHRIS BENFIELD, AN ARCHITECT AT BENFIELD PARTNERS WHO WORKS WITH OWENS ON HIS NORTH AMERICAN FLAGSHIPS, SAID THE DESIGNER’S APPROACH TO RETAIL MIMICS THE THOUGHTFUL EXPERIENCES FOUND IN HIS RUNWAY SHOWS. “HE USES [HIS STORES] TO EXTEND LARGER CONCEPTUAL IDEAS,” BENFIELD SAID. “IT’S LIKE HIS OWN GALLERY. AND HIS SPACES COINCIDE WITH EACH SEASON HE’S SHOWING, WHICH HELPS THE MERCHANDISE SPEAK.” IN THE COMING WEEKS, OWENS WILL REOPEN HIS NEW YORK STORE WITH A NEW ADDRESS AT HOWARD AND CROSBY STREETS. THE STORE WILL BE DOUBLE THE SIZE — 6,000 SQUARE FEET — AND SPAN TWO LEVELS. IT WILL SELL ITS FULL MEN’S AND WOMEN’S COLLECTIONS, AS WELL AS ITS FURNITURE ASSORTMENT. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO MARK THE FIRST TIME THAT OWENS WILL HAND OVER COMPLETE CREATIVE REINS TO LAMY FOR THE INTERIOR DESIGN. “I’M EXPERIMENTING WITH LETTING GO FOR A MINUTE. IT’S KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP EXPERIMENT, TOO,” SAID OWENS. “THERE’S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE IDEA OF [MICHÈLE] GOING INTO THE SPACE WITH THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. SHE PHYSICALLY GETS IN THERE WITH A STEPHEN JONES HAT ON, AND ALL OF HER JEWELRY AND HER HEELS.” THE OWENS-LAMY FURNITURE PIECES, WHICH ARE SOLD THROUGH NEW YORK ART GALLERY SALON 94, DRAW A CLEAR TIE-IN TO HIS SHARP, MINIMALIST FASHION DESIGNS, WITH ITEMS SUCH AS BEHEMOTH PLYWOOD TABLES AND MARBLE BENCHES WITH MOOSE ANTLER BACKINGS. AS THE DESIGNER PREPS FOR HIS SPRING ’17 WOMEN’S SHOW IN THE FALL, ONE CAN EXPECT HIS EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO CONTINUE. OWENS HINTED THE COLLECTION WILL FEATURE A MORE RESTRAINED VERSION OF HIS GEOBASKET SNEAKER. “IT’S A SLEEKER, LIGHTER, LOWER SKATER SHOE I CALL THE GEOTHRASHER,” OWENS SAID. THE COLLECTION WILL ALSO BE TITLED WALRUS. THIS SORT OF ABSTRACT INSPIRATION IS AN ENTICING PART ABOUT OWENS, POSITIONING HIM SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HIGHLY SKILLED CRAFTSMAN AND A COMPLETE MADMAN. REGARDLESS, THE DESIGNER IS CONTENT TO CONTINUE SHAKING UP THE INDUSTRY IN FASHION, FURNITURE AND SPORTS — ALL WITH A DOSE OF HEALTHY SELF-AWARENESS ALONG THE WAY. “I’M JUST HAPPY STAYING IN MY CORNER AND DOING WHAT I DO,” SAID OWENS. “AND BELIEVE ME, I’M AS SURPRISED AS EVERYBODY THAT I GOT THIS FAR.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

HIS FERTILE IMAGINATION PLACES HIM – ALWAYS – AHEAD OF HIS TIME, RESHAPING CONTEMPORARY CREATION WITH GEOMETRICAL AND POWERFUL SILHOUETTES, AND HIS ARTISTIC INTENTIONS ARE AT THE CORE OF AN IMMEDIATE AND ANTICONFORMIST REALITY, MIXING HIS INSTINCT, HIS INTIMATE PROCESS AND A REFLECTIVE QUEST. WITH A SOLID HISTORY OF LECLAIREUR STANDING BY THE DESIGNER SINCE THE VERY EARLY DAYS, FOUNDER ARMAND HADIDA AND RICK OWENS TOOK TIME TO EXCHANGE THEIR THOUGHTS ON ART, AND THE ARTS… ARMAND HADIDA: PARIS LOVES YOU. WE’RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO TRAVEL ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND IT’S BEEN A PRIVILEGE TO WITNESS YOUR INCREASING PRESENCE IN ALL THE CAPITALS AROUND THE WORLD. WE’RE PROUD TO HAVE BEEN WITH YOU IN THE EARLY BEGINNING OF THE STORY. RICK OWENS: YOU DEFINITELY HELPED TO DEVELOP THAT STORY. I LOVE HOW YOU INTRODUCED THE FIRST CHAPTER OF YOUR STORY TO THE FASHION WORLD, AND HOW YOU’RE ABLE TO MIX, TODAY, FASHION, DESIGN AND ART. I USE THE WORD ART BECAUSE FASHION, TO ME, AND DESIGN, ARE ART. I’M SURE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS WOULD BE INTERESTING. WHEN WE INTRODUCED OURSELVES, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS DOING, IN A WAY, SO I DIDN’T KNOW HOW WE WERE DIFFERENT. I HAD NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO, BECAUSE I’D NEVER BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY. WE JUST DID IT THE WAY IT MADE SENSE FOR US, IN OUR OWN WAY, TO ME, TO MY PARTNERS, MICHÈLE, ELSA AND LUCA. THEIR CREATIVITY MATCHED MINE, IN THIS ADVENTURE, AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TALENT TO DO WHAT THEY WERE DOING. THEY WERE PRETTY SMART ABOUT IT. WE’VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 14 YEARS NOW, THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN, DOES IT, IN THE FASHION WORLD? THAT KIND OF LONGEVITY IS VERY SPECIAL TO US… THE WAY YOU CHOOSE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF IS VERY DIFFERENT, ANYTHING BUT CLASSICAL OR CONVENTIONAL. TAKE YOUR SHOWS, FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OURSELVES. I DON’T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPRESS MYSELF IN THE ART WORLD, EVEN THOUGH I WENT TO ART SCHOOL. AT THE TIME, I DIDN’T REALLY THINK I HAD ENOUGH TO GIVE TO THE ART WORLD, I WAS MORE INTIMIDATED BY IT, IMPRESSED BY THE RULES I THOUGHT WERE THERE, THE THEORY AND ANALYSIS… IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME, AND I DIDN’T REALIZE THERE WERE OTHER WAYS TO CREATE ART, NOT JUST THE CERTAIN FORMULAR WAY OF MAKING ART. NOW I THINK I MIGHT HAVE MISCALCULATED THINGS, BUT THAT’S REALLY THE REASON I WENT TO FASHION. IT WAS ANOTHER FORM OF CREATIVITY, AND IT WAS EASIER. NOW, IT’S HARD TO TALK ABOUT THE ART WORLD WITHOUT SOUNDING CRITICAL OR SUPERIOR, AND I DON’T WANT TO DO EITHER, BUT I THINK THE FASHION WORLD HAS HAD TO BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED BECAUSE IT’S MORE COMPETITIVE. CLOTHES ARE NOT ENOUGH ANYMORE, YOU NEED SOMETHING MORE PERSONAL AND INTENSE THAN JUST GOOD CLOTHES. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD CLOTHES OUT THERE. WHEN I GO TO A DEPARTMENT STORE, I KIND OF FREAK OUT SOMETIMES: SO MUCH STUFF TO BUY! HOW ON EARTH ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BUY OUR STUFF COMPARED TO ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF? IT’S STILL A MYSTERY. I THINK WHAT MAKES SOMEBODY STAND OUT IS IF THEY PUT MORE INTO IT THAN JUST CLOTHES. THE FUNNY THING, WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT, IS THAT I ALWAYS SOUND LIKE I KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS. I DON’T, AND I HATE SOUNDING LIKE I MIGHT, LIKE A KNOW IT ALL, BUT I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS SO MUCH MORE THAN CLOTHES, SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE FASHION SHOWS, SO MUCH MORE THAN THE LIFESTYLE. WHAT I’VE DONE, WHAT I’VE MADE A POINT OF DOING IS SO MUCH ABOUT MY LIFE. SOMETIMES I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF VANITY INVOLVED, WHICH DISTURBS ME, BUT THEN I KIND OF FORGIVE MYSELF BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE AN ELEMENT OF VANITY. IT’S OK. I CREATE A WORLD THAT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO MAKE AND DEFINE IN A SPECIFIC AND PRECISE WAY. YES, I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF EGO INTO THAT AND, WELL, THAT’S FINE. YOU CAME TO FASHION AFTER LEARNING ITS TECHNICAL ASPECTS, AS A PATTERN MAKER, AND YOU COMBINED THAT WITH YOUR ART SCHOOL EDUCATION. TOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE EVOLUTION OF EXPRESSION, THEY’RE A FORM OF EDUCATION IN THEMSELVES, AREN’T THEY? TAKE YOUNG DESIGNERS, FOR EXAMPLE; THE MORE TOOLS YOU GIVE THEM, THE BETTER CHANCE THEY HAVE AT OPENING DOORS AND EXPRESSING THEMSELVES BEYOND THE WORK. IF YOU’RE SMART, IF YOU’RE A TALENTED PERSON, YOU’RE HUNGRY FOR INFORMATION AND VORACIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR IT. THE THING I HAD, THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE, IS TECHNICAL SKILLS. THAT’S WHY I OFTEN URGE YOUNG PEOPLE, ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE CREATIVE, AND KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY, TO PACK IT UP TECHNICALLY. EVERYBODY HAS SOME KIND OF CREATIVE TASTE. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH GOOD TASTE. INSPIRATION. EVERYBODY HAS INSPIRATION, BUT EXECUTION IS EVERYTHING. CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PLANS FOR THE NEXT SHOWS? I’M THINKING OF DEVELOPING SOMETHING ELSE. THAT’S WHY I WAS GETTING INTO GESTURE AND PHYSICAL MOVEMENT ON THE RUNWAY: IT’S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT CLOTHES ANYMORE. I DON’T LIKE TO USE THE WORD « PERFORMANCES » WHEN REFERRING TO THE SHOWS, BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY A CEREMONY. I THINK THEY ARE A CEREMONY ON BEAUTY. PEOPLE GATHER TOGETHER TO EXPERIENCE, THEY EXPERIENCE YOUR PERSONAL COMBINATION OF BEAUTY, OF WHAT I CONSIDER BEAUTIFUL AND WHEN THEY GO TO THE STORES TO BUY CLOTHES, THEY COME BEARING THE CEREMONY THEY WERE INVOLVED IN. THAT’S HOW I SEE FASHION SHOWS NOW. THE CLOTHES ARE ONLY ONE ELEMENT AMONGST MANY. THE SCALE THAT WE’VE GOTTEN TO IS BIGGER THAN WHAT I COULD HAVE IMAGINED BUT EVEN IF WE WERE REDUCED, I FEEL I WOULD STILL BE SATISFIED BECAUSE ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE THERE. FAMILY, CREATIVITY, HEALTH… WE’VE BEEN DOING IT IN A WAY THAT I AM HAPPY WITH, AND WHEN I LOOK BACK, I FEEL PROUD. DO YOU HAVE ANY FAVORITE PLACES IN PARIS, PLACES YOU GO TO FOR INSPIRATION? A SPECIAL MUSEUM OR GALLERY? I ALWAYS LIKE GOING TO PANTIN. I’M NOT REALLY GOOD AT SPOTTING NEW CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS. MICHÈLE LOVES THAT. ME, I LIKE OLD ART, OLD STUFF. I GO TO FAIRS SOMETIMES. I GO BECAUSE IT’S… A PARTY. SOMETIMES I’LL SEE THINGS THAT I LIKE, BUT I CAN’T REALLY COMPLETELY ENGAGE WITH A NEWCOMER BECAUSE I NEED TO SEE THE WHOLE STORY. I NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT FROM BEGINNING TO END. I NEED TO HAVE THE GRAVITY OF SEEING THE FULL CIRCLE, SOMEONE MAINTAINING THEIR VISION REGULARLY UNTIL THEY DIE. I KIND OF NEED THAT, AND THERE’S ALSO A SORT OF… MELANCHOLY. IT’S OVER, AND THAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL, BECAUSE IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE THAT SAME EXPERIENCE, OR THAT EXPRESSION. THAT SAID, I ALSO LOVE GOING TO SEE NEW ART BECAUSE I LOVE FEELING WHAT A CREATIVE COMMUNITY, A CULTURAL COMMUNITY IS DOING. IT’S ENERGIZING.

PLENTY OF PEOPLE DON’T REALIZE THAT RICK OWENS CREATES FURNITURE, AS WELL AS FASHION, AND THAT HE’S DONE SO SINCE 2007. THAT’S PARTLY BECAUSE OWENS CONSCIOUSLY KEEPS THE PIECES OUT OF MOST OF HIS STORES; AND PARTLY BECAUSE, EVEN IN SITU, IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE FURNITURE. INSTEAD, THEY RESEMBLE ANGULAR, FACETED ROCKS MADE OF MATERIALS AS DIVERSE AS CARRARA MARBLE OR PLYWOOD, MAYBE EMBEDDED WITH A MOOSE ANTLER. OWENS’S OWN BED — ONE OF AN EDITION OF THREE — IS A MONUMENTAL TOMBLIKE STRUCTURE OF ALABASTER SLABS WHICH, WHEN COMBINED WITH ITS MATCHING DAYBED, WEIGHS TWO TONS. “THE FURNITURE — BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER A NECESSITY FOR US — WAS SOMETHING THAT WE JUST DID FOR OURSELVES TO INDULGE OUR OWN AESTHETIC APPETITES AND OUR PERSONAL NEEDS,” OWENS SAYS IN HIS SIGNATURE CALIFORNIA DRAWL, ON THE PHONE FROM HIS STUDIO IN PARIS. “WHEN I WAS FIRST STARTING THE FURNITURE, I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY MESSAGE OF INTENT: IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE, ‘A FUR ON A ROCK, NEXT TO A FIRE, IN A CAVE.’ AND I LITERALLY CREATED A ROCK, THE ROCK THAT I WANTED…” HE LAUGHS. OWENS SOMETIMES ATTEMPTS TO DUMB DOWN HIS OWN COMPLICATED IDEAS, BUT LATER, HE REELS OFF HIS AESTHETIC INFLUENCES. “THERE WAS ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS, THERE WAS BRUTALISM, THERE WAS MARCEL BREUER ARCHITECTURE AND THERE WERE GERMAN BUNKERS.” THOSE ANTECEDENTS ARE ALL THERE, REWORKED INTO THE AESTHETICS OF THE CHUNKY, SLICED-UP BOULDERS HE CALLS CHAIRS AND TABLES, WHICH CHALLENGE THE IDEA OF A DESIGNER’S INTERIORS LINE AS RUN-OF-THE-MILL SOFT FURNITURE. (THERE ARE PILLOWS, OWENS EMPHASIZES, THAT MAKES ALL THAT ROCK CRYSTAL AND PETRIFIED WOOD SOMEWHAT MORE COMFORTABLE.) NEXT MONTH, OWENS’S DESIGNS WILL GET THEIR DUE AT THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART, LOS ANGELES, WITH A SWEEPING SHOW THAT DISPLAYS BOTH PRE-EXISTING FURNITURE AS WELL AS NEWLY PRODUCED PIECES. THERE’S NO FASHION INCLUDED, BARRING A VIDEO OF OWENS DRAPING A LOOK FROM HIS SPRING/SUMMER 2016 MEN’S WEAR SHOW “CYCLOPS.” THERE ARE ALSO A SERIES OF CANVASES BY THE LATE AMERICAN CONTEMPORARY ARTIST STEVEN PARRINO, WHOSE PUNK-TINGED WORK — SLASHED, TWISTED, TORN, GENERALLY MISTREATED AND MOSTLY MONOCHROME — HAS A DIRECT AESTHETIC LINK TO OWENS’ AVANT-GARDE FASHION AND FURNITURE. “THE PIECES AT MOCA HAVE BECOME MORE SCULPTURAL AND LESS DEFINABLY FURNITURE THAN BEFORE,” OWENS SAYS. “FOR A MUSEUM SHOW, IT’S KIND OF LIKE A RUNWAY SHOW. DO WE REALLY NEED TO SEE THE FUNCTIONAL STUFF ON A RUNWAY SHOW, OR DO WE NEED TO SEE THE STORY? DO WE NEED TO SEE DEDICATION AND EVOLUTION, AND ASPIRATION?” IN AN ACCOMPANYING BOOK, WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI IN FEBRUARY, OWENS EMPHASIZES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MICHÈLE LAMY — HIS WIFE AND CREATIVE PARTNER, WHOM HE AFFECTIONATELY CALLS “HUN” — IN BOTH THE CONCEPTION AND CREATION OF THE FURNITURE. “MICHÈLE HAS ALWAYS SAID IN INTERVIEWS THAT WE DIDN’T GET TOGETHER TO HAVE BABIES, AND THAT’S TRUE,” OWENS ALLOWS (WHEN THEY MARRIED IN 2006, HE WAS 45 AND LAMY WAS 62). “BUT THIS IS KIND OF OUR BABY, BECAUSE THIS IS VERY MUCH A STORY OF A RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS MY AESTHETIC AND I PASS THE BALL TO HER, AND THEN SHE RESPONDS AND PASSES THE BALL BACK TO ME. THAT’S WHAT THE FURNITURE HAS BECOME.” LAMY WAS ABSENT FROM THE OWENS STUDIO WHEN WE SPOKE, HAVING TRAVELED TO NEW YORK FOR THE OPENING OF THE LABEL’S NINTH STAND-ALONE STORE AND THEN TO CALIFORNIA TO INSTALL THE MOCA SHOW. BUT HERS IS THE HAND THAT BRINGS THE FURNITURE TOGETHER, WORKING IN PARIS WITH ÉBÉNISTES, OR CRAFTSMEN, AND WITH OTHER SPECIALISTS FOR SPECIFIC MATERIALS. (THE ROCK CRYSTAL ELEMENTS, FOR INSTANCE, WERE CREATED IN PAKISTAN.) IT’S NOT THAT COZY,” DEADPANS OWENS, AS ONLY A MAN WHO CREATED A TWO-TON BEDROOM SET CAN DO. “IT’S SOLID AND IT’S GOING TO LAST FOREVER. I WANT IT TO LAST FOREVER. I WANT IT TO OUTLIVE US ALL. I WANT IT TO BE MONUMENTAL. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH COZINESS IN OUR LIVES. ISN’T IT NICE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCIPLINE AND TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU SIT UP KIND OF STRAIGHT?” HE LEAVES THAT QUESTION HANGING. “COMFORT ISN’T EVERYTHING.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

SUCH LYRICAL DICHOTOMY IS PERHAPS WHAT BEST DEFINES THE WORLD THAT OWENS REFLECTS THROUGH HIS COLLECTIONS, WHOSE ELEMENTAL RHYTHM AND DISQUIETING HARMONY OFTEN FEEL ANALOGOUS TO A PERFECTLY CRAFTED MELODY. THUS, IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE DESIGNER OFTEN CREATES THESE COLLECTIONS TO PERFECTLY ALIGN WITH THE MUSIC THAT ACCOMPANIES THEM ON THE RUNWAY, AND THAT THE PRECISION HE IS RENOWNED FOR MANIFESTS IN MORE THAN JUST THE CLOTHING HE DESIGNS BUT EQUALLY IN THE UNIVERSE IT IS FIRST PRESENTED WITHIN. HERE, OWENS PRESENTS A CELEBRATION OF THE MUSIC AND THE EXPERIENCE OF STAGING A FASHION SHOW, ALONGSIDE HIS OWN REFLECTIONS ON THE SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN MUSIC AND FASHION. ON COMPOSING HIS SHOW MUSIC... &quot;I STARTED DOING THE MUSIC WITH A FRIEND FROM L.A. AFTER I MOVED TO EUROPE, BECAUSE IF I DIDN&#39;T FIND SOMETHING FOR US TO DO TOGETHER WE WOULD LOSE TOUCH. WE HAVE MIXED EVERY SHOW TOGETHER; EVEN WHEN I COMMISSION A MUSICIAN TO COMPOSE SOMETHING I HAVE PRETTY SPECIFIC PREFERENCES FOR PACING AND CAN&#39;T RESIST FINE TUNING THE SEQUENCE. WE GO THROUGH EVERY SECOND AND FILTER AND TWEAK UNTIL I GET WHAT I WANT.&quot; ON HIS INSATIABLE APPETITE... &quot;I&#39;M ALWAYS, ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW MUSIC. NOT FOR SHOWS, BUT FOR MY PERSONAL APPETITE – THE SHOW MUSIC IS JUST INCIDENTAL. THAT BEING SAID, I DECIDE ON THE SHOW MUSIC PRETTY EARLY ON IN THE DESIGN PROCESS, AND I&#39;M USUALLY EDITING THE MUSIC AND THE COLLECTION AT THE SAME TIME. THE COLLECTION IS DEFINITELY FED BY THE MUSIC.&quot; ON BEING A GENRE SLUT... &quot;I&#39;M A TOTAL SLUT WHEN IT COMES TO GENRES – I&#39;M JUST AS CRAZY ABOUT SHOW TUNES AND OPERA AS I AM ABOUT TECHNO. ONE OF MY PERSONAL CAREER HIGHS WAS USING ALICE COOPER FOR BOTH MY FIRST NEW YORK SHOW (SICK THINGS) AND FIRST PARIS SHOW (DEVIL&#39;S FOOD).

BUT HE HAS ANOTHER PASSION, TOO: FURNITURE, WHICH HE DESIGNS AND PRODUCES IN COLLABORATION WITH HIS FRENCH WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY. “IT STARTED OUT AS A PRIVATE THING—SOMETHING WE WERE DOING FOR OURSELVES,” OWENS SAYS, SITTING IN HIS PARIS STUDIO EARLIER THIS FALL. “WE NEEDED A NEW BED. THEN WE THOUGHT, A COUCH WOULD BE NICE.” NOW HIS BRAND’S NEW MANHATTAN STORE IS FILLED WITH SITE-SPECIFIC PIECES, A FORTHCOMING BOOK ON THE COUPLE’S INTERIORS IS BEING PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI, AND AN EXHIBITION OF THEIR NEO-PALEOLITHIC FURNITURE (A SHOW OWENS CALLS “A LOVE LETTER TO MICHÈLE”) WILL OPEN DECEMBER 17 AT THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART, LOS ANGELES (MOCA). “THE RICK OWENS WORLD IS VERY CLOSED. I WORK IN AN ISOLATED WAY,” HE EXPLAINS. “MICHÈLE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW, AND THE FURNITURE BECAME HER BABY.” THE WAY THEY WORK TOGETHER IS STRAIGHTFORWARD: OWENS SKETCHES PIECES AND SHOWS THEM TO LAMY. “SHE EITHER FROWNS OR GETS INTO IT,” HE SAYS WITH A LAUGH. IF SHE EMBRACES A DESIGN, SHE USES WHAT OWENS CALLS HER “CHAOS MAGIC” TO EXECUTE IT WITH TEAMS OF ARTISANS. “THAT’S THE PART SHE LOVES—ORCHESTRATING,” HE SAYS. “SHE’S LIKE AN OLD-FASHIONED SALONISTE.” STOOLS AND BENCHES COMBINE STARK GEOMETRIC FORMS WITH SCULPTURAL ANTLERS, SLEIGHLIKE RECAMIERS MIX HUMBLE PLYWOOD AND LUXE LEATHER, AND MONOLITHIC BEDS ARE CRAFTED OUT OF ALABASTER BLOCKS. WHEN OWENS CONCEIVED THE NEW YORK STORE—AN 8,000-SQUARE-FOOT SPACE ON THE CORNER OF HOWARD AND CROSBY STREETS—HE HAD A PRECISE IDEA. “I WANTED TO MAKE IT AS REDUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE—FUR AND ROCK NEXT TO A FIRE IN A CAVE.” HE CAME UP WITH BENCHES AND DISPLAY TABLES HE NOW DESCRIBES AS “BOULDERS” THAT HAVE “FACETS DERIVED FROM WORLD WAR II GERMAN BUNKERS, EILEEN GRAY LINES, JEAN-MICHEL FRANK RESTRAINT, ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS GEOMETRY, AND CLAUDE PARENT’S FASCINATION WITH THE OBLIQUE.” LAMY HAD VERSIONS MADE IN STYROFOAM, ROCK CRYSTAL, AND CONCRETE AND COVERED SOME WITH CAMEL FUR—A MATERIAL SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH WHILE TRAVELING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. OWENS PLACED THE PIECES THROUGHOUT THE STORE, SOMETIMES STACKING THEM LIKE TOWERS, AN EXERCISE HE LIKENS TO “KIDS PLAYING WITH ROCKS AND MAKING A FANTASY WORLD.” THE BOUTIQUE’S FURNITURE IS NOT FOR SALE (“THE STORES SELL CLOTHES,” OWENS EXPLAINS), BUT OTHER WORKS ARE SHOWN AT FAIRS BY SALON 94, AMONG HIS OTHER GALLERIES. WHEN THE MOCA TEAM APPROACHED OWENS ABOUT AN EXHIBITION, HE WAS INITIALLY RETICENT—HE WASN’T CONVINCED IT MADE SENSE IN THE MUSEUM’S PACIFIC DESIGN CENTER OUTPOST—BUT, “UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I THOUGHT, THIS LOOKS PRETTY COOL.” SOME OF THE TWO DOZEN PIECES ON DISPLAY WILL BE FROM HIS PERSONAL COLLECTION, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE MADE FOR THE SHOW. “PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY, ‘YOUR FURNITURE IS NOT VERY COZY,’” HE ADMITS. “BUT I LIKE THINGS THAT ARE DISCIPLINED, THAT MAKE YOU SIT STRAIGHTER, WHERE THERE IS MORE RIGOR AND MORE FORMALITY. I THINK THERE IS A PLACE FOR THAT. THE WORLD IS ALREADY FULL OF COZINESS.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

STRAPS HERE BECOME LOVING RIBBONS,&rdquo; EXPLAINS&nbsp;RICK OWENS&nbsp;IN THE SELF-PENNED SHOW NOTES FOR HIS SPRING/SUMMER 2016 WOMEN&rsquo;S COLLECTION, TITLED CYCLOPS. &nbsp; USUALLY, IF ANYTHING IS STRAPPED TO A MODEL ON THE CATWALK, IT&rsquo;S AN EXPENSIVE HANDBAG, THE BAGUETTE-AND-BEURRE OF FASHION HOUSES. A HANDBAG IS MORE READY TO WEAR THAN READY-TO-WEAR ITSELF, BECAUSE ANYONE CAN WALK INTO A SHOP, SLAP DOWN A CREDIT CARD AND LIVE THE DREAM THROUGH IT. THERE IS NO STRESS ABOUT SIZING OR WHETHER IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOUR PARTICULAR BODY. A PRETTY BAG WILL ALWAYS BE PRETTY, THEREFORE YOU CAN SMILE AND SWING IT AS HARD AND PROUD AS YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET. &nbsp; BUT, IN CASE YOU HADN&rsquo;T NOTICED, RICK OWENS IS NOT YOUR REGULAR DOILIES-AND-SALMON-SANDWICHES, FLORALS-FOR-SPRING TYPE FASHION HOUSE. THE DESIGNER IS ONE OF THE FEW WHO DOESN&rsquo;T PARADE LEATHER GOODS IN SHOWS &ndash; THOUGH HE DOES MAKE THEM, FROM CREATURES SUCH AS FROGS, HORSES, AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS THAT&rsquo;D MAKE CHER FROM&nbsp;CLUELESS, OR ANY SMALL CHILD, SCREAM. INSTEAD, WHAT RICK OWENS STRAPPED TO HIS MODELS WERE OTHER WOMEN. IN DOING SO, HE MADE A STATEMENT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN BLINGING MINAUDI&Egrave;RE COULD ACHIEVE. THEY REALLY WERE &lsquo;LOVING RIBBONS&rsquo;, FEMINISM RECLAIMED FROM THE JAWS OF 2016 CLICKBAIT. &nbsp; &ldquo;I JUST THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE PHYSICAL MESSAGES WE COULD EXPLORE OTHER THAN PUTTING WOMEN IN REALLY HIGH SHOES,&rdquo; SAYS OWENS FROM HIS LEFT BANK BATCAVE, THE PARIS FORTRESS IN WHICH HE LIVES, WORKS AND CREATES HIS VERY PARTICULAR KIND OF FRENCH FANCY (WITH AN AMERICAN ACCENT). &ldquo;I LIKE THE IDEA OF PRESENTING DIFFERENT IDEAS OF BEAUTY, NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY BUT MORALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.&rdquo; &nbsp; FOR A WHILE, OWENS HAS BEEN DOING SHOWS THAT EXPLORE THE ELEMENTS &ndash; WIND, FIRE, WATER &ndash; AND SUGGEST OUR PLACE WITHIN A LARGER CONTEXT THAN JUST THE HERE AND NOW. &ldquo;IT WAS ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ETERNITY,&rdquo; HE SAYS. &ldquo;GETTING MORE INTROSPECTIVE WAS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP &ndash; MAKING IT MORE ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH OURSELVES. REDUCING THE THEATRICALITY DOWN TO THE PHYSICAL GESTURE JUST SEEMS STRONGER.&rdquo; &nbsp; THE SS16 SHOW WAS ABOUT &ldquo;NOURISHMENT, SISTERHOOD, MOTHERHOOD AND REGENERATION&rdquo;, ADDS OWENS. &ldquo;WOMEN RAISING WOMEN, WOMEN BECOMING WOMEN, AND WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN.&rdquo; HIS MODELS WERE NOT CAST, AS CONVENTION DICTATES, FROM AGENCIES, BUT FROM DIFFERENT PARIS GYMNASTIC GROUPS. &ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T LIKE TO SHOW WOMEN UNDER STRAIN ON THE RUNWAY, BUT THESE WERE ATHLETES USED TO WORKING WITH THEIR BODIES, AND I LIKED THE IDEA OF SHOWING THAT POWER.&rdquo; &nbsp; THE CLOTHES FOR THE COLLECTION WERE CREATED IN TANDEM WITH THE CHOREOGRAPHY, SO THE RESULTS WERE A WORK OF TOTAL INTEGRITY. SHOULDERS WERE SHARPLY DEFINED; SLEEVES ON COATS COULD BE REMOVED TO DRIFT BEHIND THE BARE ARM LIKE A CAPE. HARNESSES WERE INTEGRATED INTO JACKETS &ndash; AND THEY WERE SOLD THAT WAY IN THE SHOWROOM. &ldquo;THE JACKETS WITH HARNESS BUCKLES WILL BE RELICS OF THE EXPERIENCE,&rdquo; NOTES OWENS. &ldquo;AND, FOR THE RECORD, I THINK THAT WAITING THREE MONTHS (TO BUY) THOSE RELICS MIGHT BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE TO THE FAST FASHION MOOD THAT WE SEEM TO BE ENTERING. I THINK THERE&rsquo;S ROOM FOR BOTH SPEEDS.&rdquo; &nbsp; SOCIAL MEDIA ORGASMED OVER THE SHEER VISUAL POETRY OF THE SHOW. AS ONE WOMAN WAS IN CONTROL, PHYSICALLY PROPELLING HERSELF FORWARD ON FOOT, THE OTHER WAS SUSPENDED, ALONG FOR THE RIDE. IT FELT VERY HUMAN, FASHION WITH THE CAGE DOOR LEFT OPEN. A SYMPHONY OF COMPASSION. THE MUSIC WAS UNKLE&rsquo;S ARRANGEMENT OF &ldquo;THIS LAND&rdquo;, THE THEME FROM THE 1960 FILM&nbsp;EXODUS&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;USED AS A REFLECTION ON THE TIMELESSLY FEMALE WAY OF PROTECTING AND NURTURING A TRIBE, SUNG LIVE BY VOCAL POWERHOUSE ESKA&rdquo;. &nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;M NOT TRYING TO SUGGEST I HAVE ANY BIG MESSAGE,&rdquo; SAYS OWENS. &ldquo;I JUST LIKE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT ANGLES OF HUMANITY AND PICKING OUT MOMENTS OF BEAUTY THAT MIGHT BE OVERLOOKED. I FEEL LIKE I&rsquo;M FULFILLING A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY BY PUTTING GOOD ENERGY OUT THERE. DO I SOUND LIKE AN EARNEST, NEW-AGE HIPPY? I&rsquo;M TOTALLY A SELFISH CUNT, BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF TRYING TO BE BETTER AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF THAT TRANSCENDENT LEVEL BEING ALWAYS OUT OF GRASP, BUT WE TRY ANYWAY BECAUSE THE EFFORT IS REWARD ENOUGH.&rdquo; &nbsp; WE ARE SPEAKING ON THE LAST DAY OF THE AUTUMN/WINTER 2016&nbsp;MENSWEAR&nbsp;SHOWS. OWENS HIMSELF PRESENTED&nbsp;MASTODON, ARGUABLY HIS GREATEST MENSWEAR LINE-UP YET, THREE DAYS AGO. EVERYTHING ON THAT CATWALK WAS A &lsquo;PIECE&rsquo;, ESPECIALLY THE ULTIMATE DUSTY MOHAIR PARKAS AND THE TYPE OF HIGH AND TIGHT LEATHER JACKETS LOU REED USED TO WEAR SO WELL. THE SOUNDTRACK WAS DAT OVEN&rsquo;S PUMMELLING VOGUING ANTHEM &ldquo;ICY LAKE&rdquo;, WHOSE ANSWERPHONE REFRAIN &ldquo;I JUST THOUGHT I&rsquo;D CALL BEFORE I THROW MYSELF INTO THE ICY LAKE&rdquo; IS REPEATED TO THE POINT WHERE YOU REALISE IT&rsquo;S PURE EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL. NATURALLY, THE TRACK WAS PLAYED REALLY. F CKING. LOUD. &nbsp; &ldquo;IT HELPS ME TAKE THINGS LESS SERIOUSLY IF I CONSIDER MY POSITION AND STATUS IN THE CONTEXT OF 400,000 YEARS,&rdquo; SAYS OWENS OF THE SHOW, WHICH ENTERTAINED THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMANITY GOING THE WAY OF THE DINOSAURS. &ldquo;AND IT HELPS ME THINK OF WHAT I WOULD LIKE CLOTHES TO LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW.&rdquo; &nbsp; IN HIS STUDIO, THERE&rsquo;S NO BUSTLING, NO SHUFFLING, NO SENSE OF IT STILL BEING FASHION WEEK, ALBEIT THE TAIL-END. HE&rsquo;S STRAIGHT INTO FINISHING OFF ANOTHER COLLECTION, TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW RELENTLESSLY DESIGNERS WORK. YET THIS SUNDAY EVENING MOOD IS AS PLEASANT AS WAITING FOR THEANTIQUES ROADSHOW&nbsp;TO START (DO THEY HAVE THAT IN FRANCE? IT WOULD BE FULL OF SUBLIME GEAR &ndash; THE COUNTRY SPAWNED ART DECO, AFTER ALL). &nbsp; CONSIDERING THE SIGNATURE FLOURISH THAT APPLIES TO EVERYTHING HE DOES, OWENS OFFERS, PULLQUOTE READY: &ldquo;I&rsquo;M A CONCRETE CUPCAKE TOPPED WITH MERINGUE.&rdquo; WELL, QUITE. IF YOU&rsquo;RE WONDERING WHAT THE GREAT ONE DRINKS, OTHER THAN THE URANIUM-STRENGTH ESPRESSO WE&rsquo;VE JUST SHOT, IT&rsquo;S THE BRILLIANTLY SUNSHINEY ORANGINA &ndash; HE&nbsp;IS&nbsp;FROM CALIFORNIA &ndash; OFF A SILVER TRAY. ONLY FINE PEOPLE QUAFF THAT. IT&rsquo;S A FACT. &nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;VE ALWAYS PROFESSED COMPLETE INNOCENCE REGARDING THE &lsquo;CULT&rsquo; THING,&rdquo; HE SAYS OF THE WORD OFTEN USED TO DESCRIBE THE OBSESSIVE FANDOM HE INSPIRES. &ldquo;BUT, ON FURTHER REFLECTION, I GUESS THAT&rsquo;S WHAT I&rsquo;VE BEEN PUTTING OUT THERE: INCLUSIVITY, THE COMMITMENT TO AN AESTHETIC IDEAL AND STICKING TO IT. TRYING TO FULFILL YOUR MORAL AND COMPASSIONATE POTENTIAL, RESTRAINT AND MODESTY &ndash; WHICH I VIOLATE REPEATEDLY &ndash; AND AN APPRECIATION OF COMMUNITY. THAT&rsquo;S WHAT I&rsquo;VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT INTO MY SHOWS: (IT&rsquo;S ABOUT) HOW PEOPLE TREAT EACH OTHER AND FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO CONNECT AFTER THE INITIAL SIGNALS THAT THEIR CLOTHES PROJECT ARE REGISTERED.&rdquo; &nbsp; WHILE OWENS IS NOT CONCERNED WITH ROLLING OUT NEW LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES TO STICK HIS NAME ON AND FACILITATE BUYING A HAMPTONS HOME DROWNING IN STRIPED CUSHIONS, HE DOES POSSESS AN UNFAILING DESIRE TO CREATE HIS OWN HARMONIOUS UNIVERSE BEYOND GETTING DRESSED. NATURALLY, ANYONE WITH SUCH A STRONG FASHION AESTHETIC &ndash; AND HIS HAS BEEN TRACED OVER BY SOME OTHER BRANDS, BOLD AS BRASS &ndash; WOULD HAVE A VISION FOR OTHER STUFF, BE IT BRONZE URNS OR BONE-HANDLED PRONGS TO PUSH FOOD AROUND A PLATE WITH. OWENS CREATES PRODUCTS TO ENRICH OUR EXPERIENCES, BECAUSE LIFE IS IN THE DETAILS. REALISING THAT SMARTPHONES AREN&rsquo;T SO SMART WHEN IT COMES TO BATTERY LIFE, HIS LATEST BEYOND-CLOTHES OFFERING IS A POCKET PHONE CHARGER, AS SEXY AND EXOTIC-LOOKING AS SOMETHING INDIANA JONES MIGHT HAVE FOUND. &nbsp; THE WORD IN THE DICTIONARY TO DESCRIBE WHAT RICK OWENS DOES IS NOT &lsquo;LIFESTYLE&rsquo;, BUT &lsquo;GESAMTKUNSTWERK&rsquo; &ndash; A SYNTHESIS OF MANY DIFFERENT FORMS TO CREATE A DEFINITIVE STATEMENT. (OK, IT&rsquo;S A GERMAN DICTIONARY.) &ldquo;DO YOU THINK I&rsquo;M EVER GONNA GET ANYONE TO SAY &lsquo;GESAMTKUNSTWERK&rsquo; INSTEAD OF LIFESTYLE?&rdquo; HE JABS. &ldquo;I&rsquo;M NOT SURE THAT THE STUFF I MAKE IS GENUINELY ANYONE&rsquo;S LIFESTYLE BUT MY OWN. I&rsquo;M JUST CUSTOMISING STUFF I WANT AND SELLING SOME OF IT TO FUND MY BEING ABLE TO CUSTOMISE MORE STUFF.&rdquo; &nbsp; STILL, WE SEE IT AND WE WANT IT, AND THAT IS HOW EMPIRES ARE BUILT. HIS BUSINESS IS HUGE FOR SOMEONE WITH SUCH A DELICIOUSLY ALTERNATIVE SPIRIT AND A PREDILECTION FOR LIFE&rsquo;S OUTSIDERS. THE RICK OWENS GRIFFE IS THE ULTIMATE REVENGE OF THE FREAKS, WHO LOOK SO FABULOUS IN HIS ASYMMETRIC DRAPING THAT THE NORMS WANT IN ON THE ACTION. HOW EXCELLENT IS THAT? IT MIGHT SOUND HUGE AND PRETENTIOUS, BUT OWENS IS ACTUALLY IN THE POSITION OF BEING ABLE TO AFFECT BROADER SOCIETAL CHANGE, ALBEIT AT A GENTLE PACE, GRINDING UP A FEW OF THOSE DECREPIT, CONSERVATIVE STIGMAS ABOUT GENDER AND SEXUALITY STILL HANGING ON AMONG THE PADLOCK-MINDED. IMAGINE IF PREJUDICE OF ANY KIND ONE DAY ENDED BECAUSE RICK OWENS&rsquo; INSTAGRAM, FULL OF IDOLS LIKE THE DIVINE DAVID, WAS SO MEGA? FOR A DESIGNER WHO MOSTLY CREATES THINGS IN SHADES OF VARIOUS DECAY, HE REALLY COLOURS THE WORLD IN. &nbsp; &ldquo;WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND I SAW THE PARTY SCENE IN&nbsp;THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, I PHYSICALLY ACHED TO BE PART OF THAT GROUP OF CHEERFULLY DEGENERATE WEIRDOS,&rdquo; REMEMBERS OWENS. &ldquo;NOW WHEN I SEE THE PEOPLE ENTERING MY SHOWS, I THINK, &lsquo;F CK, I KIND OF DID IT.&rsquo;&rdquo; &nbsp; &ldquo;IF YOUR PRIORITY IS HAVING A FULL CLOSET WITH TONNES OF STUFF IN IT, THEN MAYBE I&rsquo;M NOT YOUR GUY,&rdquo; HE CONTINUES. &ldquo;BUT IF IT&rsquo;S ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH YOU EDIT CAREFULLY AND HAS A STORY THEN I AM YOUR GUY. IT&rsquo;S ABOUT COMMITTING YOURSELF COMPLETELY TO AN AESTHETIC &ndash; THROWING YOURSELF INTO IT AND NOT LOOKING BACK. IN ALL FACETS OF YOUR LIFE, IF YOU&rsquo;RE GOING TO DO IT, GO ALL THE WAY. THAT WAS ALWAYS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. I STILL DON&rsquo;T UNDERSTAND IT WHEN I SEE DESIGNERS DO THESE EXTRAVAGANZAS ON THE RUNWAY, HAVING SENT THESE BOYS OUT IN ALL THESE CRAZY THINGS, AND THEY COME OUT AT THE END IN, LIKE, JEANS AND A SWEATSHIRT.&rdquo; LET IT BE SAID, YOU SHOULD NEVER, EVER TRUST A DESIGNER WHO DOESN&rsquo;T WEAR THEIR OWN COLLECTION. IF THEY DON&rsquo;T HAVE THE CONVICTION TO STAND INSIDE THEIR OWN MESSAGE, WHY SHOULD ANYONE ELSE? &nbsp; AS A KID GROWING UP IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, OWENS WANTED TO BE A PAINTER. (YOU COULD SAY HE&rsquo;S AN ARTIST, BECAUSE FASHION IS THE THEATRE OF LIFE.) &ldquo;IT WAS PRETTY CONSERVATIVE AND I WAS PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE THERE THE ENTIRE TIME,&rdquo; HE SAYS. &ldquo;BUT HAVING AN UNCOMFORTABLE CHILDHOOD MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING ADULTHOOD, I THINK. IF I HAD KIDS I WOULD WANT TO PROTECT THEM FROM ANY SHAME OR FEAR, BUT WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I&rsquo;D HAD A COMPLETELY WELL-ADJUSTED CHILDHOOD? I WOULDN&rsquo;T HAVE THE RAGE, I WOULDN&rsquo;T HAVE THE VENGEANCE THAT I FEEL NOW.&rdquo; &nbsp; HAVING ESTABLISHED HIS LABEL IN LOS ANGELES IN 1994, OWENS RELOCATED TO PARIS IN THE EARLY 00S WITH HIS WIFE, THE WONDERFUL, EQUALLY CREATIVE&nbsp;MICH&Egrave;LE LAMY&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;THE MOST PUNK-ROCK ELEMENT THAT WE&rsquo;VE GOT. SHE CANNOT BE TAMED,&rdquo; HE RHAPSODISES. FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVED LIVING IN HOLLYWOOD, HE DOESN&rsquo;T DO CELEBRITY PLACEMENT &ndash; IF YOU SEE A FILM STAR IN RICK LEATHER, THEY BOUGHT IT THEMSELVES. AS THEY SHOULD. &nbsp; OWENS&rsquo; VISION HAS STRUCK SUCH A CHORD (AND BECOME SO ESTABLISHED) THAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO BUY THE FACTORIES IN ITALY THAT MAKE HIS GARMENTS. HE HAS DIRECTLY OPERATED STORES IN LA, MIAMI, NEW YORK, LONDON, PARIS, MILAN, HONG KONG, SEOUL AND TOKYO. STILL ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT, HE DESIGNS EVERY RICK OWENS PRODUCT YOU CAN BUY &ndash; GREAT FASHION IS ABOUT DICTATORSHIP, AFTER ALL, NOT A COMMITTEE. THERE IS NO GHOST TEAM LOITERING AND KNOCKING OUT KEYRINGS HERE. EVEN THE COFFEE WE DRANK EARLIER HE POURED WITH HIS OWN HANDS. &nbsp; IF OWENS HAS ONE EXTRAVAGANCE, IT IS ART. HE DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE A COLLECTION OF VINTAGE CARS, OR INDEED A COLLECTION OF ANYTHING, PREFERRING TO BE FREE FROM THE BURDEN OF STUFF. HE WEARS THE SAME RICK OWENS LOOK, HIS &lsquo;UNIFORM&rsquo;, EVERY DAY, HIS WARDROBE FULL OF THINGS IN MULTIPLE, LIKE BART SIMPSON&rsquo;S. A FEW WEEKS BEFORE OUR MEETING, WHEN OWENS WAS IN ITALY WORKING ON THE AW16 MENSWEAR COLLECTION, WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE. HE WAS EXCITED ABOUT A PAINTING HE&rsquo;D GOT AT AUCTION BY STEVEN PARRINO, AN ARTIST WHOSE WORK HE ADMIRES. &ldquo;CONTEMPORARY ART ISN&rsquo;T MY THING,&rdquo; HE SAYS. &ldquo;I LOVE THE GLAMOUR AND WIT OF WHAT I SEE IN ART FAIRS AND I SEE THE ATTRACTION OF FEELING CONNECTED TO THE MOMENT, BUT I NEED TO SEE AN ARTIST&rsquo;S OEUVRE BEFORE I CAN REALLY COMMIT &ndash; I NEED TO SEE THAT THERE WAS A STEADY DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIQUE VOICE.&rdquo; THE LATTER STATEMENT COULD JUST AS EASILY BE USED TO DESCRIBE HIS OWN ACHIEVEMENT IN CULTURE. &nbsp; &ldquo;PROVENANCE IS A BIG PART OF MY ATTRACTION. I NEED THE ROMANCE OF THE ERA (A PIECE) CAME FROM AND THE SUBTLE REFERENCES OF THAT GENERATION&hellip; AND I PROBABLY NEED THE MELANCHOLY OF ALL OF THAT BEING EXTINGUISHED AND NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE. I&rsquo;M NOT REALLY A COLLECTOR, BECAUSE I LIKE ELIMINATING MORE THAN ACCUMULATING, BUT I DO HAVE A FEW BEAUTIFUL THINGS AROUND ME.&rdquo; &nbsp; HE IS ALSO FOND OF UPPERCASE, WHICH YOU&rsquo;LL KNOW IF YOU FOLLOW THE RICK OWENS&nbsp;INSTAGRAM&nbsp;OR TWITTER. WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT, WHEN HE EMAILS YOU PERSONALLY, THAT&rsquo;S ALL WRITTEN IN CAPITAL LETTERS TOO. YOU CAN&rsquo;T KNOCK HIM FOR CONSISTENCY. &nbsp; &ldquo;I LIKE HOW THINGS ALMOST COME OUT LIKE A PROCLAMATION,&rdquo; HE SAYS. &ldquo;I MIGHT HAVE IT COMPLETELY WRONG BECAUSE I KNOW TO SOME PEOPLE IT&rsquo;S JUST SHOUTING, BUT TO ME IT&rsquo;S KIND OF A CHEERFUL PROCLAMATION. EVERYTHING I SAY IS KIND OF LIKE, A LITTLE ARTIFICIAL AND HAPPY. ALMOST LIKE A CHILD SPEAKING TOO LOUDLY IN CHURCH.&rdquo; &nbsp; EXCEPT NO ONE&rsquo;S GONNA TELL HIM OFF. IT&rsquo;S A PLEASURE LISTENING. &nbsp; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

THEN I WAKE UP AND START MY WORK DAY AGAIN AT 6 P.M.” THE PROLIFIC DESIGNER AND ARTIST IS SPEAKING FROM THE RURAL TOWN OUTSIDE OF BOLOGNA, ITALY, WHERE HIS CLOTHES ARE PRODUCED. “I’M WORKING ON MEN’S RUNWAY AND STARTING WOMEN’S SPRING,” HE SAID. MANY DESIGNERS GRIPE ABOUT THE INCREASING NUMBER OF SHOWS AND COLLECTIONS, BUT OWENS SAID, “I LOVE THE STIMULATION. IT KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES, LIKE BOXING. YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN ALL AROUND YOU.” INDEED, HE ALSO HAS A SHOW OPENING AT LOS ANGELES’ MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART, OR MOCA, ON DEC. 17 TITLED “RICK OWENS: FURNITURE,” WHICH WILL BE ON VIEW THROUGH APRIL 2 AT MOCA’S PACIFIC DESIGN CENTER SPACE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. BUT, HE EXPLAINED, THE REAL CREATIVE FORCE BEHIND THE SHOW IS HIS WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY, WHO IS CURRENTLY HERE INSTALLING IT. (A TWITTER POST ON THURSDAY SHOWED KANYE WEST SITTING ON A STILL-CRATED, CARVED OX BONE OWENS CHAIR AT THE MUSEUM.) “IT’S AN INTIMATE EXERCISE, A CONVERSATION BETWEEN ME AND MICHELE,” OWENS SAID OF THEIR DESIGN PROCESS. THEY BEGAN MAKING FURNITURE IN 2007 AND THE EXHIBIT CONTAINS ABOUT 20 PERCENT CLASSIC PIECES AND 80 PERCENT NEW WORKS, MANY OF WHICH THEY CONCEIVED FOR HIS NEWEST STORE IN NEW YORK’S SOHO. “IT WAS NEVER A COMMERCIAL IDEA. WE JUST DID IT BECAUSE WE COULD. IT’S THE WAY WE PLAY.” OWENS SAID HE COMES UP WITH DRAWINGS, THEN PASSES THE BALL TO LAMY, WHO HAS MODELS MADE, WHICH THEY BOTH THEN CARVE AND RE-PROPORTION BEFORE LAMY ENLISTS ARTISANS TO CREATE THE MOSTLY LARGE-SCALE PIECES FROM MARBLE, ALABASTER, BRONZE, LEATHER AND PLYWOOD. THIS SHOW MARKS THEIR FIRST FORAY INTO MATERIALS SUCH AS FOAM, ROCK CRYSTAL AND CONCRETE. “ONE DAY FOR CHRISTMAS I AM GOING TO GET MICHELE HER OWN CRANE. SHE LOVES HEAVY MACHINERY,” HE NOTED. IT’S LAMY’S EXECUTION, HE SAID, THAT MAKES THE PIECES SPECIAL. “I DON’T OVERESTIMATE MY CREATIVITY AT ALL. NINETY-FIVE PERCENT IS THE EXECUTION. IN THIS CASE IT IS VERY MUCH ABOUT HER ENERGY. SHE’S A MAGICAL FAIRY WITCH WHO NEEDS TO GO OUT THERE AND CONNECT WITH PEOPLE, FIGHT WITH THEM, THROW HER JEWELRY AT THEM,” HE SAID. IF IT SEEMS LIKE A MONUMENTAL WAY TO SPEND ONES’ LEISURE TIME, IT’S BECAUSE MORE PEDESTRIAN ACTS OF GOOFING AROUND DON’T COME NATURALLY TO OWENS. “I TAKE LIFE A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY, PERHAPS. I’M GOOD AT DEDICATION AND DISCIPLINE, BUT I FEEL WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE THE TIME WE’VE GOT AND PLAY. THIS IS WHAT WORKS FOR ME.” OWENS SAID HE’LL LEAVE IT TO LAMY TO INSTALL THE SHOW AND GLORY IN ITS OPENING. HIS PIECES WILL BE SHOWN ALONGSIDE A SELECTION OF WORKS BY THE LATE ARTIST AND MUSICIAN STEVEN PARRINO, WHOSE CANVASES CONTAIN THEMES OF DETACHING, TWISTING AND DISTORTING THE MATERIAL SIMILAR TO THOSE IN OWENS’ CLOTHES. “I WANT HER TO ENJOY ALL OF THIS ON HER TERMS,” HE SAID. “I’VE GOT A S–TLOAD OF THINGS TO DO OVER HERE, AND SOCIALIZING WOULD BE THIS DISTRACTION. I HAVE TO BE FORCED TO COME TO NEW YORK AND L.A. BECAUSE THERE IS A SOCIAL KIND OF HYSTERIA THERE THAT IS NOT MY COMFORT ZONE. BUT I’M NOT SHY.” PLUS, HE SAID, “I LIKE HER SUMMARIES BETTER THAN EXPERIENCING IT MYSELF.” INSTEAD, HE’LL GET TO WORK ON HIS NEXT MUSEUM EXHIBIT: A SHOW AT THE 2018 MILAN TRIENNALE THAT WILL BE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT HIS FASHION OEUVRE AND HIS FURNITURE. ACCORDING TO HIM, “IT’S ONE OF THOSE CLOTHES-ON-A-MANNEQUIN, WORLD-OF-THE-DESIGNER SHOWS.” GIVEN THAT OWENS IS PRONE TO COMPLEX ANALYSES OF HIS OWN WORK, COUNT ON IT TO BE INTERESTING. “IT’S A BIG, BEAUTIFUL SPACE. I’M GOING THERE NEXT WEEK TO LOOK AT IT,” HE SAID. “I LOVE BEING ABLE TO MANIPULATE SPACE AND CREATE A UTOPIAN VISION. I’M COMPLETELY AWARE OF THE POIGNANCY OF REACHING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS UNATTAINABLE. THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF UTOPIAS. IT’S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY’RE CORRUPTED.” HE PAUSED, BEFORE ADDING, “I’M FULLY AWARE IT’S BASED ON EGO AND VANITY, BUT WHILE YOU ARE ON EARTH, IT’S SOMETHING GOOD DO WITH YOUR TIME. BUSY HANDS ARE HAPPY HANDS.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

I’M USING RARE MATERIALS AND ARTISANS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS TO CREATE UNIQUE, ONE-OF-A-KIND OBJECTS.” IT’S A FORBIDDING DESIGN ETHOS WORLDS AWAY FROM THE PLUSH FURNISHINGS TYPICALLY TROTTED OUT BY FASHION DESIGNERS. ROOTED IN ARTISTRY RATHER THAN LIFESTYLE, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON SCULPTURE OVER COMFORT, THE MASSIVE MONUMENTS AREN’T ASSEMBLED SO MUCH AS CARVED OUT OF HEAVY ROCK — MARBLE, BASALT, CRYSTAL, AND OTHER ELEMENTS OWENS DEEMS “BIBLICAL” — WITH NARY A NAP IN SIGHT, SAVE FOR A BIT OF CAMEL-FUR UPHOLSTERY. IN ADDITION TO MILLENNIA-IN-THE-MAKING MATERIALS, THE SHOW INCLUDES WORKS IN CAST CONCRETE, PLYWOOD, AND FOAM. “I LOVE THE CONTRAST OF BIG, CHEAP FOAM MODELS NEXT TO A WILDLY EXPENSIVE RARE CRYSTAL ROCK,” HE SAID. MOST OF THE PIECES IN THE SHOW ARE NEW, WHILE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY TRAVELED THE INTERNATIONAL ART CIRCUIT. YET THE COLLECTION AS A WHOLE HAS STRAYED LITTLE FROM OWENS’ ORIGINAL VISION WHEN HE FIRST STARTED CRAFTING FURNITURE IN 2007. “BACK THEN, I HAD IN MIND THE FUR ON A ROCK NEXT TO A FIRE IN A CAVE. THAT’S HOW THE BOULDER BECAME OUR SIGNATURE.” THAT TROGLODYTIC BLOCK HAS SINCE MORPHED INTO A CHAIR, A BENCH, A DAYBED — EACH MORE MONOLITHIC THAN THE LAST. THE LATEST INCARNATION, AS SEEN AT MOCA, BORROWS ITS SHAPE FROM THE CONCRETE GERMAN BUNKERS THAT POPPED UP ON THE COAST OF NORMANDY DURING WORLD WAR II. “THEY LOOK LIKE FUTURISTIC TEMPLES,” OWENS SAID, RECALLING A TRIP HE TOOK TO INSPECT THEM FIRST-HAND. “THEY’RE LOW WITH NARROW SLITS AND DOORWAYS, AND VERY SQUARE WITH WEIRD ROUNDED CORNERS. THEY HAVE NO ORNAMENTATION, BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE THESE ALMOST CATHEDRAL-LIKE BUTTRESSES. TO ME THEY’RE THE BIRTH OF BRUTALISM.” WHILE OWENS HAS IMBUED THE RIGOROUSLY REDUCTIVIST BRUTALIST AESTHETIC INTO EVERYTHING HE PRODUCES, HE CREDITS HIS WIFE AND CREATIVE PARTNER MICHÈLE LAMY WITH THE FURNITURE’S EXISTENCE. THEIR RESPECTFUL DIVISION OF ROLES GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS: HE DRAWS HIS IDEAS ON PAPER, AND THE TWO DO SOME SMALL-SCALE PROTOTYPING AT HOME “WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE AND REALLY LOVING HANDS.” THEN, A DEALER SOURCES THE ELEMENTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD — ROCK CRYSTAL FROM PAKISTAN, ALABASTER FROM SPAIN — AND LAMY, 70-SOMETHING, SPRINGS INTO ACTION. “EVERY MORNING,” SAID OWENS, LETTING OUT A CHUCKLE, “SHE JUMPS IN THE VAN AND HEADS TO THE ÉBÉNISTERIE OR MARBRERIE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS.” THERE, SHE OVERSEES EVERY STEP OF THE HEROIC PRODUCTION EFFORT. COLOSSAL STONE SLABS, WHICH EASILY WEIGH A TON OR TWO, UNDERGO LARGE-SCALE LASER-CARVING AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES. “IT’S ALL VERY ORGANIZED,” OWENS STRESSED. “IT’S NOT LIKE WE’RE DRAGGING STUFF BACK AND POLISHING IT OURSELVES.” THE IDEA FOR THE EXHIBITION CAME ABOUT WHILE OWENS WAS PLANNING TO RELOCATE HIS NEW YORK STORE. “THE HUDSON STREET LOCATION SATISFIED MY APPETITE FOR AUSTERITY, SO WE DECIDED TO MOVE TO HOWARD. I TOLD MICHÈLE WE SHOULD BE COMPLETELY RECKLESS AND DO THE OPPOSITE OF AUSTERITY. I SAID, &#39;LET’S TEAR THIS UP.&#39; AND WHO BETTER TO TEAR THINGS UP THAN MICHÈLE?” HE SAID. “SHE’S A FREE SPIRIT WHO HATES TO BE TAMED OR CONTROLLED. I SAID, &#39;WHY DON’T YOU USE THE SPACE TO EXPERIMENT WITH NEW SHAPES, NEW MATERIALS, NEW PROPORTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO MOCA. LET’S EXAGGERATE, DISTORT, AND REINTERPRET&#39; — AND THAT’S WHAT SHE DID.” SO INSTRUMENTAL IS LAMY THAT SHE ALONE IS CHARGED WITH INSTALLING THE EXHIBITION AT MOCA PACIFIC DESIGN CENTER, WHILE OWENS SITS OUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS, OPENING AND ALL. “WHY NOT?” HE SAID. “SHE’S HAVING A BLAST. I DON’T KNOW IF I CAN EVER DRAG HER BACK.” NOT THAT THEIR DELICATE BALANCING ACT HAS ALWAYS LED TO DOMESTIC BLISS. WHEN I ASKED ABOUT A ROCK-CRYSTAL TOILET HE ONCE TOLD ME HE WANTED TO MAKE, HE ADOPTED AN ALMOST SHEEPISH TONE. “I DON’T THINK MICHÈLE WAS INTO THAT. I’D KEEP NAGGING HER AND SHE’D SNAP AT ME AND SHUT ME UP ABOUT IT. IT WAS A LITTLE POINT OF CONTENTION. FINALLY I GOT AN APARTMENT IN VENICE, WHERE I SPEND EACH SUMMER, AND I KNEW I COULD DO WHATEVER I WANTED THERE. I THOUGHT I’D FINALLY MAKE THE ROCK-CRYSTAL TOILET,” HE RECALLED. “BUT I ONLY DID A BLACK ITALIAN MARBLE VERSION BECAUSE I JUST COULDN’T BRING MYSELF TO DO IT IN ROCK CRYSTAL. IT FELT UNFAITHFUL.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

I HAD A CONSERVATIVE, CONTROLLED CHILDHOOD, THEN BECAME AS UNCONTROLLED AS I COULD, THEN REALISED THAT I LIKED CONTROL AFTER ALL. THIS IS THE STORY OF MY GENERATION: KIDS THAT WERE TOO CONTROLLED AND THEN BECAME DRUG ADDICTS AND ALCOHOLICS BEFORE FINDING SPIRITUALITY AND ZEN. IT’S SO COMMON. I’M TOTALLY COMMON. I WAS PRETTY EFFEMINATE AND SENSITIVE AS A BOY. IT’S THAT SAME OLD STORY: SENSITIVE BOY IN A SMALL TOWN, TRYING TO FIT IN. I FELT THREATENED PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME. GROWING UP, THERE WAS A CERTAIN SET OF RULES OR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW TO BEHAVE. THAT ANGERED ME, AND LATER ON I FELT VENGEFUL. I TRIED TO CONFORM, BUT I NEVER MANAGED TO DO IT VERY SUCCESSFULLY. I WAS FORCED TO BEND, TO ACT IN A WAY THAT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH. THEIR RULES DIDN’T SEEM FAIR. THEY WERE LIMITING AND UPTIGHT AND DIDN’T MAKE SENSE. I HAD TO BECOME MORE MASCULINE. I COULDN’T BE FLAMBOYANT; I HAD TO BUTCH IT UP. IT WAS HUMILIATING. IN A WAY I SUPPOSE IT HELPED ME FORM A SENSE OF DEFIANCE AND REBELLION AND WHEN I LEFT TO GO TO ART SCHOOL IN THE BIG CITY, I BECAME AS FLAMBOYANT AS I POSSIBLY COULD. I LIVED IN A WAREHOUSE BY THE RAILROAD TRACKS IN LA. YOU HAD TO CLIMB IN FROM A SET OF STAIRS. I HAD THIS GREAT CAR WITH FINS ON IT. I WORE PLATFORM BOOTS AND CAPES AND FULL MAKEUP. I WORE GLOVES TO BED. BUT WHEN I WENT BACK HOME TO PORTERVILLE TO SEE MY PARENTS, I’D TAKE OFF ALL THE MAKEUP AND NAIL POLISH AND PUT ON NORMAL CLOTHES. WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT OF GOING TO THEIR HOUSE AND PROVOKING THEM? IF I WANTED TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM, I HAD TO COMPROMISE. THAT ISN’T A BAD THING. AND IN THE LATER YEARS, WHEN I WAS COMPLETELY HONEST WITH THEM AND ALLOWED THEM INTO MY LIFE, THEY HAD TO MAKE SOME COMPROMISES TOO. THAT WAS LOVELY. IN A WAY, IT WAS THE MONEY THAT MADE THEM CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT ME. (LAUGHS.) MY PARENTS FIGURED, WELL AS LONG AS HE’S SUCCESSFUL HE MUST BE OKAY. IT WAS KIND OF BITTERSWEET BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A FALSE CONTEXT, BUT THEN LIFE ISN’T PERFECT. I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD, TO BE INVOLVED. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WAS TIMID AND HAD A PROBLEM FITTING IN SO I DRANK TO GIVE MYSELF COURAGE, BUT I’VE ALWAYS FOUND A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE WORLD. THE WORLD THAT I PROPOSE TO PEOPLE IS NOT MEANT TO IMPOSE OR INSIST. IT’S NOT A MANIFESTO, IT’S A PROPOSAL. IT’S MEANT TO BE GENTLE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS BORN OUT OF MY REACTION TO THE RULES IMPOSED ON ME, I WANT IT TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE, NOT THE ONLY OPTION. THAT’S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. I LIKE ARTIFICE. I DON’T MEAN LIPSTICK AND BOTOX — I’M TALKING EXAGGERATION AND ENHANCING IDEAS, RATHER THAN TRYING TO LOOK YOUNG. THINK OF KABUKI OR THE ARTIFICE OF A ROOM WITH A SCROLL ON THE WALL AND ONE FLOWER ARRANGEMENT. A TEA CEREMONY: ARTIFICE AS FORMALISED RITUAL. WELL, MAYBE IT’S NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM BOTOX AND LIPSTICK AFTER ALL. MAYBE IT’S WRONG OF ME TO THINK THAT ONE IS MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THE OTHER — I DON’T WANT TO BE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO CLAIMS TO KNOW WHAT THE RULES REALLY ARE. I HATE SOUNDING OPINIONATED EVEN THOUGH I PROBABLY AM. THE ARTIFICE I LIKE IS ALWAYS EXAGGERATED AND BORDERLINE RIDICULOUS. IT’S CHALLENGING THE CODES OF GOOD TASTE AND NOTIONS OF CONSERVATIVE BEAUTY IN A GOOD-HUMOURED WAY. HUMOUR IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEGANT THINGS IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE, YOU KNOW. I’M A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH GREY CURLY HAIR THAT HAS BEEN CHEMICALLY ALTERED TO BE BLACK, STRAIGHT AND LONG. I’M A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO HAS GONE TO THE GYM FOR TWENTY YEARS: I’VE ALTERED MY BODY IN A VERY CALCULATED WAY THROUGH STEROIDS AND WORKING OUT. I STARTED GOING BECAUSE I WAS DRINKING SO MUCH THAT I HAD TO BALANCE THAT OUT, BUT ALSO BECAUSE I WANTED TO CHANGE MY BODY. I JUST WASN’T HAPPY WITH IT AS IT WAS. MY WIFE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO THE GYM, AND SHE PUSHED ME TO GO TOO. TODAY IT’S AS REGULAR AS BRUSHING MY TEETH, JUST SOMETHING I DO TO FEEL RIGHT. A GROOMING HABIT. I’M NOT SAYING MY BODY IS PERFECT, BUT IT’S AS PERFECT AS I CAN MAKE IT. I DON’T NEED TO RELY ON CLOTHES TO HIDE FLAWS OR MAKE IT LOOK BETTER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS. I’M ALSO VERY COMFORTABLE WITH MY FEMININE SIDE NOW. I’M DEFINITELY AN OLD QUEEN. I WOULDN’T SAY MY CLOTHES ARE RADICAL, BUT FOR SOMEBODY MY AGE I SUPPOSE THEY’RE A LITTLE BIT RIDICULOUS. WHAT I WEAR IS A LOGICAL ANSWER TO THE WAY I LIVE AND WHAT I NEED TO DO. I DON’T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING I WANT TO SAY EVERY DAY WITH MY CLOTHES SO THEY’VE BECOME A SORT OF UNIFORM. I HAVE TWENTY COPIES OF THE SAME OUTFIT. I WEAR SNEAKERS OF MY OWN DESIGN. I’VE BECOME VERY KNOWN FOR SNEAKERS, WHICH IS IRONIC CONSIDERING THAT WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING THEM IT WAS ALMOST A PARODY. I THOUGHT SNEAKERS WERE THE MOST BORING THINGS ON THE PLANET. THEY REPRESENTED COMPLETE BANALITY TO ME. BUT I WAS GOING TO THE GYM AND I NEEDED SOME SO I STARTED DOING MY OWN EXAGGERATED VERSION, AND THEY’VE BECOME A SIGNATURE OF MINE. IT’S ONE OF THE THINGS I SELL THE MOST OF NOW. THE ONES I WEAR ARE ON A STRETCH LEATHER SOCK: THEY’RE KIND OF A SNEAKER COMBINED WITH AN OPERA LEATHER GLOVE. I WEAR THOSE, AND BAGGY SHORTS THAT END BELOW MY KNEES. THE SNEAKER-SOCKS COVER MY KNEES BECAUSE I THINK IT’S A BIT RUDE TO SHOW BARE, HAIRY KNEES EVERYWHERE. IT’S MORE DISCREET TO COVER UP. I ALSO WEAR A SILK JERSEY TANK TOP AND A BLACK CASHMERE TURTLENECK. WHEN I GO TO THE GYM, I JUST TAKE MY SWEATER OFF AND PUSH MY SOCKS DOWN AND I HAVE MY GYM OUTFIT. I DON’T REALLY DO ANYTHING THAT CARDIOVASCULAR, JUST WEIGHTS AND STRETCHING SO I DON’T GET SWEATY. IT’S ALL VERY PRACTICAL. MY SHORTS OBVIOUSLY REFERENCE SKATEBOARDERS OR MEXICAN GANGS IN LA FROM THE &#39;80S, OR THEY CAN REFERENCE A SORT OF BUDDHIST MONK SITUATION. THE BLACK TURTLENECK COULD BE READ AS A REFERENCE TO THE BEATS IN SAINT-GERMAIN IN THE 1960S: IT’S ARCHITECTURAL, FORMAL AND SEVERE. OVER THAT I ALWAYS WEAR A BLACK BOMBER IN NYLON, PARTLY BECAUSE MONTANA ALWAYS WORE ONE IN THE &#39;80S, AND PARTLY BECAUSE LEATHER HAS BECOME TOO HEAVY FOR ME. THE TANK TOP DOESN’T REPRESENT ANYTHING. IN SHORT, I’M A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN WEARING EVENING GLOVE RUNNING SHOES WITH SHORTS — PROBABLY NOT EVERY 55-YEAR-OLD MAN’S DREAM LOOK. (LAUGHS.) BUT FOR BETTER OR WORSE I’VE ESTABLISHED MYSELF AS A FASHION DESIGNER IN PARIS, AND AS SUCH YOU’RE EXPECTED TO UPHOLD SOME KIND OF AESTHETIC ECCENTRICITY. IF I SHOWED UP IN A SUIT, PEOPLE WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED. I’M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN CLOTHES, FOR ME PERSONALLY I MEAN. I NEVER BUY THEM. YOU KNOW, THE INTERIOR DESIGNER JEAN-MICHEL FRANK HAD FORTY IDENTICAL GREY FLANNEL SUITS IN HIS CLOSET: I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS THE HEIGHT OF MODESTY AND EXTRAVAGANCE AT THE SAME TIME. I LOVE THAT. I DON’T REMEMBER WHEN I DECIDED TO START WEARING THIS UNIFORM BUT I’VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME. IN THE &#39;90S I WORE TIGHT BLACK JEANS, BLACK PLATFORMS, A BLACK T-SHIRT AND A LEATHER JACKET. THAT WAS MY UNIFORM THEN. AFTER THAT I WORE ARMY SURPLUS SHORTS OVER SWEATPANTS WITH A T-SHIRT AND A LEATHER COAT FOR A LONG TIME, PROBABLY UNTIL I CAME TO PARIS. IN PARIS I REPLACED THE LEATHER COAT WITH A SABLE-LINED ONE, BUT I STILL WORE ARMY SURPLUS PANTS. EVENTUALLY THAT MORPHED INTO WHAT I WEAR TODAY. I HAVE A SET LOOK FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEN I MAKE A CHANGE. WHEN I SEE PEOPLE CHANGING STYLES ALL THE TIME, IT MAKES ME WONDER: DON’T YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE? I DON’T MEAN TO BE CRITICAL, BUT I QUESTION THEIR SINCERITY. IN MY UNIFORM I CAN GO ANYWHERE — TO THE OPERA OR TO A RAVE. THERE ARE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN I ALTER IT, OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE SITUATION. I WENT TO A STATE DINNER AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS YEAR, AND I WORE MY SHORTS AND SNEAKERS BUT WITH A LONG BLACK SILK DUCHESSE BLAZER AND A BLACK SILK TURTLENECK. I DIDN’T WANT TO BE RUDE. I WANT TO LIVE THE LIFE I WANT TO LIVE, BUT WHEN I GO TO SOMEBODY’S HOUSE I RESPECT THEIR VIBE. BEING POLITE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING DEFIANT. I DON’T WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. I’VE SHOWN NUDITY AND BIZARRE STUFF AT MY SHOWS BUT A FASHION SHOW IS A SOPHISTICATED AESTHETIC ARENA WHERE PEOPLE EXPECT A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE AND CHALLENGE. I WOULDN’T DO THOSE RUNWAY SHOWS FOR MY MOTHER’S CHURCH GROUP. THAT WOULD NOT BE POLITE. I&#39;M ALWAYS A BIT IRRITATED BECAUSE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEN’S FASHION IS ESSENTIALLY CONSERVATIVE WITH JUST A HINT OF REBELLION. IMAGINE SOMETHING CLASSIC, BUT WITH A RIPPED LINING OR A HIDDEN STRAP THAT IMPLIES S&amp;M. THAT’S PROBABLY THE STUFF THAT SELLS THE MOST IN STORES. I SUPPOSE I CAN BE ACCUSED OF DOING CLOTHES LIKE THAT MYSELF SOMETIMES. IT’S A FUNNY PERIOD FOR MENSWEAR. IT’S SO POPULAR AND YET SO RESTRAINED. WE’RE SO PRUDISH TODAY. I DON’T KNOW WHY THE CATWALK ISN’T MORE EXAGGERATED — I GUESS FLAMBOYANCE RAN ITS COURSE. ALTHOUGH, ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONS FOR MY MEN’S CLOTHES IS NEIL YOUNG. HE DOESN’T CARE ABOUT DRESSING UP. HE’S A POET AND HE’S MASCULINE BUT HE’S SENSITIVE TOO. HE SEEMS HONEST, WITH A SENSE OF HONOUR, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST APPEALING THINGS TO LOOK FOR IN A MAN. IN A VERY PRIMAL WAY WE STILL WANT MEN TO MOVE ROCKS AND WOMEN TO BRING THE CIVILISATION. FASHION IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT’S A MYSTERY. IT’S THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE SUBTLE THINGS WE PROPOSE AS DESIGNERS, AND THAT PEOPLE RESPOND TO LIKE FLOCKS OF BIRDS TURNING ALL OF A SUDDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SKY. THAT’S WHAT MAKES IT FASCINATING. IT’S ALL ABOUT INSTINCTS AND SUBTLE REFERENCES THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN GRASP IN A VERY VAGUE WAY. IT’S A PATTERN OR CODE THAT IS UNDERSTOOD BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME. TO BE A DESIGNER YOU HAVE TO CHANGE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN INTEREST, BUT NOT CHANGE SO MUCH THAT YOU COME OFF AS INSINCERE. IT’S A TRICKY BALANCING ACT. I WONDER WHEN THE DAY WILL COME WHEN I NO LONGER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS RELEVANT IN THE WORLD, AND I CONTINUE REFINING A VISION THAT’S NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT. WE’VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN, AND I DREAD THE DAY IT HAPPENS TO ME. MY FATHER DIED THIS YEAR SO I’VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT MORTALITY. HE WAS A VERY CONFRONTATIONAL MAN, VERY ANALYTICAL. HE LIKED PUTTING PEOPLE INTO A CORNER INTELLECTUALLY — IT WAS A FORM OF BULLYING. HE COULD BE SO CRITICAL OF THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIVES AND IN THE END HE BECAME VERY BITTER. I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO ASK HIM WHY HE, AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS OF THINKING, COULDN’T FIND SERENITY. HE WASN’T ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE ENDING OF HIS LIFE IN A GRACEFUL WAY. HE WAS SO OBSERVANT, AND HE BELIEVED IN BEING A RESOLVED HUMAN BEING — SOMEONE WHO THINKS CORRECTLY — AND STILL HE NEVER MANAGED TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS DYING. IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE WORLD AND ABOUT HOW TO FIND GRACEFUL WAYS TO DEAL WITH THREATS. THAT’S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO. I’D LIKE TO END UP IN A GARDEN WITH A WALL AROUND IT, READING AND PLAYING WITH KITTENS. THAT’S PROBABLY THE BEST I CAN HOPE FOR. I’M NOT GOING TO HAVE GRANDCHILDREN. WELL, I GUESS IN A WAY I WILL BECAUSE I SURROUND MYSELF WITH PEOPLE, AND SOME ARE HAVING CHILDREN. I LOVE SEEING BABIES AROUND. SO I SUPPOSE I WILL HAVE THE COMFORT OF BEING IN A GARDEN AND PLAYING WITH KITTENS AND BABIES. I DON’T KNOW WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE BETTER THAN THAT.

PERCHED ON THE BEACHFRONT OF LIDO, IN A QUIET AREA SOUTH OF THE MAIN TOURIST HUB, THE PISTACHIO FAÇADE OF THE BUILDING GIVES NOTHING AWAY. THERE IS NO BELL, JUST SUSPICIOUS NEIGHBOURS. SO WHEN I CALL RICK TO ANNOUNCE MY ARRIVAL, HE BOUNDS DOWNSTAIRS BAREFOOT—DISTINCTLY OUT OF PLACE IN THIS MODEST ENCLAVE—TO MUCH TWITCHING OF CURTAINS. HERE HE IS, POISED AND ATHLETIC; LONG DARK HAIR GRAZING MUSCLED SHOULDERS THE COLOUR OF POLISHED MAHOGANY. AT 53 HE APPEARS YOUNGER, ALTHOUGH IT’S CLEARLY TAKEN EFFORT TO LOOK THIS EFFORTLESS. A SCULPTED BODY LENDS HIM THE SUPPLENESS OF A SUPREMELY COMPOSED TAEKWONDO COACH, WHILE HIS DYED RAVEN LOCKS (“I’M ACTUALLY WHITE UNDER THIS”) AND MATCHING SUNTAN PERSONIFY THE OXYMORONIC ‘HEALTH GOTH’. HE IS CLAD TODAY IN SOMETHING OF HIS OWN DESIGN, A TRADEMARK JERSEY ENSEMBLE THAT COULD BE SHORTS AND A T-SHIRT, BUT THEN AGAIN MIGHT ALSO BE A CAREFULLY DRAPED SAMPLE HE’S BEEN WORKING ON THIS AFTERNOON. “I WEAR A VARIATION ON A THEME,” HE SMILES, “IT’S JUST EASIER THAT WAY.” WITH HIS ITALIAN ROOTS, LARGE ROMAN NOSE AND THIGH SKIMMING OUTFIT, THE LOOK IS GLADIATORIAL AND UNAPOLOGETIC. IT SUITS HIM. A NEIGHBOUR SWEEPS HER YARD, TRANSFIXED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS BURNISHED STALLION, YET OWENS SEEMS OBLIVIOUS TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIS OWN FABULOUS AURA. “ISN’T THIS KINDA STRANGE?” HE DRAWLS, GESTURING TO THE SURROUNDINGS. “LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN LE CORBUSIER AND MUSSOLINI. QUICK, LET’S GO INSIDE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS THEIR CAMERA OUT.” THE TOP FLOOR APARTMENT, NAVIGATED BY WAY OF A TINY LIFT, IS A REVELATION—A COOL, SMOOTH, EXPANSIVE SPACE THAT PROVIDES SUMMER SANCTUARY AWAY FROM HIS PARIS HEADQUARTERS, OR THE STORES OF MANHATTAN. THERE IS POLISHED CONCRETE (AN OWENS TRADEMARK) EVERYWHERE, TEMPERED BY PUTTY COLOURED MARBLE AND STRATEGICALLY PLACED MIRRORS. A PHALANX OF WHITE LEATHER SOFAS LINE ONE WALL, ON WHICH FUR THROWS ARE CASUALLY STREWN LIKE PROPS FROM A FELLINI MOVIE. AT A LARGE CENTRAL TABLE SITS HIS WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER, MICHÈLE LAMY, WORKING ON DESIGNS FOR THE OWENS FURNITURE LINE. THIS VISUALLY CAPTIVATING WOMAN—PART VOODOO PRIESTESS, PART CULT LEADER—IS OWENS’ MUSE AND CONFIDANTE, AND SOMEONE FOR WHOM THE TERM PRIMORDIAL CHIC COULD WELL HAVE BEEN INVENTED. AN OUTDOOR TERRACE PROVIDES PANORAMIC VIEWS OF SAN MARCO AND BEYOND. TO THE EAST, LOOKING OUT ONTO THE ADRIATIC SEA, HE POINTS OUT THE GRAND HOTEL DES BAINS, THE LOCATION FOR VISCONTI’S ELEGIAC MASTERPIECE, DEATH IN VENICE. “IT’S WHY I’M HERE,” HE SAYS, MESMERISED BY THE THOUGHT. “IT’S ONE OF THE MOST GLAMOROUS PLACES IN THE WORLD, AND THAT SCENE, WHERE DIRK BOGARDE SITS ON THE BEACH WITH MAKE-UP MELTING DOWN HIS FACE? WOW. THAT’S HOW I’M GOING TO GO. THAT’S MY PLAN.” RICK OWENS IS ONE OF THE WORLD’S MOST INTRIGUING, NOT TO MENTION SUCCESSFUL, FASHION DESIGNERS: A BEHEMOTH OF INDEPENDENT RETAILING, ALL THE MORE WORTHY WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW NICHE HIS OUTPUT IS. THE STEALTH WEALTHY, THE SERIOUSLY HIP AND THE SARTORIALLY OUTCAST (“MY BEAUTIFUL FREAKS”), ALL BUY INTO HIS SINGULAR AESTHETIC—A COLLISION OF GLAMOUR AND GRUNGE THAT’S SOLIDIFIED BY EXQUISITE LEATHER JACKETS, GEOMETRIC DRESSING, AND AN IRREGULAR TAKE ON THE CONCEPT OF SPORTSWEAR. THE PALETTE IS EARTHY, ALMOST PURITANICAL, THE FABRICS TACTILE AND TECHNICAL. FANS LAP UP THE ARCHITECTURAL REFERENCES, THE OBTUSE SHAPES AND LOW-KEY SENSIBILITY, ALL CLAMOURING TO SIGN UP TO THE CULT OF OWENS. THEY ARE AN ARTFUL BRIGADE, IN THRALL OF THEIR LEADER AND HIS ICONOCLASTIC VISION. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY VALUE AND ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR THIS TIMELESS, LUXURIOUS STYLE. “I LOVE THE FACT THAT’S WHAT PEOPLE GET FROM ME, BUT MY OWN TAKE ON LUXURY IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT,” HE EXPLAINS. “TIME, SPACE AND FREEDOM ARE THE THREE THINGS I VALUE MOST; BUT I WONDER HOW MANY OF US ARE REALLY FREE? WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS YOU ARE NO LONGER FREE. I SUSPECT THAT IF I EVER HAD KIDS I WOULD GET VERY INTENSE. I WOULD HOVER AND OVERPROTECT AND NOT HAVE THE PATIENCE. CHILDREN ARE WHAT MAKE YOU IMMORTAL, AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT URGE. BUT ALL THE DESIRE I’VE EVER HAD, I PUT INTO WHAT I MAKE. THOSE ARE MY CHILDREN. THAT’S WHERE I PUT MY ENERGY.” LAMY IS A FABULOUS HOST WITH EXQUISITE TASTE IN EVERYTHING, AND ALTHOUGH NEITHER OF THEM DRINK, SHE BRINGS OUT A BOTTLE OF SOMETHING WHITE, CHILLED AND EXPENSIVE. “I’M PRETTY REPRESSED,” SAYS OWENS, EYEING THE WINE WITH A COMPLETE LACK OF INTEREST. “I DON’T REMEMBER CRAVING ANYTHING FOR A LONG TIME. I USED TO BE A RAGING ALCOHOLIC, BUT I NO LONGER HAVE THOSE CRAVINGS. THAT PERIOD WAS ABOUT SELF-DESTRUCTION, AND NOW IT’S ABOUT CONTROL AND EXECUTING THINGS. BOTH THOSE THINGS ARE GREAT, BUT I HAVE OTHER APPETITES. DESIGNING AND CREATING ARE THE BEST THINGS I CAN BE DOING WITH MY TIME. IN AN EXAGGERATED WAY I COULD SAY THAT I LOVE TO INFECT THE WORLD WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MY STUFF. MODEST STATEMENTS THAT GO OUT THERE WITH INTEGRITY.” I GET THE SENSE OWENS WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY IN THRALL TO THE IDEA OF DESIGN, BUT CLOTHES AS SUCH ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN THAT SERIOUSLY. “I DON’T BELIEVE IN EXPLAINING YOUR WORK, IT EITHER SPEAKS TO YOU OR IT DOESN’T. I HATE ART THAT HAS TO BE EXPLAINED TO YOU—YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT OR FEEL IT. IF IT HAS TO BE EXPLAINED, THEN F CK IT.” HE LAUGHS AT THE ABSURDITY OF THE SITUATION, HOW SITTING HERE, MUSING ON SUCCESS AND HIS PLACE IN THE GRAND FIRMAMENT COULD COME ACROSS AS VAIN, BUT SEEMS TO REVEL IN THE INTERVIEW PROCESS NONETHELESS. HE IS VERBOSE, INTROSPECTIVE, AND A HIGHLY TUNED INDIVIDUAL, EQUALLY AT EASE DISCUSSING RADICAL DRAG AS HE IS HIGH ART. WE TALK OFF THE RECORD ABOUT HIS FRIENDSHIPS WITH CHER AND LIZA MINNELLI (“I LOVE THEM BOTH, THEY’RE MY KIND OF WOMEN”), THE RELATIVE MERITS OF CAITLYN JENNER (“MICHÈLE AND I IOVE THAT SHOW, IT’S COMPULSIVE VIEWING”) AND THE INHERENT POWER OF LONDON’S BARBICAN CENTRE (“IT’S JUST A FANTASTIC BUILDING, I CAN’T SAY ENOUGH NICE THINGS ABOUT IT”). HE IS CLEARLY A MAN WITH DISPARATE TASTE, BUT SOMEHOW, WHEN CHANNELLED THROUGH HIS INTELLECTUAL DESIGNS, OR TALKED UP IN CHARISMATIC STYLE, IT ALL STARTS TO MAKE SENSE. “I FEEL LIKE I’M THE BEST EXAMPLE OF ME” HE SAYS WITHOUT APOLOGY. “I FEEL LIKE I CAN SUMMARISE MY WHOLE WORLD PRETTY WELL. I REALLY LIKE DOING ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS, BECAUSE IT’S MY CHANCE TO EXPLAIN WHAT I DO AND WHY I DO IT. BUT I CAN GET A BIT A LITTLE SELF-ABSORBED. I THINK PARTLY IT’S VANITY. I MEAN, NICE PEOPLE ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT MYSELF? WHAT’S NOT TO LIKE? AND I’M TERRIBLY ASHAMED OF THAT IN A WAY. I’M HORRIFIED THAT I LIKE THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.” I LIKE THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TOO. THE CALIFORNIAN LILT WITH ITS RISING INFLECTIONS ISN’T EVERYONE’S FAVOURITE ACCENT, BUT OWENS IS SO CALM, SO MANNERED, AND SO OBVIOUSLY INTELLIGENT, HE CAN LULL YOU INTO BELIEVING ANYTHING. HIS DISARMING FRANKNESS IS ALSO REFRESHING IN AN INDUSTRY KNOWN FOR PLATITUDES AND SOUNDBITES. “AND YOU HAVE TO BE ENTERTAINERS NOW TOO. I’M SUPER LUCKY BECAUSE I’M KIND OF AN ESTABLISHMENT. I’VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I DO AND WHO I AM, SO THAT GIVES ME A CERTAIN KIND OF SENIORITY I SUPPOSE. ESPECIALLY NOW, WHEN DESIGNERS ARE SO DISPOSABLE. SOMEONE LIKE ME, I ALMOST GAIN MORE CREDIBILITY. WHO SAID THAT LINE; ‘BEING A LEGEND ISN’T DIFFICULT, YOU JUST HAVE TO LAST A LONG TIME’? NOT THAT I‘M SUBSCRIBING TO THAT, BUT HAVING DONE IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS NOW, SUCCESS IS SOMETHING YOU APPRECIATE. I DON’T ANALYSE IT TOO MUCH OTHERWISE I START GETTING TOO RESPONSIBLE. IT REALLY ONLY WORKS IF IT’S A COMPLETELY SELFISH GESTURE. THE FACT IS, I DON’T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE IN MY LIFE, PAUL. I DON’T SOCIALISE. I DON’T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS. I DON’T PURSUE A SOCIAL LIFE, SO I’M VERY DEVOTED TO WHAT I DO. IT’S THE KIND OF LIFE I’M COMFORTABLE WITH AND I DON’T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY.” IN 1994, AFTER YEARS IN THE LA WILDERNESS, AMERICAN VOGUE TOOK NOTE OF OWENS’ NASCENT TALENT AND SPONSORED HIS FIRST MAJOR CATWALK SHOW. IN PART, THE POWERS THAT BE WERE INEXORABLY DRAWN TO WHAT HAS BECOME AN ENDURING LOOK: STARK, OFF-KILTER, ANDROGYNOUS AND ASSEMBLED WITH MINIMUM FROTH AND FANCY. THE CLOTHES ALWAYS START FROM AN ARCHITECTURAL REFERENCE POINT. HIS TRADEMARK SILHOUETTE—LEAN, GEOMETRIC AND STRIDENT—STEMS FROM A PHOTO HE ONCE SAW OF A SECTION OF WALL IN BERLIN, A SYMBOL OF BRUTALIST UTOPIA THAT HE HAS SOUGHT TO CAPTURE EVER SINCE; “I AM CERTAINLY DRAWN TO BRUTALISM,” HE SAYS, WARMING TO THE SUBJECT. “IT’S ABOUT REDUCTIVISM—TAKING EVERYTHING WE’VE GOT AND SIMPLIFYING IT AND REDUCING IT. THERE IS A CONFIDENCE AND A SILENCE IN THAT KIND OF REDUCTIVISM WHICH I THINK IS VERY MODEST AND TACTFUL AND DISCREET. WITH BRUTALISM THERE’S A CERTAIN FLAMBOYANCE IN JUST THE GRANDEUR OF IT.” OWENS’ OVERARCHING AESTHETIC SEEMS TO DRAW PARALLELS WITH THIS OFTEN MALIGNED ARCHITECTURAL STYLE. A SELF-CONFESSED FAN (“ALTHOUGH I’M CERTAINLY NO EXPERT. I DON’T KNOW DATES OR THE NAMES OF BUILDINGS”), IT’S A NICHE HE FEELS NATURALLY IN LEAGUE WITH. “IT’S NOT FOR EVERYBODY, I GET THAT, BUT I CAN’T GET ENOUGH. IT’S UNSENTIMENTAL, THAT’S THE OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT IT. WHEN YOU SEE A BUILDING WITH A LOT OF DECORATION, IT CAN BE COMFORTING AND CHARMING, BUT IT’S KIND OF SENTIMENTAL. THERE’S A NOBLE DIRECTNESS TO BRUTALISM—IT’S CALCULATED AND THOUGHT THROUGH AND DELIBERATE. AND THERE’S NO FLUFF. REMEMBER THIERRY MUGLER IN THE 1980S, BEFORE HE WENT ALL ‘VA VA VOOM’, AND DID CLOTHES THAT WERE SEVERE AND MORE MILITARY? THAT’S PROBABLY THE KERNEL OF WHAT I DO NOW.” IS THAT WHERE HIS LINE COMES FROM, THAT SENSE OF PARED DOWN UTILITY? “NO, IT COMES FROM BIBLICAL EPICS, THOSE BLACK AND WHITE CECIL B DEMILLE MOVIES I USED TO WATCH WHEN I LIVED ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN MY 20S, AMONGST ALL THAT DANGER AND SLEAZE: THE ADRIAN COSTUMES, MARLENE DIETRICH, CLAUDETTE COLBERT. I’VE ALWAYS LIKED MONOCHROMATIC SCULPTURES TOO. THE WORLD IS VERY CLUTTERED, VERY BUSY, AND WHEN YOU’RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET, WHO CARES HOW ARTFULLY YOUR SHOELACES ARE TIED? IT’S ALL ABOUT HOLDING YOURSELF HIGH, BEING ON THE PEDESTAL, STANDING LIKE THE STEM OF A STRONG FLOWER. THAT IDEA, THAT POWERFUL LINE, IS JUST GREAT TO ME.” RICK OWENS DOESN’T DO SEXY, NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE ANYWAY. “THERE’S SOMETHING ATTRACTIVE ABOUT OBLITERATING ANY EFFORT AT SEXUAL ALLURE,” HE SAYS. “ON ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM THERE’S SOMETHING THAT’S PUSHING TITS AND ASSES UP, AND THEN ON THE OTHER THERE’S SOMETHING MONASTIC COVERING EVERYTHING UP. I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING SEXY ABOUT NOT NEEDING TO LOOK SO SEXY. BEING INDEPENDENT—IT’S NOT LIKE I’M FORCED TO DO ANYTHING. I GET TO PUT OUT STUFF THAT I AM GENUINELY HAPPY WITH. AND I GET TO BE FLAMBOYANT, AND PLAYFUL AND FUN AND DO RIDICULOUS THINGS THAT I LOVE TOO. WHEN I SAY RIDICULOUS, I MEAN THAT IN A VERY LOVING WAY. I LIKE FASHION THAT BORDERS ON GROTESQUE OR WRONG. I LIKE ALSO PLAYING WITH THE DEFINITION OF STANDARDS OF BEAUTY. WHAT ARE THE RULES ON WHAT’S SUPPOSED TO BE BEAUTIFUL? I LIKE DEFINING THOSE RULES. I LIKE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEAUTY.” SUBJECTIVE BEAUTY HAS PAID OFF FOR THIS UNCOMPROMISING DESIGNER, ALTHOUGH IT HASN’T MADE HIM BLINKERED. MENTIONING NO NAMES, HE TALKS ABOUT DESIGNERS WHO HAVE SOLD OUT AND LOST THEIR WAY THROUGH LICENSING, AND SEEMS ADAMANT NOT TO FOLLOW SUIT. “I COULD NEVER DO THAT,” HE SAYS, FURROWING HIS BROW, “IT JUST ISN’T ME. ALTHOUGH I WAS OFFERED A LOT OF MONEY ONCE.” HE ALSO TAKES GREAT DELIGHT IN A SPOT OF INTELLECTUAL GOSSIP ABOUT THE INDUSTRY’S LATEST UPSTARTS. “I MEAN, I SAW THE VETEMENTS SHOW, AND IT LOOKED GREAT AND EVERYTHING, BUT I’M THINKING, IS THIS BECAUSE THERE’S A WHOLE GENERATION WHO DIDN’T LIVE THROUGH MARGIELA AND NOW WANTS TO? OR IS THIS A COMBINATION OF SOME KIND OF PINTEREST MENTALITY? THERE’S LOW ARTIFICE AND HIGH ARTIFICE. KABUKI THEATRE IS HIGH ARTIFICE. JUICY COUTURE VELOUR TRACKSUITS, HOWEVER IRONIC, ARE LOW ARTIFICE.” I LIKEN THIS NEW GENERATION TO CHILDREN BREAKING INTO A SWEET SHOP AND GORGING ON THEIR SPOILS. “BUT IS THAT WRONG?” HE QUESTIONS. “IT’S EVOLUTION. EVERYTHING’S BEEN DONE BEFORE. WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW IS SIMILAR TO THE 1940S WHEN WALLIS SIMPSON WAS WEARING VERY SEVERE THINGS WITH SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD. I’M THINKING THERE’S AN AESTHETIC COMING THAT’S VERY CALCULATED, VERY SIMPLE, AND VERY HARD. AND I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.” WITH IMPECCABLE TIMING, A BOLT OF LIGHTNING PUNCTURES THE FADING SKY, A SIGN FOR OWENS THAT WE SHOULD STOP FOR DINNER. ON OUR WAY OUT, WE GLANCE AT DESIGNS FOR THE FURNITURE-AS-ART PIECES, WHICH COMPLIMENT HIS CLOTHING IN THEIR SEVERITY AND PRACTICAL FLAIR. “WE’VE ALWAYS DESIGNED AND MADE OUR OWN FURNITURE,” HE COMMENTS, “SO IT SEEMED NATURAL TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE WIDER PUBLIC. ACTUALLY, I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT, IT’S ALL MICHÈLE’S DOING. SHE’S ALL ABOUT FUR AND CONCRETE AND RAW MATERIALS. I’M WAY TOO AVERAGE IN THAT RESPECT. I LIKE TO DESIGN AND SHE LIKES TO ASSEMBLE. SHE’S THE REBELLIOUS TEENAGER AND I’M THE FUDDY DUDDY FATHER. SHE WANTS TO STAY OUT ALL NIGHT PARTYING AND I’M HAPPY TO BE AT HOME. I COULDN’T STAY UP ALL NIGHT WITHOUT DOING COKE OR SOMETHING, AND WHO DOES DRUGS ANYMORE? I WISH I COULD. I WILL IN LATER LIFE … THAT’S HOW I’M GOING OUT.” NOT ON THE BEACH, MAKE-UP MELTING DOWN YOUR FACE? “WELL, YOU KNOW, EITHER SCENARIO WOULD DO ME FINE.” WALKING TO THE RESTAURANT, THE PAIR DRAW TERRIFIED LOOKS FROM ON-COMING CYCLISTS, UNSURE WHETHER TO BRAKE OR SCREAM. FROM AN IGNORANT PERSPECTIVE, LAMY’S OCCULT SAVOIR FAIRE AND OWENS’ NOBLE STANCE—CALL IT HEAVY METAL ZEN—IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF ECCENTRIC FASHION: CARTOONISH, IRREVERENT AND CERTAINLY AHEAD OF THEIR TIME. THE WORLD IS CATCHING UP WITH OWENS, BUT HE REMAINS WAY OUT IN FRONT.

TO CELEBRATE, HE HAS GATHERED TOGETHER SOME OLD FRIENDS AND RELATIVES ON THE PATIO OF THE 7IÈME ARRONDISSEMENT HOME AND STUDIO HE SHARES WITH HIS PARTNER, MICHÈLE LAMY. THE COUPLE HAVE KNOWN MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG AND HIS WIFE LISA SINCE THE 1980S, WHEN THEY ALL LIVED IN LOS ANGELES. AT THE TIME, MICHÈLE RAN THE RESTAURANTS CAFÉ DES ARTISTES AND LES DEUX CAFÉS, ESTABLISHMENTS THAT HAVE BECOME FOLKLORIC IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN HOLLYWOOD FOR THEIR PRIVACY AND CONVIVIALITY. MEANWHILE, RICK WAS MAKING HIS FIRST MOVES INTO STARTING HIS OWN LABEL. MICHAEL IS A FILM, TELEVISION AND THEATRE DIRECTOR ACROSS MANY GENRES, DIRECTING LET IT BE FOR THE BEATLES, THE ROLLING STONES ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS AND VIDEOS FOR THE BEATLES, THE WHO AND THE ROLLING STONES FOR 15 YEARS, EPISODES OF BRIDESHEAD REVISITED AND THE OBJECT OF BEAUTY WITH JOHN MALKOVICH AND ANDIE MACDOWELL. HE PAINTS AND DRAWS AND INDEED SOME OF HIS DRAWINGS WERE CELEBRATED IN THE DEBUT ISSUE OF LUNCHEON. WE JOIN THE CONVERSATION AS MICHÈLE, RICK, MICHAEL AND LISA ARE REMEMBERING WHEN THEY FIRST MET. AMONG THE OTHERS AT THE TABLE IS MICHÈLE’S DAUGHTER SCARLETT ROUGE AND HER BOYFRIEND ANATOL LAFAYETTE, BOTH ARTISTS, JANET FISHCHGRUND, UK BRAND AMBASSADOR FOR RICK OWENS, AND FRANCES VON HOFMANNSTHAL, LUNCHEON’S EDITOR IN CHIEF: THEY ARE DOWN THE FAR END AND MOSTLY OUT OF EARSHOT, BUT JOIN IN THE CONVERSATION OCCASIONALLY AS THE EVENING FLOWS. FOOD IS PREPARED BY MICHÈLE AND RICK’S HOUSE CHEF, DIEUVEIL MALONGA, WHO HAS WORKED WITH MICHÈLE ON HER VARIOUS BARGE PROJECTS AT THE VENICE BIENNALE AND DURING FRIEZE ART FAIR IN LONDON. IT MAY BE DINNERTIME IN PARIS, BUT IT WAS LUNCHEON IN LOS ANGELES, SO THE GATHERING IS VALID FOR THIS PUBLICATION. THE FIRST COURSE, MONKFISH WITH RED PEPPER, HAS JUST BEEN SERVED… MICHÈLE LAMY: IT WAS AT THE TIME WE GOT HELD UP BY GUNS. RICK OWENS: WE GOT BROKEN INTO AT THE PLACE WE WERE STAYING AT, SOMEBODY HELD US UP BY GUNPOINT. SO THE DAY AFTER, MICHÈLE SAID, ‘WE ARE MOVING TO THE CHATEAU MARMONT’. MICHÈLE: I SAID, ‘WE CANNOT AFFORD IT, BUT WE NEED TO BE HERE’. AND WE STAYED FOR TWO YEARS. MICHAEL WAS LIVING ACROSS THE HALL. AND I REMEMBER SEEING THIS ONE (MICHÈLE POINTS TO LISA) IN THE CORRIDOR. I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME SORT OF S&amp;M THING BECAUSE IT LOOKED SO MYSTERIOUS. LISA LINDSAY-HOGG: IT WAS BEFORE ANDRÉ BALAZS HAD REFURBISHED IT. MICHÈLE: WE DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER WELL AT THE TIME BUT I REMEMBER SEEING LISA IN THE CORRIDOR. RICK: SNEAKING OUT. LISA: (LAUGHING) IS THAT HOW YOU DESCRIBE IT? MICHAEL: I THINK WE WERE IN ROOM 29 AND YOU WERE IN ROOM 28. I REMEMBER YOU HAD LOTS OF RACKS OF CLOTHES. CHARLIE PORTER: HOW MUCH DID A ROOM COST AT THE CHATEAU THEN? MICHAEL: I HAD A SUITE FOR $125 A DAY. MICHÈLE: WE WERE PAYING $3000 A MONTH. MICHAEL: NORMALLY PEOPLE I WAS WORKING FOR PAID THE BILL. IF I WASN’T WORKING, IT WAS A LITTLE LIKE HEMORRHAGING MONEY. RICK: BUT REMEMBER MY BAR BILLS? YEAH, THAT’S WHERE WE GOT INTO A HOLE. ROOM SERVICE. MICHAEL: BEFORE ANDRÉ OWNED IT, IT WAS OWNED BY A COUPLE OF ARMENIAN GUYS, ONE OF WHOM HAD A BIG ROLLS ROYCE IN THE GARAGE. I SAID TO THE MANAGER, PLEASE GIVE ME A BILL ONCE EVERY MONTH OR TWO, SO WHEN IT COMES I DON’T GET TOO MUCH OF A SHOCK. I DIDN’T GET A BILL FOR SIX MONTHS. SO I GO DOWN TO HIM AND I SAY, ‘I CAN’T PAY THIS’, AND HE SAYS, ‘WELL WHAT CAN YOU PAY?’ I SAID, ‘HALF?’ HE SAID, ‘OK, GIVE US HALF’. THAT’S WHAT IT WAS LIKE THEN. THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. IT WAS WONDERFULLY RAFFISH. MICHÈLE: HOW DID YOU TWO MEET? MICHAEL: SANNA, THE RECEPTIONIST AT THE CHATEAU, INTRODUCED LISA AND ME. SHE WAS A DANISH GIRL, WE WENT OUT FOR A WHILE. THEN A FEW YEARS LATER, I GOT REALLY BROKE AND I WAS GOING TO DO A MOVIE BASED ON THE IVANA TRUMP BOOK, AND WE WERE TRYING TO CAST A GIRL WHO LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND LIKE IVANA. SO I SAID TO SANNA, ‘WHY DON’T YOU COME AND READ FOR THIS PART?’ BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO ACT. AND SHE GOT THE PART. LISA: BUT YOU ONLY GAVE HER THE INTRODUCTION, IT WASN’T ACTUALLY NEPOTISM. MICHAEL: SHE’S THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED LISA AND ME. SO WHERE DID YOU TWO MEET? MICHÈLE: WE’VE TOLD THAT STORY A THOUSAND TIMES! RICK: MAKE LITTLE PARTS UP! JUICE IT UP A BIT! MICHÈLE: I HAD TO INTERVIEW HIM. FOR A JOB. I HAD THIS CLOTHING COMPANY, DOING SOME MICHÈLE LAMY STUFF. IF YOU WANT THE LONG VERSION, THERE WAS ANOTHER RICK, AND I SAID, YOU SHOULD START WORKING WITH ME. HE SAID HE’D LIKE TO DO THAT BUT HE DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO MAKE PATTERNS BUT THAT HE KNEW A GREAT PATTERN MAKER. (RICK STARTS SMILING) MICHAEL: RICK, YOU THEN WERE 25, 26? RICK: 25. MICHÈLE: NOT EVEN. WHEN WE STARTED TO BE TOGETHER YOU WERE 25. MICHAEL: SO YOU WENT FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH HER? RICK: I WENT FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH HER, BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY… MICHÈLE: YEAH THAT’S HIS VERSION, BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY (MICHÈLE PAUSES, EVERYONE LAUGHS). THAT OTHER RICK WANTED TO BE WITH THIS RICK. SO THEN WE HAD RICK WORKING THERE, THE OTHER RICK TOO, GOOD RICK, BAD RICK, AND SO THERE WERE ALL THESE STORIES OF THE TWO RICKS, AND HE (POINTING AT RICK) MAKES THE STORY TO SAY THAT HE NEVER TALKED TO ME. THAT WAS SO WRONG. RICK: NO I’M NOT SAYING I DIDN’T TALK TO YOU, I’M JUST SAYING I NEVER REALLY GOT TO KNOW YOU UNTIL AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS. MICHÈLE: AFTER YOU KILLED THE OTHER RICK. RICK: AFTER I GOT RID OF THE OTHER RICK. AFTER I ELIMINATED THE OTHER RICK. MICHÈLE: VOILÀ! MICHAEL: WHEN DID YOU START TO GO OUT? RICK: I THINK OUR FIRST DATE WAS HALLOWEEN. WE WENT DANCING IN WATER THE BUSH [A CLUB NIGHT AT THE STARDUST BALLROOM]. WASN’T THAT THE FIRST TIME WE WENT SOMEWHERE BY OURSELVES? MICHÈLE: I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR THAT STARN TWINS SHOW. RICK: NO BECAUSE WE WERE ALREADY LIVING TOGETHER THEN. BECAUSE WE HAD PORK WITH US AND PORK HAD CRASHED AT THE HOUSE THAT DAY… MICHAEL: PORK? RICK: I REMEMBER THAT I WAS GOING TO ORDER MORE VODKA FROM… WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT PLACE I USED TO ORDER LIQUOR FROM? THE LIQUOR LOCKER?... YOU TOLD ME TO CANCEL THE ORDER BECAUSE WE WERE GOING TO THE STARN TWINS SHOW, WE GOT TO THE BLACK TRUCK AND WE ALL WENT TO THE STARN TWINS AND WE HAD PORK WITH US. HIS NAME WAS PORK. MICHÈLE: THEN WE GOT STOPPED BY THE POLICE IN THE LA RIVER. RICK: OH YEAH. BECAUSE I HAD THIS BLACK T-TYPE CAMARO THAT I’D ALWAYS WANTED SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER. MICHÈLE: THAT I HAD TO SIGN FOR (SHE LAUGHS). RICK: THERE’S A SECRET WAY TO GET INTO THE LA RIVER, BY RAMP. WE WERE DRIVING ROUND IN THE LA RIVER DRINKING BEER BECAUSE IT WAS LATE AND WE COULDN’T GET ANYTHING ELSE. WE GOT STOPPED BY THE POLICE AND I JUST REMEMBER THE FEATHERS YOU WERE WEARING ON YOUR HEAD. LISA: NO WONDER THE POLICE STOPPED YOU. MICHÈLE: THEY TOLD US TO GET AWAY. RICK: THEY SAID IT WAS DANGEROUS, GANG WARS AND STUFF. THEY FOUND EMPTY BOTTLES OF VODKA UNDER MY SEAT. MICHÈLE: BUT THEY COULDN’T CARE LESS. RICK: THEY LET US GO. MICHAEL: WHEN DID YOU STOP DRINKING? RICK: RIGHT BEFORE 40. THAT’S WHEN I STOPPED. IT TOOK ME ABOUT THREE TIMES. I WAS A REALLY BAD DRINKER. I WAS A BINGE DRINKER AND I WOULD JUST NOT STOP UNTIL I PASSED OUT AND WHEN I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS I WOULD JUST KEEP GOING. I WAS VERY MESSY ABOUT IT, AND SO I FINALLY JUST STOPPED BECAUSE MY HEALTH WAS JUST TOO JEOPARDISED. IT WAS REALLY SCARY. I WAS REALLY SCARED. SO I JUST HAD TO STOP. BUT IT WAS FINE. I NEVER REALLY DID AA OR ANYTHING. I DON’T EVEN CRAVE IT. IT’S KIND OF LIKE A BAD GIRLFRIEND. IT’S LIKE SOMEONE I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH, A LONG TIME AGO BUT WE COULD NEVER, EVER LIVE TOGETHER AGAIN. MICHAEL: (MICHAEL GETS SCARLETT’S ATTENTION). SCARLETT, WE’VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING YOU THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE. WHEN DID YOU LIVE WITH OUR DARLING MICHÈLE? SCARLETT: FROM ZERO TO NINE, THEN A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE IN BETWEEN. I SPENT THE SUMMER AND EVERY HOLIDAYS IN LA. MICHAEL: WHERE DID YOU GO AND LIVE AGED NINE? SCARLETT: LYON. I WAS LIVING WITH MICHÈLE’S SISTER, AUNT BETTY. THEN I LEFT AND I WENT AT 16 TO SANTA BARBARA IN CALIFORNIA WHERE I WAS LIVING WITH MY FATHER. HE HAD A GRAVEYARD SHIFT JOB EDITING, SO HE WASN’T HOME AT NIGHT. I COULD DO WHAT THE F CK I WANTED. CHARLIE: MICHAEL, CAN YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST MET MICHÈLE? MICHAEL: I MET MICHÈLE AT CAFÉ DES ARTISTES. IT WAS BEFORE I MET LISA, SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN 1986, 87, 88. RICK: SO YOU USED TO GO TO THE CAFÉ WITH NONA SUMMERS [LONG TIME CONTRIBUTING EDITOR TO BRITISH VOGUE]? MICHAEL: CAFÉ DES ARTISTES WAS WITH NONA, I THINK. LISA: BUT I WENT THERE TOO, BEFORE I MET YOU. MICHAEL: YOU WENT THERE SEPARATELY. I REMEMBER GOING TO CAFÉ DES ARTISTES WITH SUSAN FORRISTAL, DAMIEN HARRIS, DIRECTOR AND THE BROTHER OF JARED, THE ACTOR. AND WHO’S THE GIRL WHO USED TO GO OUT WITH JULIAN SCHNABEL? THAT WAS I THINK THE LAST TIME I WENT TO CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, WHICH I THINK WAS 1990? LISA: WE WENT THERE TOGETHER. I REMEMBER GOING THERE WITH YOU. MICHAEL: AND MICHÈLE WAS THERE. SO THAT WOULD BE 1990.WHEN DID YOU LEAVE CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, MICHÈLE? MICHÈLE: I HATE TO COUNT. I NEVER REMEMBER THE YEARS. LISA: BUT WHEN YOU LEFT CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, DIDN’T IT CONTINUE AFTER? MICHAEL: IT DID. WE WENT THERE AND IT WAS TERRIBLE. CHARLIE: WHERE WAS CAFÉ DES ARTISTES? MICHÈLE: IT WAS ON MCCADDEN [A COUPLE OF BLOCKS SOUTH OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD]. AT THAT TIME HOLLYWOOD WAS REALLY DESPERATE, WITH DRUG DEALERS, CRYSTAL METH, EVERYTHING. BUT WE HAD A FANTASTIC TIME THERE, THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING AMAZING. THEN, WHEN I WANTED TO MOVE ONE BLOCK UP THE STREET TO LAS PALMAS [THE LOCATION OF LES DEUX CAFÉS], I HAD TO FIGHT THE CITY. THEY DIDN’T WANT TO GIVE ANOTHER LIQUOR LICENCE. EVENTUALLY I GOT A MEDAL FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOR THE REGENERATION OF HOLLYWOOD. LISA: YOU DID. MICHAEL: AND RICK, THAT WAS YOUR ATELIER ACROSS THE STREET? RICK: WE LIVED THERE. WE MOVED IN THERE WHILE YOU WERE DOING CONSTRUCTION AT LES DEUX CAFÉS. HOW DID IT WORK? MICHÈLE: YOU MOVED IN BEFORE. YOU FOUND THE STUDIO, WE WERE STILL AT THE CAFÉ, WE MOVED. RICK: AND THEN YOU STARTED CONSTRUCTION. I REMEMBER A FANTASTIC PICTURE OF YOU WALKING TOWARDS THE CURTAINS AT THE FRONT, ON THE WAY TO GO ACROSS THE STREET TO WORK ON THE CONSTRUCTION. YOU’RE WEARING MARGIELA SHOES AND ONE OF MY BIAS SKIRTS. THE SILHOUETTE IS VERY FLATTERING ON YOUR SHAPE. I HAVE TO FIND IT. MICHAEL: BUT THE PREMISES AT LES DEUX, DIDN’T YOU MOVE A HOUSE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER? BECAUSE IT ENDED UP IN THE BACK OF A PARKING LOT. MICHÈLE: I WAS AT CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, AND THESE PEOPLE HAD AN EMPTY HUGE PARKING LOT. THEY SAID, ‘WHY DON’T YOU MOVE?’ RICK: BECAUSE THOSE GUYS USED TO GO TO CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, RIGHT? THEY WERE RASCALS. CHARLIE: AT WHAT POINT DID YOU START MAKING YOUR OWN CLOTHES? RICK: AT THE CHATEAU. NO, THAT’S NOT TRUE. I WAS MAKING CLOTHES IN THE APARTMENT THAT WE GOT HELD UP IN. I WAS DOING STUFF FOR COSTUMES, THEN I DID THE FIRST REAL COLLECTION OF CLOTHES THAT I SOLD IN THE CHATEAU. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT UNTIL RECENTLY. WE LIVED ABOVE THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE CHATEAU BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP. IT’S NOT WHAT IT IS NOW. IT WAS A DUMP. MICHÈLE: WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ALL THESE STORIES? MICHAEL: I’M ALWAYS INTERESTED IN HISTORY. CHARLIE: MICHÈLE, IT TOOK YOU EIGHT MONTHS AFTER YOU LEFT CAFÉ DES ARTISTES TO OPEN LES DEUX CAFÉ? MICHÈLE: I HAD CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS. MICHAEL: IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE AN LA PARKING LOT, COMPLETELY UNGLAMOROUS. AND THEN YOU’D GO THROUGH A LITTLE DOOR IN THE SIDE AND THERE WAS JUST A GUY SITTING THERE WITH A CLIPBOARD. AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU CAME INTO THIS PARADISE WITH A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN, I THINK THERE WASN’T A POND IN THE MIDDLE BUT STONE THINGS FILLED WITH WATER AND FLOWERS, THEN YOU’D GO INTO A DINNER ROOM… LISA: AND THERE WAS MICHÈLE! MICHÈLE: THE KITCHEN WAS IN ANOTHER BUILDING. MICHAEL: AND EVERYBODY HAD TO WALK ACROSS THE STREET WITH THE FOOD? RICK: THERE WASN’T A LOT OF TRAFFIC. MICHÈLE: THE SIDE STREET WAS VERY SMALL. WHEN YOU ARE ON THE RIVIERA, RESTAURANTS ARE BY THE SEA, AND KITCHENS ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE. FOR ME IT WAS NORMAL. RICK: EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE RIVIERA. MICHÈLE: IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THE RIVIERA. I HAD A LOT OF FUN, EVEN IF IT WAS HARD TO GET ALL THOSE CITY PERMITS. I ASKED FOR DANCING, THEY WERE IMAGINING I WANTED POLE DANCERS. IT WAS HOLLYWOOD: NOBODY COULD IMAGINE ANYTHING ELSE. AT A POINT, THERE WAS OPPOSITION HERE AND THERE. THEN I DECIDED WE WERE GOING WITH A CHEF WHO GAVE COOKING CLASS TO THE SCHOOL NEXT DOOR. RICK: OH THAT’S WHAT YOU TOLD THEM – NOW I REMEMBER. YOU WERE GOING TO DO CIVIC SERVICE. MICHÈLE: I HEARD THE MOST FUNNY THING, NOT FROM THE KIDS BUT FROM THE TEACHER. I SAID WE WERE GOING TO SERVE A SIMPLE SALAD AND SAUCE AND THE TEACHER SAID, ‘I DIDN’T KNOW YOU COULD MAKE YOUR OWN SAUCE’. SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS JUST A TAP SOMEWHERE IN A FACTORY. CHARLIE: WHAT WAS THE FOOD LIKE? MICHÈLE: WE DEVELOPED A STORY WITH THE FARMERS. CAFÉ DES ARTISTES HAD A REALLY SMALL KITCHEN, SO THERE WAS NOT MUCH WE COULD DO. THEN I MET THIS BEAUTIFUL CHEF DAVID WYNNS, AND HE TURNED ME ON TO MFK FISCHER. MICHAEL: MFK FISHER’S BOOKS? OH SHE’S GREAT. RICK: HE TURNED US ALL ON TO HER. MICHAEL: MFK FISCHER WAS A FABULOUSLY SENSUOUS WRITER ABOUT FOOD, ENTWINING MENUS WITH HER PERSONAL LIFE. RICK: SHE’S LIKE A COLETTE FOR FOOD. MICHÈLE: SO THAT’S HOW WE STARTED TO DEVELOP IT. I HAVE A PAST ON MY MOTHER’S SIDE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS. THEY HAD THEIR OWN FARMS, AND ALL THESE RULES LIKE YOU CANNOT EAT PEAS AFTER THE 14TH OF JULY BECAUSE THEY’RE ONLY TENDER TILL THE 14TH.AT THE TIME THERE WERE A LOT OF CLEVER PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO WERE STARTING TO BE FARMERS, SO WE WENT OVERBOARD. YOU COULDN’T HAVE RED TOMATOES BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT CHIC ENOUGH. WE WANTED HEIRLOOM TOMATOES THAT WERE PURPLE AND YELLOW. THE FARMERS THOUGHT IT WAS SO MUCH FUN AT LES DEUX, THEY STARTED COMING AT 11 AT NIGHT, BECAUSE ANYWAY THE MARKET WAS AT 5AM. EVERYONE CAME. WE HAD ACTORS, PERFORMERS, THEN WE HAD DIRECTORS, AND THE MOVIE SCENE. THEY COULD MAKE THEIR ENTRANCE ON A PRIVATE PARKING LOT, SO THERE WERE NO PAPARAZZI. AND INSIDE THERE WERE NO PHOTOS. THERE WERE NO PHONES THEN, WE HAD THOSE BIG CELL PHONES. SO THERE ARE VERY FEW PICTURES [AND HERE THE CONVERSATION TURNS TO GOSSIP, INCLUDING MUCH TALK OF FAKE CLITORAL PIERCINGS]. MICHAEL: THE FUNNY THING ABOUT LES DEUX WAS THAT IT NEVER SEEMED TO BE QUITE FINISHED. IT ALWAYS WAS LIKE A WORK IN PROGRESS, MORPHING, CHANGING, BEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND MICHÈLE WAS THERE EVERY NIGHT. IT WASN’T SET OR FIXED IN SOME MOULD. MICHÈLE: THAT WAS PART OF THE THEATRE. PEOPLE WERE VERY CREATIVE IN HOLLYWOOD, EVEN IF THEY WERE MAKING MOVIES YOU DIDN’T LIKE. THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO PUT SO MUCH IMPORTANCE ON TELLING A STORY. IT WAS FUN FOR ME TO HEAR ALL THESE DIFFERENT STORIES FROM THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. IT WAS LIKE I HAD THIS WHOLE WORLD AROUND ME. AND PEOPLE HAD A FEELING FOR LES DEUX. THEY WOULD COME TO ME AND SAY, ‘I’M GOING ON LOCATION, SO YOU’RE NOT GOING TO SEE ME FOR THREE MONTHS. IT’S NOT BECAUSE I’M NOT COMING TO LES DEUX, IT’S BECAUSE I’M NOT HERE’. I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY COOL. IT WAS LIKE WE WERE IN A STORY BUT WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS. MICHAEL: THE THING ABOUT MICHÈLE IS THAT WHEREVER SHE IS, PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD TIME. CHARLIE: HOW OFTEN DID YOU GO TO LES DEUX? LISA: PRETTY OFTEN. A COUPLE OF TIMES A MONTH. MICHAEL: IT WAS THE SENSE OF THE PLACE, THE VIBE THAT EVERYONE’S GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT. THERE JUST WAS A SENSE THAT THIS WAS A NICE PLACE TO BE WITH PEOPLE WE MIGHT KNOW. MICHÈLE: WE REALLY HAD A LOT OF FUN THERE. LISA: BUT ALSO BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS THERE, MICHÈLE. MICHÈLE: THERE WERE ALL THESE STORIES. ONE TIME I FOUND THIS GUY WHO DID AN ACT WITH A CHAINSAW. THE ALARM CAME ON BUT WE DIDN’T HEAR IT BECAUSE WE HAD THE CHAINSAW, THE MUSIC. THE FIREMEN ARRIVED. I SAID ‘I’M SO SORRY’. THEY SAID, ‘IT’S FRIDAY NIGHT, WHERE ELSE DO YOU THINK WE WANT TO BE?’. MICHAEL: WHAT MADE YOU MOVE TO PARIS? RICK: I STARTED TO MANUFACTURE IN ITALY, SO I HAD TO COME HERE A LOT ANYWAY. IT WAS AN EXCITING NEW ADVENTURE. MICHÈLE: AND HE DIDN’T WANT TO SHOW IN NEW YORK. RICK: THERE WAS ALSO REVILLON [THE FUR HOUSE OF WHICH RICK WAS CREATIVE DIRECTOR]. I DIDN’T REALISE HOW WORKING FOR A FRENCH HOUSE VALIDATED YOU AS A DESIGNER. PEOPLE TALK TO YOU DIFFERENTLY AND THAT WAS AN ADDED PLUS. MICHAEL: AND YOU CONTINUE TO DO YOUR WORK BECAUSE YOU ENJOY IT. RICK: EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING MYSELF. I HAVE TO STOP TRYING TO THINK RESPONSIBLY AND JUST HAVE FUN. FRANCES VON HOFMANNSTHAL: I CAN’T BELIEVE WE’RE ALL HAVING DINNER HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE YOUR SHOW TODAY WAS JUST SO INCREDIBLE AND SUCH A MASSIVE MOMENT. I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU’RE STANDING! RICK: A FRIEND DID ONCE SAY IT’S LIKE YOU’RE HAVING A WEDDING FOUR TIMES A YEAR. AND IT IS. MICHAEL: TODAY WAS EXTRAORDINARY. I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO. [RICK’S SHOW HAD BEEN A STUDY IN DRAPING, AND EXPANSIVENESS OF CLOTH. TOPS CAME DRAPED OVER THE SHOULDERS AS IF A WORK OF COUTURE, BEFORE FALLING DOWN LIKE THE KNOTTED ARMS OF A SWEATSHIRT; THE FABRIC OF OVERSIZED PANTS ROSE UP OVER AND ABOVE THE WAIST; LITTLE LEATHER JACKETS WERE CROPPED AT THE WAIST, WHILE TUXEDOS CAME EITHER CROPPED WITH LONG SLEEVES OR WITH A LONG-EXTENDED BODY. THAT&#39;S JUST A SNAPSHOT OF IT ALL – THERE WAS SO MUCH ELSE]. THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT, BECAUSE OF MY AGE AND BODY TYPE, I PROBABLY WOULDN’T… LISA: ACTUALLY YOU WOULD WEAR THEM AND YOU’D LOOK REALLY GOOD IN THEM. MICHAEL: I LOVE THE LITTLE ZIP-UP JACKETS. RICK: ALL OF THAT STUFF IS EXAGGERATED VERSIONS. IT’S THE MOST EXTREME VERSION OF WHAT WE HAVE. I TOTALLY SEE YOU IN SOME OF THOSE SILK GAZAR PANTS AND A ZIP-FRONT JACKET. LISA: HE WEARS A SKIRT AT HOME A LOT. MICHAEL: I WEAR A SARONG AT HOME IN LA SOME-TIMES BECAUSE IT’S HOT. BUT THERE WAS ONE LOOK NEAR THE END. IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE WAS DOWN ON HIS LUCK A BIT, HE HAD DARK FABRIC AROUND HIS BODY, AND I THOUGHT, HE IS EVERYMAN. NOW YOU’RE SAYING, WHAT THE F CK IS HE TALKING ABOUT?! BUT IF WE GO INTO THE FUTURE, WILL YOU BE WEARING ANDERSON &amp; SHEPHERD SUITS, OR WILL YOU BE WEARING SOMETHING THAT COVERS YOUR BODY AND WHICH HAS A REMEMBRANCE OF THE PAST, OF WHAT CLOTHES WERE? I REALLY FELT THAT. [THE CONVERSATION GOES OFF THE RECORD AS THE WORK OF OTHER DESIGNERS IS DISCUSSED. WE RETURN JUST AS SOMEONE HAS ASKED RICK IF TODAY’S COLLECTION HAD BEEN ABOUT DECONSTRUCTION]. RICK: THEY WERE VERY COLLAPSING. I DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. THEY’RE NOT THAT DECONSTRUCTED, BECAUSE DECONSTRUCTED WOULD MEAN IT WOULD BE ABOUT ANALYSING THE INSIDES. IT MEANS THAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT CONSTRUCTION. IT WASN’T TALKING ABOUT CONSTRUCTION ITSELF. IT’S ALL VERY CALCULATED. IT’S NOT CHANCE, THAT’S FOR SURE. BUT IT’S LIKE YOUR DRAWINGS, MICHAEL, YOU WANT IT TO LOOK EFFORTLESS AND BREEZY. MICHAEL: I THOUGHT IT WAS THRILLING. WHEN YOU’RE WORKING ON THE COLLECTION, DO YOU THINK, I WANT TO THRILL PEOPLE, OR DO YOU THINK I JUST WANT TO DO WHAT WILL INTEREST ME IN TERMS OF SHAPE, FABRIC AND VOLUME? RICK: I’M JUST THINKING THIS HAS TO MAKE SENSE, AND I HAVE TO LIKE IT AND IT HAS TO FEEL LIKE IT&#39;S THE RIGHT THING TO SAY. I DON’T THINK ABOUT THE RESPONSE MUCH, I HONESTLY DON’T. A DAY LIKE TODAY, I’M KIND OF OVER IT. ALL THE EMOTION I FELT ABOUT THE IDEAS, I ALREADY PEAKED LIKE A MONTH AGO BECAUSE I WAS WORKING ON IT THEN. MICHAEL: AND YOU DON’T WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE AGAIN. RICK: IT’S NOT THAT, I STILL LIKE IT, I’M STILL HAPPY WITH IT. BUT THAT SPARK, THAT FEELING THAT THIS IS RIGHT AND IT’S COMING TOGETHER, I DID THAT BY MYSELF. AND THAT WAS A MONTH AGO. NOW I PRESENT IT AND I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE IT, BUT I CAN’T GET AS EXCITED, I CAN’T JOIN YOU IN THE PEAK BECAUSE I ALREADY PEAKED, WHICH IS A FUNNY LITTLE THING. MICHAEL: DO YOU DRAPE ON MANNEQUINS OR ON PEOPLE? RICK: ON MANNEQUINS FIRST AND THEN PEOPLE. I CAN’T DRAPE FAST ENOUGH. IT MAKES ME NERVOUS, HAVING A MODEL STANDING THERE WAITING FOR ME TO DO STUFF. MICHAEL: DO YOU DRAW FIRST? RICK: NOT REALLY. I TAKE PICTURES OF TOILES AND THEN I CUT THEM UP TO SEE DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS. I HAVE SOME BASIC SHAPES FROM WHICH I MAKE TOILES. I SAY THAT I NEED 7504 AND 7506 AND THEY QUICKLY MAKE A LITTLE TOILE OUT OF MUSLIN AND THEN I PLAY WITH THAT ON THE MANNEQUIN. CHARLIE: MICHÈLE, CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR BARGE PROJECTS? MICHÈLE: SO I FOUND THIS FANTASTIC 24-YEAR-OLD FROM CONGO, DIEUVEIL MALONGA. WHEN HE WAS 14 HIS PARENTS WERE KILLED DURING THE WAR. A GERMAN PASTOR TOOK HIM IN AND PUT HIM IN A COOKING SCHOOL IN GERMANY BUT FROM THERE HE DEVELOPED HIS OWN THING AND NOW HE COOKS WITH US. WE DID THE FIRST BARGE AT THE VENICE BIENNALE. THERE IS FOOD, A RECORDING STUDIO. IT&#39;S THE CONCEPT HAT YOU CAN BUILD THINGS. IT TOOK A LOT OF THINKING, YOU CAN PUT IT UP IN ON DAY, YOU CAN TAKE IT DOWN IN HALF A DAY. RICK: IT REALLY IS A BARGE. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, MICHAEL. WHEN YOU’RE IN THE BARGE, MICHÈLE HAD BUILT THESE WALLS AROUND IT, THERE WAS A PLANTER THING IN THE MIDDLE, IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE BEING IN LES DEUX. MICHAEL: WELL I WILL BE IN VENICE ANYTIME ANYONE SAYS. SOME OF BRIDESHEAD REVISITED WAS SHOT IN VENICE. RICK: YOU KNOW I’VE BEEN WATCHING THAT AGAIN RECENTLY, I WATCH IT WITH THE SOUND OFF WHEN I’M TAKING A SHOWER, WITH NINA SIMONE PLAYING. BUT MICHÈLE, IT’S IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT IT WAS IN MOTION, OR IN TRANSITION. MICHÈLE: AND I WANT TO BE SURPRISED BY WHAT IS COMING. RICK: YOU RESIST RESOLUTION. YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT SUSPENSE I THINK. MICHÈLE: BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A RESOLUTION. MICHAEL: DO YOU LIKE THE RESOLUTION OR DO YOU NEVER WANT THINGS TO BE FINISHED? MICHÈLE: WHEN I AM IN ONE BARGE, I’M ALREADY IN THE NEXT ONE. I DON’T WANT THE TIME TO STOP, AND I KNOW IT CAN NEVER BE THE SAME, SO THEN YOU TRY AND INVENT NEW THINGS. [IT IS GETTING LATE. LISA AND MICHAEL HAVE TO PACK BEFORE THEIR RETURN TO THE US. TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE NEW AND HOPEFUL SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO END. EVERYONE RAISES THEIR GLASSES, TO THE CHEF, TO RICK, TO MICHÈLE]. ALL: THANK YOU SO MUCH! BRAVO!

IF I HAD CHILDREN I WOULD TAKE ALL THIS MORE SERIOUSLY, BUT I ENDED UP BEING A SELFISH CREATOR. I&#39;M KIND OF LIVING IN MY OWN LITTLE SANDBOX,&quot; HE ADMITS, LOOKING OUT ON THE ADRIATIC SEA FROM A SOFA IN HIS VENICE CONDO. &quot;BUT ON THIS ONE, WE CAN&#39;T LET 1939 HAPPEN AGAIN,&quot; HE SHRUGS. OWENS HAS BEEN IN A REFLECTIVE MOOD THIS SUMMER, IN SELF-IMPOSED EXILE FROM HIS PARISIAN HEADQUARTERS IN HIS NEW HOME ON THE LIDO, O SOLO MIO BAR THE EMPLOYEES, WHO TAKE TURNS STAYING IN THE GUEST APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS WHILE OWENS DESIGNS HIS WOMEN&#39;S COLLECTION. IT&#39;S NOT FAR FROM THE ABANDONED GRAND HOTEL DES BAINS WHERE THOMAS MANN&#39;S BROODING PROTAGONIST FIRST DISEMBARKED A BOAT IN DEATH IN VENICE CIRCA 1912. IMMORTALIZED BY DIRK BOGARDE ON LUCHINO VISCONTI&#39;S SILVER SCREEN HALF A CENTURY LATER, HIS GHOST STILL HAUNTS THE VENETIAN SANDBAR. &quot;MORTALITY IS ALWAYS ON THE SURFACE WITH ME. I&#39;VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT THIS MONTH BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE DEATH IN VENICE CONNECTION, BUT ALSO, EVERYTHING I&#39;VE BEEN READING RECENTLY IS BIOGRAPHIES OF DEAD LITERARY QUEENS.&quot; THEY INCLUDE: LORD BERNERS, RONALD FIRBANK, JAMES LORD, DENTON WELCH, AND OF COURSE BOGARDE. &quot;IT MUST BE THIS WHOLE VENICE THING. BUT ALSO THE WHOLE POLITICAL CLIMATE NOW; ALL THIS DIVISIVENESS; THE MALE EGO IN AMERICAN POLITICS.&quot; JUST BACK FROM HIS DAILY BEACH ROUNDS, A BAREFOOT RICK OWENS IS SAUNTERING AROUND HIS HOLIDAY ABODE, CLAD IN SOMETHING BLACK AND DRAPEY (HIS TAKE ON SHORTS AND A T-SHIRT), HIS TANNED SKIN SIZZLING ON HIS RIPPED BODY. THERE&#39;S A SALT-WATERED TOUSLE TO HIS LONG, UNDERCUT RAVEN HAIR. THE TOP FLOORS OF ONE OF THE BISCOTTI-BEIGE APARTMENT BLOCKS FROM THE 60S THAT LINE THE UNASSUMING EAST SIDE OF THE ISLAND, HIS REFUGE IS A FAR CRY FROM THE CANDY-COLORED PALAZZI AND BAROQUE BEACH HOTELS YOU&#39;D PICTURE. &quot;IT&#39;S SO NON-FABULOUS, EVEN THOUGH IT&#39;S FABULOUS,&quot; HE SAYS AND BREAKS OPEN THE DOORS TO A CUPBOARD THAT TRANSFORMS INTO A KITCHEN. THE SAME ROOM HOUSES HIS GYM EQUIPMENT, A COMPACT CONCEPT THAT RUNS THROUGH THE CONDO HE&#39;S BEEN RICK-IFYING SINCE HE BOUGHT IT LAST SUMMER. &quot;IT LOOKED VERY WORLD OF INTERIORS,&quot; HE RECALLS, DESCRIBING THE TURQUOISE AND ORANGE TILES AND COLOR-BLOCKED WALLS HE&#39;S NOW REFINED TO WHITE VENETIAN WAXED PLASTER (MARMORINO, HE SAYS, IS FAKE), GREY STONE FLOORS, AND SPRAWLING CUSTOM-MADE RICK OWENS SOFAS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A BRUTALIST BEACH HOUSE. DOWN THE ROAD IS THE PALAZZO DEL CINEMA, WHICH HOSTS THE VENICE FILM FESTIVAL. &quot;IT&#39;S THIS MUSSOLINI MARBLE BUILDING WITH COLUMNS AND IT WAS ALWAYS MY DREAM TO LIVE THERE. SO I THOUGHT, THIS NEEDS TO BE MUSSOLINI&#39;S BATHROOM.&quot; UNLIKE THE WRITER IN DEATH IN VENICE, OWENS HASN&#39;T COME TO THE LIDO TO BEAT A CREATIVE BLOCK. LIKE HIM, THOUGH, HE IS HERE BECAUSE SOMETHING ON HIS HORIZON HAS CHANGED. AFTER SEASONS OF CAMP MEGA SHOWS FEATURING ACROBATS SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING, SORORITY STEP DANCERS AND EUROVISION REJECT ROCKERS WINNY PUHH, TWO YEARS AGO — AROUND THE TIME HE&#39;D TURNED 50 — OWENS DECIDED TO PULL BACK. IN THE SEASONS THAT FOLLOWED, HIS COLLECTIONS BECAME LESS SEVERE AND MORE ROMANTIC, MORE COUTURE. THE SHOWS TURNED INTO HUMANITARIAN OBSERVATIONS, FROM THE PROVOCATIVE SUCH AS THE GLORY-HOLED MAN-DRESSES REVEALING BOYS&#39; GENITALS, TO THE COMPASSIONATE IN WOMEN CARRYING OTHER WOMEN ON THEIR BACKS. &quot;I THOUGHT, I CAN MAKE IT MORE INTENSE BY DISTILLING ALL OF IT INTO A SMALLER VISIBLE GESTURE.&quot; THE ZENITH OF HIS BELLE ÉPOQUE, OWENS DRAPED HIS ENTIRE FALL/WINTER 16 WOMEN&#39;S COLLECTION HIMSELF, ISOLATED IN HIS STUDIO RECONNECTING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF HIS CRAFT AND CREATING A SIGNATURE THAT COULD NEVER BE REPRODUCED BY ANYONE ELSE. HE ICED HIS DREAMY DRAPERY WITH GIANT VEIL-LIKE HAIRBALLS, EVOKING A SOFTNESS HE RELATED TO &quot;AN EVAPORATION INTO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN US.&quot; BACKSTAGE HE MUSED, &quot;EVERYTHING HAS A SHELF LIFE. HOW DO WE FACE THAT IN A GRACEFUL, POSITIVE WAY? I&#39;M NOT NEW AGE OR BUDDHIST, I&#39;M JUST TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONS THAT WE CAN ALL RELATE TO WHEN CHANGE THREATENS US.&quot; AS PART OF HIS OWN EVOLUTION, LAST YEAR OWENS BOUGHT THE FACTORY IN CONCORDIA NOT FAR FROM VENICE, WHICH HE&#39;S WORKED WITH FOR 12 YEARS, AS WELL AS AN APARTMENT CLOSE TO IT TO REPLACE THE &quot;SERIAL KILLER ON THE RUN&quot; PETROL STATION MOTEL ROOM HE&#39;D ALWAYS STAYED IN. HE WAS REASSESSING HIS BUSINESS AND HIMSELF, THINKING ABOUT HIS LEGACY AND TRYING TO PATCH TOGETHER WHAT WAS LEFT OF 20 YEARS&#39; WORTH OF ARCHIVES — IN SHAMBLES. &quot;I GOT MAD. I SAID, NONE OF YOU THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH THAT WE MIGHT NEED THIS STUFF?&quot; HE LAUGHS. &quot;FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE WE&#39;RE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT NOW AND I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. IF THE PAST WAS ABOUT SURVIVAL THE FUTURE NEEDS TO BE ABOUT REFINING WHAT WE&#39;VE DONE. I NEED TO LIVE A CERTAIN WAY NOW.&quot; BUYING THIS VENETIAN GETAWAY LAST YEAR WAS PART OF THAT PROCESS. A VISION OF HEALTH THANKS TO A GRUELING FITNESS REGIME (AND NOT DRINKING FOR 25 YEARS), OWENS IS WORLDS APART FROM BOGARDE&#39;S BEREFT AND AILING COMPOSER IN DEATH IN VENICE, WHO CONTRACTS CHOLERA AND SAILS INTO SAN MARCO WHERE A BARBER DYES HIS HAIR AND COVERS HIM IN MAKE-UP LIKE THE LIVING DEAD. BUT THE PARALLEL BETWEEN HIS AND OWENS&#39; STORYLINES REMAINS: THE MIDDLE-AGED CREATORS STRANDED ON THE LIDO IN DEEP REFLECTION. DEALING WITH MASCULINE TEMPERAMENT AND THE CHANGES WE GO THROUGH WITH AGE, THE 53-YEAR-OLD OWENS HAS WONDERED IF HIS LAST TWO MEN&#39;S COLLECTIONS DIDN&#39;T REPRESENT A TYPE OF MIDLIFE CRISIS ON HIS PART. &quot;BECAUSE DECLINE IS INEVITABLE,&quot; HE POINTS OUT. &quot;AND THE FEAR OF DEATH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOTIVATIONS TO DO SOMETHING WHILE WE&#39;RE HERE.&quot; IF A BOY&#39;S FIRST COMING-OF-AGE IS ROOTED IN THE TEENAGE DOOM, WHICH VERY MUCH FED INTO OWENS&#39; BRAND FROM ITS BIRTH IN 1994 ONWARDS, THE DEFINITE COMING-OF-AGE IS DEFINED BY THE LOSS OF A PARENT. LAST YEAR, HIS FATHER DIED AT 95, SUBCONSCIOUSLY PROMPTING OWENS TO READ THOSE BIOGRAPHIES OF MEN &quot;TRYING TO NEGOTIATE THEIR ENDINGS.&quot; HE TALKS ABOUT BOGARDE AND HIS UNOFFICIAL MALE LOVER, WHO GOT ALZHEIMER&#39;S AND ASKED BOGARDE TO EUTHANIZE HIM WITH CYANIDE CAPSULES SAVED FROM THE WAR WHEN THE TIME CAME — A SUICIDE PACT DISRUPTED BY BOGARDE&#39;S STROKE. &quot;THAT&#39;S THE WAY IT WAS WITH MY DAD, TOO,&quot; OWENS SAYS, NEVER INTERRUPTING HIS CALM CALIFORNIAN FLOW. &quot;HE WAS GETTING STUFF THROUGH THE INTERNET TO PREPARE. HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO USE THEM EITHER. HE ENDED UP IN A WHEELCHAIR WITH NURSES AND COULDN&#39;T GET TO HIS PILLS.&quot; THE ONLY THING HE WANTS FROM THE ESTATE IS HIS DAD&#39;S COLLECTION OF LUGER PISTOLS, BUT IT&#39;S BEEN A CHALLENGE GETTING THEM TO PARIS. &quot;DAD WAS TRYING TO MAKE ME GO HALFSIES WITH HIM ON GETTING AN AK-47. DAD WAS REALLY INTO GUNS. LOOKING BACK, IT&#39;S KIND OF FUNNY. THAT&#39;S MY MEMORY OF HIM AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING THEM.&quot; GROWING UP IN SUBURBAN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA IN THE 60S AND 70S, THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN OWENS AND HIS DAD WERE VOLATILE AT BEST. &quot;HE WAS VERY ACTIVELY CONSERVATIVE, SO OBVIOUSLY I WAS A KARMIC REACTION TO THAT. WE WERE AFFECTIONATE IN THE SENTIMENTAL WAY BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE WERE MORTAL ENEMIES.&quot; A SOCIAL WORKER FOR THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT, HIS DAD&#39;S WORLDVIEW WAS TAINTED BY SCEPTICISM. &quot;WHEN EVERY DAY IT&#39;S ABOUT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO WRONG, THAT CAN COLOR THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT SOCIETY; MISTRUSTFUL, SUSPICIOUS, DISAPPOINTED. HE HAD NO TACT — AMAZINGLY INSENSITIVE! HE WAS SOCIALLY A DISASTER. OBVIOUSLY HE DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY FRIENDS,&quot; OWENS RECALLS. &quot;MOM ON THE OTHER HAND IS JUST THE SWEETEST MEXICAN LADY. HIS ATTITUDE ABOUT RACE WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT THE FACT THAT HE MARRIED A MINORITY AND HAD A CHILD TOGETHER, I NEVER COULD FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WORKED IN HIS HEAD.&quot; AFTER AN INTERVIEW OWENS DID WITH THE NEW YORKER IN 2008, HIS DAD CALLED HIM UP. DIDN&#39;T YOU CALL HIM A NAZI? &quot;I CALLED HIM AN ADORABLE NAZI,&quot; HE QUIPS. &quot;DAD WAS FINE WITH THAT, BUT I SAID THAT HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS WOMEN AND GAY RIGHTS WAS JUST REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR ME. HE WAS VERY CONFRONTATIONAL INTELLECTUALLY, SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS COOL WITH US. I MISCALCULATED THE BALANCE OF MY HAVING MORE OF A PUBLIC FORUM THAN HE DID, AND THAT&#39;S WHAT CREATED THE PROBLEM.&quot; OBSERVING OWENS IN THE FAMILY-ORIENTED, DECIDEDLY UN-PUNK ENVIRONMENT OF THE LIDO, WITH ITS STRIPY PARASOLS AND NEAT CABANAS, HIS FATHER&#39;S VALUES WEREN&#39;T TOTALLY IN VAIN — EVEN IF HIS SON LIVES AN UTTERLY NONCONFORMIST LIFE, BISEXUAL AND MARRIED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS MICHÈLE LAMY, WHOM HE MET IN THE 80S AND FOUNDED HIS BRAND WITH. &quot;WHAT&#39;S AMAZING IS THAT DAD HAD THIS WEIRD AESTHETIC SIDE,&quot; OWENS NOTES. &quot;HE DEVOURED CLASSICAL MUSIC AND JAPANESE ART, SO HE HAD THIS SENSITIVITY THAT HE SUPPRESSED.&quot; CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT, IT INSPIRED IN OWENS AN ETERNAL OBSESSION WITH THE ARTS AND ITS MASTERS. (HERE HE IS ONLY A SPEEDBOAT AWAY FROM THE BIENNALE, &quot;THE OLYMPICS OF ART&quot;.) HE LOVES RICHARD WAGNER, WHOSE SYMPHONIES MIGHT POSE SOME SERIOUS COMPETITION TO VISCONTI&#39;S SOUL-CRUSHING GUSTAV MAHLER SCORE IF OWENS EVER DECIDES TO ADAPT HIS OWN DEATH IN VENICE. HIS FAVORITE ARCHITECT IS ELIEL SAARINEN, WHOSE GLOOMY DINING SUITE FROM 1901 IS SCATTERED AROUND THE CONDO. THERE&#39;S A JOSEPH URBAN VASE FROM THE SAME DECADE THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN, AND BOOKS ON THE JUGENDSTIL OF THE ERA. AT ONE POINT OWENS WANDERS OFF TO FIND MORE LITERATURE, MURMURING SOMETHING ABOUT ALBERT SPEER. HE JUST GOT GLASSES BUT LIKE ANY TRUE INTELLECTUAL HE KEEPS LOSING THEM. &quot;I WALK AROUND WITH THEM ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD BEING MAD BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHERE MY GLASSES ARE.&quot; HE RECOGNIZES HIS FATHER&#39;S CONFLICTING PERSONALITY TRAITS IN OTHER MEN. &quot;SOME MEN, WHO HAVE HAD STORES SELLING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, EXQUISITE THINGS, WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TASTE, WILL END UP BEING THESE COWBOYS THAT ARE KIND OF MACHO-AGGRESSIVE MEN.&quot; THEY&#39;RE THE PEOPLE WHO SCREAM AT GONDOLIERS, LIKE BOGARDE&#39;S PERPETUALLY INFURIATED PROTAGONIST, PENT UP BY UNRESOLVED EMOTIONS AND REPRESSED DESIRES. &quot;DAD&#39;S INTELLECTUAL BULLYING OF ME HAD GOOD RESULTS, AND I&#39;VE ALWAYS WONDERED IF I HAD A COMPLETELY WELL-ADJUSTED FAMILY LIFE WITH A FATHER, WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW FEAR AND SHAME IN THE HOUSE, HOW WOULD I HAVE TURNED OUT?&quot; OWENS MUSES. &quot;I WOULDN&#39;T HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO REACT TO SO I&#39;M GRATEFUL FOR THAT.&quot; SITTING ON HIS TERRACE LOOKING AT THAT BLUE VENETIAN LAGOON, THE MELANCHOLY IN OWENS IS EVIDENT, EVEN IF IT CONTRASTS ALL THE FREEDOM AND COMPASSION HIS WORK STANDS FOR. THE SON HAS BECOME THE OPPOSITE OF HIS FATHER — SOFT ON THE SHELL, HARDER AT THE CORE. &quot;MALE EGO IS SOMETHING I&#39;M ALWAYS FASCINATED WITH BECAUSE I KNOW IT&#39;S BEEN SUCH A DRIVING FORCE FOR ME, AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND I&#39;M AWARE OF IT AND I&#39;M KIND OF ASHAMED OF IT. BUT I&#39;M ALSO AWARE THAT IT&#39;S THE WAY IT HAS TO BE SOMETIMES.&quot; NOW OWENS ROAMS HIS CASUAL HOLIDAY RETREAT IN PENSIVE SOLITUDE, LISTENING TO PEGGY LEE, DESIGNING HIS COLLECTION, WORKING OUT, AND EATING SIMPLE DINNERS OF EGGS AND TOAST AND CHEESE. &quot;I REALLY WITHDREW. I FOUND AN ISLAND AND AN IVORY TOWER ON AN ISLAND,&quot; HE ADMITS, WITH THE IRONIC DISTANCE THAT OFTEN ARMORS HIS STATEMENTS. &quot;PARIS IS GREAT, BUT WHEN I DIE I WANT TO DIE NEXT TO THE SEA.&quot; IT DOESN&#39;T HAVE TO BE ON THE LIDO, HE POINTS OUT, BUT THE FICTIONALLY LOADED CONFINEMENTS OF THIS ESCAPIST SANDBAR, SUNNY AS IT IS, ARE UNDENIABLY MOROSE AND PERFECT FOR IT. &quot;IT&#39;S BEEN VERY DEATH IN VENICE THIS MONTH. AND THEN THERE&#39;S THIS UNDERLYING SENSE OF GRIT. THERE HASN&#39;T BEEN A WAR FOR A LONG TIME AND THIS GENERATION HASN&#39;T REALLY KNOWN THAT KIND OF WAR.

SEE HOW BAD I AM ABOUT SPORTS?” IT IS EARLY MARCH AND WE ARE SAT IN HIS HOME AND HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS. THE LATEST COLLECTION IS ENTITLED MASTODON, THE SAME NAME AS HIS AUTUMN-WINTER 16–17 MENSWEAR COLLECTION, SHOWN IN JANUARY THIS YEAR. HE HAD BRIEFLY CONSIDERED CALLING IT ‘MASTODONETTE’, BUT ULTIMATELY REJECTED THIS FEMINISED IDEA. MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE TOO DISNEY FOR OWENS. BOTH COLLECTIONS WERE INSPIRED BY SOMETHING LITERALLY DARKER: THE LA BREA TAR PITS. THIS LOS ANGELES LANDMARK IS FAMED FOR PREHISTORIC ANIMAL BONES FOUND PRESERVED AFTER THE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES WANDERED INTO THAT OOZE MANY MILLENNIA AGO. OWENS’ CLOTHING DOESN’T PLAY ON THE SUPPOSED GENDER DIVIDE – ALTHOUGH HE SAYS HIS MEN’S COLLECTIONS ARE OFTEN MORE ABOUT “WHAT D CKS MEN ARE, WITH THAT DESIRE TO DOMINATE.” YET THERE IS A TOUGHNESS AND A SOFTNESS ON DISPLAY FOR BOTH SEXES, AND AN AIM TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING DELIBERATE, BALANCED, CAREFULLY EDITED AND STILL SOMEHOW CRAZED, FREEFORM AND PHYSICALLY INSTINCTIVE FOR EACH IN HIS CLOTHING – “CONTROL AND COLLAPSE” ARE THE DEFINING WORDS FOR THE DESIGNER. QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO, IN ANOTHER OF OUR INTERVIEWS, HE HAD SAID: “A LOT OF CLOTHING OUT THERE IS ABOUT PEOPLE STRIDENTLY HAVING TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES TO EVERYBODY, MAKING A BIG FUSS ABOUT WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL THEY ARE. THEY WANT TO BE RECOGNISED AND THEY ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAN ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING. I THINK THE CLOTHES I DESIGN ARE A CERTAIN REFLECTION OF A PULLING BACK AND NOT HAVING TO PROCLAIM WHO YOU ARE ALL THE TIME.” WHEN OWENS HAD ORIGINALLY SPOKEN ABOUT SPORTS AND FASHION THAT WAS, IN PART, WHAT I BELIEVE HE MEANT. THAT DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE, TO BE A BIGGER PART OF A WHOLE, TO BE DRIVEN BY INSTINCT AND INTUITION AS MUCH AS STRATEGY AND TO ENJOY A CERTAIN SUBLIMATION OF SELF… WHILE FASHION MIGHT BE SEEN AS A PURSUIT OF RAMPANT INDIVIDUALISTS, IT ACTUALLY ISN’T. ON THE PART OF THE DESIGNER/CREATIVE DIRECTOR, IT OFTEN INVOLVES CHANNELLING INSPIRATION THAT COMES FROM OUTSIDE THE INDIVIDUAL, AND BEING A CONDUIT OR A MEDIUM FOR AN INEXPLICABLE FORCE THAT SOMEHOW GUIDES A CREATIVE PERSON IN WHAT HE OR SHE DOES – AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS DOES NOT INVOLVE LISTENING TO FOCUS GROUPS, MARKETING OR MERCHANDISING PEOPLE. ON THE PART OF THE ENLIGHTENED CONSUMER, IT IS NOT ABOUT AMASSING A GREAT GLUT OF CLOTHING FOR THE SHOWY SAKE OF IT ALL, BUT FOLLOWING A FASHION DESIGNER AND A BRAND THE WAY SOME MIGHT FOLLOW A FOOTBALL TEAM. THIS INVOLVES HAVING AN EMOTIONAL COMMITMENT TO A DESIGNER AND THEIR OUTPUT – THERE ARE GOOD SEASONS AND THERE ARE BAD SEASONS BUT THEY ARE STILL YOUR TEAM. AND AS THE SAYING GOES, THERE IS NO I IN TEAM; THIS IS ABOUT BELIEVING IN FASHION AS SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOU. JUST LIKE FOOTBALL, OR WHATEVER YOUR CHOSEN SPORT MIGHT BE, FASHION IS EMOTIVE AND IN NEED OF LOYALTY AND COMMITMENT. IT IS ABOUT BUYING CLOTHES THAT HAVE A DEFINED THOUGHT PROCESS, TECHNIQUE AND PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THEM, RATHER THAN ‘OH, THAT’S A NICE JUMPER. IT GOES WITH MY EYES.’ WOULD YOU SUPPORT A FOOTBALL TEAM JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKED THE COLOUR OF THE KIT? THERE IS MUCH MORE TO FASHION THAN THAT, AND PARTICULARLY TO RICK OWENS’ FASHION. “THAT’S WHAT IT ALWAYS WAS IN THE PAST; IT WAS BACKING A TEAM,” SAYS OWENS OF HOW FASHION WORKS FOR HIM. “AND IF IT IS A CASE OF BUYING THINGS STRAIGHT AFTER A SHOW, IT DEMYSTIFIES FASHION TOO MUCH. PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG AND THAT THERE IS AN IDEA OR MINDSET BEHIND IT. JUST SAYING ‘I WANT TO SELL YOU THIS,’ FEELS QUITE DISRESPECTFUL TO ME. MAYBE FASHION IS LIKE SPORT IN THE WAY IT HAS GROWN INTO A STADIUM EVENT WHEN IT USED TO BE FAR MORE PERSONAL, MORE CULTISH.” SAYING THAT, RICK OWENS IS AT THE HEAD OF A FULLY-FLEDGED ‘LIFESTYLE BRAND’ AND A PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL ONE. THE DESIGNER IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST INDEPENDENTS IN THE WORLD AND, LET’S REMEMBER, GIORGIO ARMANI IS ALSO AMONG THAT NUMBER. RICK OWENS BRISTLES AT THIS IDEA WITH ALL OF ITS ASPIRATIONAL AND BOURGEOIS CONNOTATIONS – ALTHOUGH HE IS A FAN OF ARMANI – AND YET HIS TOO IS A LIFESTYLE BRAND WITH VAST CLOTHING COLLECTIONS FOR WOMEN AND MEN, AN E-COMMERCE SITE, A FLOURISHING FURNITURE BUSINESS, OBJET D’ART, LEATHER GOODS, JEWELLERY, BOOKS AND EVEN A LINE OF SWIMWEAR. YES, SWIMWEAR. IT IS A LIFESTYLE BRAND ALTHOUGH, TO REASSURE THE DESIGNER, I ALWAYS STRESS THAT THIS IS THE LIFESTYLE BRAND OF A SICK, TWISTED PERVERT – WHICH COMFORTS HIM SOMEWHAT. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS A BRAND INTRINSICALLY BASED ON AND LINKED TO RICK OWENS’ OWN LIFE. AND THAT’S THE DIFFERENCE YOU SEE; DESPITE ITS LEVIATHAN SIZE, RICK OWENS THE BRAND IS STILL PERSONAL, STILL CULTISH. IT IS THE REASON WHY IT HAS SO MANY FERVENT SUPPORTERS, AS MAD KEEN AS ANY FOOTBALL FANS OR RELIGIOUS DEVOTEES. YOU JUST HAVE TO ENTER ONE OF HIS SHOW SPACES TO SEE THEM ALL, GATHERED EN MASSE, INSTANTLY IDENTIFIABLE. “WHEN I WAS A KID GOING TO SEE THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, THAT WAS THE LIFE I WANTED. ALL THOSE CHEERFUL, WEIRDO FREAKS – I WANTED TO BE ONE OF THEM,” EXPLAINS THE DESIGNER. “NOW, I WALK INTO MY SHOWS AND I LOOK AT EVERYONE AND THINK ‘JESUS, I FINALLY GOT THERE.’” YET, DESPITE BEING THE SELF-MADE FRANK N. FURTER OF FASHION, THERE IS SOMETHING IN RICK OWENS THAT AT THE SAME TIME SEEKS QUIET REPOSE AND THE SUBLIMATION OF SELF – YOU CAN ALSO SEE AND FEEL THIS IN HIS CLOTHING, ATTUNED AS IT IS IN PART TO A SILENT, SENSUOUS, NON-OSTENTATIOUS FORM OF LUXURY. THIS IS ALSO A PARTICULAR CONCERN OF THE MASTODON COLLECTIONS. “HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU ABOUT THE ONLY OTHER JOB I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE?” ENQUIRES THE DESIGNER. “I WOULD LIKE TO BE HEAD GARDENER AT THE VATICAN. ALL THE PAGEANTRY, MODESTY, CORRUPTION AND PURITY OF THAT POSITION…” THIS IS SOMETHING OF A REVERIE FOR OWENS – I DON’T KNOW IF HE HAS THE SLIGHTEST IDEA ABOUT ACTUAL GARDENING. SAYING THAT, ROMAN CATHOLICISM IS SOMETHING THAT HAS CERTAINLY SHAPED HIS AESTHETIC CONCERNS AND IMPACTS ON THE IDEAS BEHIND MASTODON. “THE VANITY OF HUMANITY,” HE SIGHS. “THINKING THAT WE DESERVE TO GO OUT IN A FIERY APOCALYPSE – THAT’S WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT MY SHOW WAS ABOUT, BUT IT WASN’T. IT WAS THE OPPOSITE. I THINK IT WILL BE MORE A DISAPPEARANCE IN A BANAL EVAPORATION AND MAYBE IT WILL BE VERY LOVELY. MAYBE.” IN THE WORDS OF T.S. ELIOT: FOR THINE IS LIFE IS FOR THINE IS THE THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS NOT WITH A BANG BUT A WHIMPER.

FROM THE MEDIA FRENZY SURROUNDING HIS “HUMAN BACKPACKS”, HOWEVER, RISES A STATEMENT ON WOMANHOOD THAT LASTS. SHINING A NEW LIGHT ON THE MUCH-DEBATED DESIGNER, GLAMCULT WAS HAPPY TO ARRANGE A VIRTUAL MEETING BETWEEN THE FAMED CALIFORNIAN AND PHOTOGRAPHER RICK CASTRO. A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FORMER LOVERS, COMMON COLLABORATORS, LONG-TIME FRIENDS AND RADICAL CULT ICONS. RICK CASTRO: HELLO RICK, IT’S RICK. WHEN YOU APPROACH DESIGNING, IS IT A REACTION TO THE TIMES AND YOUR SURROUNDINGS, OR DO YOU WANT TO CREATE YOUR OWN WORLD? RICK OWENS: VERY MUCH BOTH. CREATING MY WORLD IS MY REACTION. RC: FOR S/S16 I REALLY ENJOYED YOUR FABRICS, ESPECIALLY THE SNAKESKIN. WHAT KIND OF SNAKES WERE USED AND HOW ARE THEY HARVESTED? RO: XENOPELTIS UNICOLOUR [OR SUNBEAM] SNAKES ARE HUNTED IN INDONESIA FOR THE MEAT AND THE SKINS. THE TRANSPARENT PROCESSING IS DONE IN ITALY THOUGH. WE DID SOME LONG GLOVES IN THIS SNAKESKIN THAT ARE SUPER FRAGILE, UTTERLY IMPRACTICAL AND GORGEOUS. ACTUALLY, VERY FETISH. RC: ARE YOU MOVING AWAY FROM LEATHER AND ANIMAL SKINS AND GOING MORE INTO SYNTHETIC FABRICS? RO: I’LL ALWAYS, ALWAYS DO LEATHER. BUT I LOVE METALLIZED FABRICS THAT LOOK LIKE CAR CRASHES. WOULD METAL BE CONSIDERED SYNTHETIC? I ALSO USE NYLON EVERY SEASON… RC: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF FABRICS AND CLOTHING CREATED BY 3D PRINTING? RO: I HAVEN’T SEEN ENOUGH OF IT TO REALLY JUDGE, BUT I’M NOT ATTRACTED ENOUGH BY THE IDEA TO INVESTIGATE… SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE GREAT FOR FAST FASHION. RC: WHAT KIND OF FABRICATIONS/CLOTHING DO YOU SEE AS THE FUTURE? RO: IT WOULD BE SMUG OF ME TO MAKE ANY KIND OF PREDICTION, AND FASHION IS SUCH A WEIRD AND WONDERFULLY UNPREDICTABLE THING. BEING SURPRISED IN FASHION IS WHAT WE’RE ALL LOOKING FOR. RC: WHAT’S YOUR ALL-TIME FAVOURITE ITEM YOU’VE DESIGNED? RO: I LIKE MY MONSTER BODY BAGS A LOT, BUT THAT’S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY’RE RECENT. I LIKE HOW THEY ERASE EVERYTHING: SEX, DETAIL, THE HISTORY OF FASHION—THEY JUST CREATE A MONOLITH SUPPORTING YOUR HEAD. KIND OF LIKE A CONCRETE KAFTAN. RC: WHAT’S THE SEXIEST THING A MAN CAN WEAR? RO: KINDNESS. RC: WHAT’S THE SEXIEST THING A WOMAN CAN WEAR? RO: KINDNESS. RC: DO YOU BELIEVE IN FETISH? WHAT DOES FETISH MEAN TO YOU? RO: I BELIEVE IN COMPLETE IMMERSION IN AND EXPLORATION OF ONE’S PERSONAL INTERESTS. I BELIEVE IN TAKING THE SIMPLEST OF LIFE’S JOYS AND ELABORATING ON AND CELEBRATING THEM. BE IT SEX, TEA OR KITTENS. RC: WHERE DO YOU SPEND THE MAJORITY OF YOUR TIME? RO: I SPLIT MY TIME BETWEEN PARIS AND VENICE, ITALY. RC: SO WHAT’S YOUR CURRENT FAVOURITE CITY? RO: I JUST GOT A BUTT-UGLY ROOFTOP CONDO ON THE LIDO BEACH IN VENICE THAT HAS A 360° VIEW WITH THE ADRIATIC SEA ON ONE SIDE AND PIAZZA SAN MARCO IN THE DISTANCE ON THE OTHER SIDE. THIS PART OF VENICE IS VERY PROVINCIAL AND QUIET AND NEXT TO THE SEA, BUT BEING SECONDS AWAY FROM MAJOR ART IS PRETTY GREAT. RC: HAVE YOU SPENT MUCH TIME IN AMSTERDAM OR OTHER PARTS OF THE NETHERLANDS? RO: I HAVEN’T. MAYBE I’M AFRAID OF TOO MANY DISTRACTIONS AND TEMPTATIONS. RC: TELL ME ABOUT YOUR INSTALLATION WITH HUMA BHABHA FOR JASON JACQUES GALLERY. RO: JASON JACQUES IS SOMEONE WHO HAS THE MOST EXQUISITE TASTE, HE’S A NEW YORK DEALER WHO SPECIALIZES IN OBSCURE ART NOUVEAU STONEWARE AND I’VE BOUGHT SOME OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS FROM HIM. HE ASKED ME TO CURATE HIS BOOTH AND HUMA BHABA IS SOMEONE I KNOW AND LIKE. IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A PERFECT MIX. RC: TELL ME ABOUT THE PLANS FOR LES DEUX CAFÉ IN VENICE. RO: YOU KNOW HUN, SHE [MICHELLE LAMY] HAS SO MANY SCENARIOS THAT WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE. RC: WHAT DO YOU MISS ABOUT HOLLYWOOD? RO: HUSTLERS ON SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD. RC: I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU HATED CATS, NOW YOU HAVE ONE. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? RO: WHO ON EARTH CAN RESIST A KITTEN? HER NAME IS GAIA BUT I LIKE SHRIEKING “P SSY” IN A CRINGEY FALSETTO. RC: WILL YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AND BE DRINKING TEA AND DOING YOGA SOON? RO: CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT WHAT? INSTEAD OF TEA I DO GREEN JUICES AND INSTEAD OF YOGA I DO WEIGHTS AND STRETCH, BUT I THINK THE GOALS ARE THE SAME: SERENITY AND BEING ABLE TO SPREAD LOVE. RC: NOW THAT BOWIE IS GONE, ARE THERE ANY ICONS LEFT THAT ARE WORTH IDOLIZING? RO: I AM IDOLIZING CHRISTEENE AND THE DIVINE DAVID. RC: WHERE WILL YOU SPEND YOUR GOLDEN YEARS? RO: VENICE.

TINY, WIZENED AND NUT BROWN, SHE WALKS CALMLY, CURIOUSLY; TURNING HER GREY–BLUE GAZE THIS WAY AND THAT, UNTIL IT ALIGHTS UPON SOMETHING THAT MIGHT INTEREST HER FOR A MOMENT, BEFORE UNHURRIEDLY MOVING ON, THE ENIGMATIC, WOODY AND SEXLESS SCENT OF SANTAL WAFTING IN HER WAKE. THE VESSEL THAT CONTAINS MICHÈLE LAMY THE MYTH AND LEGEND, DESPITE BEING IN ITS EARLY 70S, IS FULL OF A SERENE VITALITY. AND EVEN WITH THE LEVEL OF WORSHIP AND FANDOM AIMED AT HER FROM CERTAIN CIRCLES, LAMY IS LOW-KEY. SHE IS NOT SOME THIRSTY DEITY WHO DERIVES POWER FROM THE BENEDICTIONS OF LESSER MORTALS. SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, EVEN WITH IT’S ACUITY, HERS IS NOT A GAZE YOU INSTINCTIVELY FEEL THE NEED TO SHRINK FROM. AS INTERESTING AND FASCINATING A CHARACTER AS SHE IS IN THE CREATIVE SPHERE, AND AS FABULOUS AS SHE HERSELF HAS WRITTEN HER HISTORY, MICHÈLE IS WITHOUT AFFECTATION. PERHAPS IT’S THAT SHE’S BEEN AT THE RODEO LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE LET GO OF THE QUIETLY DESPERATE HUMAN DESIRE FOR NOT ONLY ACCEPTANCE, BUT ADMIRATION. LIKELY BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN AND DONE THAT A THOUSAND TIMES OVER ALREADY. HER HANDS ARE SMALL, AND SHE HOLDS THEM QUITE STILL WHEN SHE IS SPEAKING; PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVILY LADEN WITH RINGS, HER WRISTS MANACLED WITH HUGE CUFFS UP TO HER ELBOWS – THEY MUST BE WHAT KEEPS HER ARMS SO TONED. HER FINGERS, OF COURSE, ARE DIP DYED IN HENNA, A SIGNATURE. IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE DYE MIGHT PERHAPS HIDE CIGARETTE STAINED DIGITS, WHILST HER THROATY VOICE EVIDENCES A LIFETIME OF EXHALING CLOUDS OF SMOKE AND GLAMOUR. MOST PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH BEING INTERESTING. MOST PEOPLE ARE ALSO COMPLETELY UNAWARE THAT THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE, ARE IN FACT, USUALLY THE MOST INTERESTED. INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM, AND IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM, EVEN AT ITS MOST MUNDANE. DURING OUR INTERVIEW, MICHÈLE OFTEN ASKS ME QUESTIONS ABOUT MYSELF. SHE IS INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHERE I’M FROM, MY LIFE HERE IN HONG KONG, AND WHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE I CAME HERE. SHE GRACIOUSLY GIVES TIME TO THE PEOPLE WALKING PAST WHO WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH HER OR EXPRESS THEIR ADMIRATION OF HER OR TO TELL HER ABOUT THEIR LATEST PROJECT OR EXHIBITION. SHE WATCHES THEIR VIDEOS, LISTENS TO THEIR ELEVATOR PITCHES, AND ACCEPTS GUSHING COMPLIMENTS AND MESSAGES FOR RICK ABOUT, “THAT TIME THEY MET IN PARIS BACKSTAGE,”, AND FOR HER TO “PLEASE SAY HELLO TO SO-AND-SO FROM ME, HE’LL REMEMBER ME IF YOU SAY MY NAME!”. OTHERS DISCREETLY FRAME THEIR PICTURES FROM A COUPLE OF METRES AWAY, STRATEGICALLY FRAMING HER WITHIN THEIR SEFIES WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TO ASK FOR A PHOTO. IN BETWEEN ALL OF THAT, WE TALK ABOUT DAY TO DAY THINGS AS WE SMOKE CIGARETTES AND CHAT, LEANING AGAINST THE HIP-HIGH METAL BARRIERS LINING THE HONG KONG SIDEWALK. DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT HONG KONG, OR ASIA, EVEN? I HAVE A NEPHEW WHO LIVES IN SHANGHAI SINCE 12 YEARS, HE HAS A COMPANY CALLED PIG CHINA, THEY DO COMMERCIAL AND MOVIES SOMEHOW. HE STARTED HIS COMPANY IN LA. I’M FRENCH, BUT I THINK I’M MORE AMERICAN. THE ONLY THING IS, I HAVE A CURSE BECAUSE I HAVE THE ACCENT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS 12, I WAS SORT OF LEARNING ENGLISH, BUT I ALWAYS HAVE THIS ACCENT, AND I THOUGHT I GOT A CURSE BECAUSE IN A PREVIOUS LIFE, I DON’T KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG. BUT THEN SOMEONE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE FRENCH HAVE THE SMALLEST EARS, BECAUSE THE SOUNDS ARE ALL LIKE “SHOU SHOU SHOU” SO ALREADY AT 12, A LOT OF US DON’T HEAR A LOT OF SOUNDS RIGHT. WHAT IS YOUR EARLIEST MEMORY? WHAT’S THE MEMORY THAT YOU HAVE HELD ON TO? I THINK REMEMBER THINGS FROM WHEN I WAS 2. BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW I WAS JUST BORN AFTER D-DAY. AND MY PARENTS MET IN THE RESISTANCE, SO THERE WERE ALL THOSE STORIES THEY TOLD. SO I HAVE A FEELING THAT I SORT OF LIVED THROUGH IT, A LITTLE BIT. LIKE, THE GOOD PART. MY PARENTS ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT LIKE, “THAT SUMMER THE PEAS WERE SO GOOD,”, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES, YOU GET THE FEELING THAT YOU HAVE MET PEOPLE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I NEVER THINK ABOUT THE PAST. I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHAT I’M GOING TO DO TOMORROW, WHAT IS EXCITING ABOUT TOMORROW. LIKE HERE, I KNOW I COULD FEEL AT HOME VERY QUICKLY, BECAUSE I KNOW I WILL MEET THE RIGHT PEOPLE. YOU KNOW I AM HERE, FOLLOWING RICK WITH SOMETHING THERE, AND THEN YOU CAME IN THE PICTURE. AND THIS IS TO ME, A SENSE THAT THERE IS A FOLLOW UP TO THE STORY. I LIKE ENCOUNTERS. I ALWAYS BELIEVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEN. SO YOU BELIEVE IN ENERGY? THAT LIKE ATTRACTS LIKE? THAT’S WHY YOU HAVE ALL THESE AMAZING ENCOUNTERS, RIGHT? EXACTLY. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING. I’VE BEEN LIVING FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW. IT’S NOT LIKE I’M FOLLOWING A TRAIL. I DON’T SEE WHAT I DON’T WANT TO SEE, IN A WAY. IS IMMORTALITY IMPORTANT TO YOU? IN THIS DAY AND AGE, DO YOU THINK IT’S STILL POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE, LIKE PERHAPS YOURSELF, OR RICK, THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME KIND OF IMMORTALITY THAT MARIE ANTOINETTE, OR CLEOPATRA – IS THAT POSSIBLE? I DON’T THINK SO! THERE WILL BE SO MANY WITH WHAT, INSTAGRAM AND SUCH I DON’T MAKE THINGS CHANGE, THAT THEY STAY IN HISTORY, AND I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH SCIENCE, EVEN IF IT’S NOT WITHIN THE NEWSPAPER THAT RIGHT NOW, THE BLACK HOLE, AFTER THAT, WE DISCOVER THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ON MARS, NOT THAT I WILL SEE, BUT VERY SOON. THIS IS WHAT MAKE YOU CHANGE, AND AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THESE DISCOVERIES, AND AT THE SAME TIME, PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR RELIGION FROM THE 8TH CENTURY, SO IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH THAT. FOR ME, IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK WHY IT CANNOT BE A RELIGION BEHIND IT, SO WE GO TO TRIBES, AND WE WERE THINKING THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT TRIBES OF PEOPLE. BUT NOW WHAT IS GREAT IS THAT THE TRIBE DON’T NEED TO BE FROM THE SAME LOCATION, AND PEOPLE CAN FIND EACH OTHER IN DIFFERENT PLACES, AND THAT WILL CONTINUE A TRAIN OF THOUGHT, BUT I DON’T THINK I’M GOING TO BE BORN. I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S IMMORTALITY IN THE FIRST DEGREE, BUT I AM INTERESTED IN THOSE TRIBE THINGS. DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF PART OF A TRIBE? WHO IS YOUR TRIBE? YOU KNOW SO FIRST, THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS TOLD IN MY FAMILY, BUT THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO NORTH AFRICA. I WAS 17, 18, AND I FELT I WAS GOING HOME. AND THREE WEEKS LATER, I WAS IN A TENT WITH SOME BERBERS DOING MUSIC AND I FOUND OUT THAT THIS PART OF FRANCE WHERE MY FAMILY IS FROM, – AND THE WAY WE LOOK ALSO – BELONGED TO SPAIN AT THE TIME. THE MOOR WERE THERE TOO, SO I HAVE BERBER AND MOOR GENES FROM LIKE, TEN GENERATIONS AGO, BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE NEVER MOVED, OTHER PEOPLE JUST WENT THERE AND CROSS-POLLINATED. MY OWN MOTHER, SHE WAS COVERING HERSELF WITH POWDER IN THE SUMMER. AT THE TIME, PEOPLE WERE GETTING SO TANNED WHEN THEY WERE WORKING IN THE FIELD, AND SHE WAS A LADY THAT LUNCHED! AND WHEN WE WERE KIDS, WITH MY SISTER ON THE BEACH, PEOPLE WERE TALKING TO US IN ENGLISH BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT WE WERE INDIAN. SO EVERYWHERE I GO, EVEN IN THE SUBWAY IN PARIS, PEOPLE TALK TO ME IN ARABIC, BECAUSE THEY THINK I’M A BERBER, WITH BLUE EYES. AND THEN WHEN I GO TO BALI, THEY THINK I’M FROM LEBANON. IN INDIA, I WAS LOOKING VERY MUCH INDIAN AND YESTERDAY ON THE PLANE, THE WOMAN TOLD ME YOU ARE VIETNAMESE. SO I ALWAYS SORT OF STICK, WHEREVER I GO, EXCEPT IN PARIS, WHERE NOBODY CAN REALLY TELL WHERE I AM FROM, OR IN ENGLAND BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MIXES. EVERYWHERE THAT IS SOUTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN, I BELONG! SO ANYWAY IT’S GOOD, I FEEL LIKE I PASS. IN THE LAST COLLECTION RICK DID, I READ A REVIEW WHERE HE MENTIONED THAT HE WAS INSPIRED BY HUMAN DECLINE. WITH THAT IN MIND, DO YOU THINK WE HAVE HIT PEAK CIVILISATION ALREADY, AND THAT NOW, HUMANITY IS IN A STATE OF DECLINE? IS THAT WHERE WE ARE? I DON’T THINK SO. I THINK WHEN RICK TALKS ABOUT DECLINE, HE LIKES THIS FEEL OF DEATH IN VENICE AND THE ROMANTIC FEELING ABOUT IT. YOU SEE, RICK HE ALWAYS LOOKS AT DEAD ARTISTS. AND I ALWAYS LOOK AT THE YOUNGEST ONES. SO TO ME HE HAS A ROMANTIC VISION THAT IS, YOU KNOW, THROUGH THE BOOKS AND LANGUAGE THAT IS VERY MUCH ROMANTIC. ON THE CONTRARY, THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WAR AND WHAT NOT, AND WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT. BUT I DON’T THINK WE’RE IN DECLINE. COMPATIBILITY. DO YOU THINK COMPATIBILITY IS ABOUT TWO PUZZLE PIECES FITTING PERFECTLY TOGETHER, OR IS COMPATIBILITY ABOUT ADAPTING AND MOULDING TO ANOTHER? IS IT ABOUT A PERFECT FIT, OR A MOULDING TOGETHER? I THINK IT’S ABOUT PERFECT FIT. EVEN IF THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT, THEY FIND THAT THEY GO TOGETHER. SIMPLE. ARE YOU SCARED OF ANYTHING? WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF, IF ANYTHING. I DON’T KNOW WHY PEOPLE SAY THAT I AM NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING. BEING AFRAID IS NOT SOMETHING – I JUST LIKE TO BE SURPRISED. I WANT ALWAYS TO DISCOVER SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO ADAPT TO. THIS IS WHY, WHAT IS AT THE SAME TIME EXCITING AND SAD, IS THAT YOU COME HERE AND THE FIRST THING YOU SEE IS A GUCCI AD. OR WHATEVER AD, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. THERE IS A WALL, WHERE NOW IT’S ALL THE SAME. AT ONE TIME, WHEN YOU WOULD GO TO SAINT TROPEZ, THERE WERE SHOES THAT WERE ONLY MADE IN SAINT TROPEZ, AND IN 30 YEARS, IT’S CHANGED COMPLETELY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE YOU HAVE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHANGED AND CULTURE THAT IS DIFFERENT AND YOU PASS ON THIS GLOBALISATION — ” [WE GET INTERRUPTED BY A WOMAN ON THE STREET SHE HAD MET THE NIGHT BEFORE. THEY EXCHANGE COMPLIMENTS IN FRENCH.] DO YOU LIKE TO TALK TO PEOPLE ON THE STREET? YES, I LOVE TO TALK WITH PEOPLE ON THE STREET. I LOVE IT. CAN YOU VERBALISE MAGIC TO YOU? WHAT IS MAGICAL TO YOU? IS THERE ANY MAGIC LEFT IN THE WORLD? I THINK THERE IS MAGIC EVERYWHERE. TO ME, MAGIC WAS, YOU KNOW, I JUST RUN INTO SOMEBODY. THIS IS WHY I LIKE TO GO PLACES ON THE STREET. LIKE YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT BEING IN THE CLUB AND SEEING SOMEBODY AND CREATING A STORY ABOUT THEM. EVEN IF THEY LOOK LIKE THE OPPOSITE THAT YOU THOUGHT. I FIND MAGIC IN THE SMALL WAY OF THINGS. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MAKE YOUR MAGIC WITH. FOR EXAMPLE, I FIND BOXING VERY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE ALL THE BOXING I MET A LOT OF PEOPLE. FROM THE FIRST DAY, WHEN I WENT TO SEE WHICH CLUB I WAS GOING TO AND FELT IT [MAGIC]. IN NEW YORK, I GO TO THIS BOXING CLUB, IT’S CALLED BOX AND BOOZE. YOU HAVE TO FIND A PATH. I’M SURE THAT WHEN YOU DISCOVER PEOPLE, THAT YOU KNOW IN A CERTAIN WAY, WHETHER IT CAN WORK. WHEN I LIVED IN LA I WAS AT THIS CLUB, WORKING AT LE DEUX CAFE, AND EVERYONE WAS TRAINING AT THIS WILD CARD BOXING CLUB. AND THROUGH THERE, AT LEAST RIGHT NOW, I’M SEEING A LOT OF THE WORLD THROUGH THE RULES OF BOXING. EVEN THOUGH I HATE FIGHTS IN A WAY, THERE IS SOMETHING TO BEING NAKED IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY, AND TRYING TO ESCAPE. LIKE PLAYING CHESS. YOU KNOW, THAT’S A KIND OF MAGIC TO ME, WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF FEELS, AND YOU PUT YOURSELF INTO THAT KIND OF SITUATION. I LIKE THE STAGE. I DO A LITTLE BIT OF STAGE NOW WITH CAECILIA TRIPP WHO IS A GREAT ARTIST. I NEVER KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO WITH HER, BUT THEN A FEW HOURS BEFORE, SHE TELLS ME WHAT IT’S ALL ABOUT. SHE SAYS “I HATE REHEARSAL, PEOPLE ARE NOT NATURAL AFTER REHEARSAL.”. SO I LIKE TO BE IN THIS SITUATION WHERE THAT MAGIC HAPPENS, MAGIC TO ME. WE DO IT TO MAKE A LITTLE TRIBE ALSO. I LIKE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW I WAS SURPRISED AFTER HAVING THIS PLACE IN LA, LE DEUX CAFE, FOR 12 YEARS, AND THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT. SO IT’S THE SAME THING, A LITTLE STAGE, AND YOU SAY, “WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN?” AND YOU DISCOVER THINGS. AND IT’S A WAY TO HAVE A PATH. BOXING IS A DANCE AS WELL IN A WAY, BETWEEN PEOPLE. YEAH, IT’S ALL ABOUT BEING FAST ON YOUR FEET. DO YOU HIT PEOPLE? I HIT A TRAINER. AND THEY DON’T HIT ME. BUT THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THE HIT. YOU KNOW THE ONLY TIME, I FOUGHT – BECAUSE IT’S ALL BY THE WEIGHT, YOU KNOW – SO WHO WAS THE SAME WEIGHT AS ME? IT’S ALL THE YOUNG KIDS, MEXICAN FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS. YOU THINK THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS NOT DOING THIS TO TAKE THEIR PLACE? NO! THE FIRST SECONDS ARE THE HARDEST, BECAUSE YOU DON’T KNOW HOW THEY ARE GOING TO MOVE. SO IF I’M IN THOSE FIRST SECONDS, I HAVE THIS RAGE IN ME LIKE I WANTED TO SLAP THEM, I ASK MYSELF, WHO RAISED THESE KIDS! WHO IS THIS LITTLE SHIT! BUT YES, IT’S LIKE DANCE. RHYTHM. VERY CLOSE TO HIP HOP. DO YOU STILL GO OUT AND ENJOY THAT? YES. BUT WITH RICK NOT SO MUCH. BUT WE STILL DANCE OUR STORIES TOGETHER. WE DON’T GO TO CLUB CLUB. RICK RICK OWENS AS AN AESTHETIC CONCEPT IS MONUMENTAL. THE CULT OF RICK IS FERVENT AND THE WAY MEMBERS REFER TO THEIR LEADER IS REVERENT. THIS WAS APPARENT FROM THE PILGRIMS CLAD IN TOP TO TOE FRESH-OFF-THE-RUNWAY LOOKS; THAT THE LOVE FOR RICK RUNS DEEP IN HONG KONG. DESPITE THE FRENZY THAT OCCURRED AROUND HIM, RICK WAS CALM, MEASURED AND ZEN. HE WAS PROTECTIVE OF HIS WIFE MICHELE, SQUEEZING HER SHOULDER AS IF GIVING HER SOME OF HIS ENERGY, AS THEY POSED FOR COUNTLESS PHOTOGRAPHS. HE RESPONDED IN A GENTLE, MATTER-OF-FACT WAY TO QUESTIONS, AND DELIVERED HIS STATEMENTS AND OPINIONS IN SOFT TERMS. HIS SPEECH WAS PEPPERED WITH ‘I GUESS-ES’, AND HE WAS ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF THE FORTUNE OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO WHERE HE IS TODAY. COOL, CALM AND COLLECTED, RICK OWENS IS THE CHILL DAD THAT EVERYONE WISHES THEY HAD. HE ASKED MORE THAN ONCE, SOMEWHAT WISTFULLY, WHETHER ANYONE PRESENT HAD ANY CHILDREN. HE AFTER ALL, CHOSE TO BIRTH HIS EPONYMOUS FASHION LABEL AS HIS CHILD AND LEGACY – HIS IMMORTALITY. NOW A FULLY GROWN MONSTER, RICK OWENS THE BRAND IS A WAY OF AESTHETIC EXISTENCE THAT GOES DEEPER THAN JUST CLOTHING. HE IS THE ORIGINAL HEALTH GOTH WHO MIGHT TELL YOU, “NOW I KNOW YOU MIGHT MAKE SOME BAD DECISIONS TONIGHT, BUT IT’S OKAY, AND IF YOU’D LIKE TO BREAK IT DOWN TOMORROW, I’LL BE HERE, BUT PLEASE DON’T VOMIT IN THE GREENHOUSE AGAIN, YOU’LL MESS WITH THE VENUS FLYTRAPS.” THAT RIGHT THERE SAYS FAR MORE ABOUT ME THAN IT DOES ABOUT RICK, BUT HIS AIR OF WARM UNDERSTANDING AND GENTLE ATTENTIVENESS WERE A FRESH COMFORT. ARE YOU STILL AMBITIOUS FOR SOMETHING? I AM. MORE AMBITIOUS THAN EVER, ALMOST. LIKE WHEN I GO TO THE FACTORY, I JUST GET ENRAGED WHEN I SEE ALL OF THESE MISTAKES. I’M NOT MEAN, I DON’T THINK I AM. I’M ALMOST MORE AMBITIOUS THAN I EVER WAS. WHEN I LOOK BACK AT THE STUFF I DO NOW, LIKE EVERYTHING THAT I FIT INTO A WEEK THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN SIX MONTHS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND MORE ENERGETIC. IT JUST PROVES THAT YOU CAN REALLY RISE TO THE OCCASION, IF YOU HAVE TO. IF YOU DECIDE THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO SURVIVE, YOU CAN JUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM YOURSELF. NOW I’VE LIVED IN PARIS FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS AND I HAVEN’T BEEN BACK TO LOS ANGELES SINCE I MOVED TO PARIS, AND I’M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY. IT MAKES ME NERVOUS. AMERICANS, OR LA? LA. I MEAN, I GO TO NEW YORK EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE AND I DON’T DISLIKE IT BUT - IT NEVER WAS ME. THERE’S THIS SENSE OF VIP-NESS AND THIS URGENCY FOR SOMETHING. THERE’S THIS FRENETIC ENERGY THAT, UM, I ALWAYS THINK OF IT AS THIS VIP ROOM OF THE US, AND THEN WHEN YOU’RE IN THE VIP ROOM, THERE’S ALL THESE OTHER VIP ROOMS AND THERE’S A VIP CORNER – THERE’S THAT THING IN NEW YORK, AND THE VALUES THERE, IT’S GRABBY. I GUESS I WAS AMBITIOUS? I MUST HAVE BEEN AMBITIOUS. IT WAS AMBITION TO MAKE SOMETHING OF VALUE. IT WASN’T EVEN THAT MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND STATUS, BUT THINGS WORKED OUT. AND I’M NOT COMPLAINING. IS IMMORTALITY IMPORTANT TO YOU? ABSOLUTELY. I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US. THAT’S WHY WE GET UP IN THE MORNING TO TRY AND DO STUFF. THAT’S WHY WE HAVE BABIES. AND THAT’S WHY WE TEACH OUR BABIES THE VALUES THAT WE BELIEVE IN. THAT’S WHAT IMMORTALITY IS. AND FOR ME, I DIDN’T HAVE KIDS, BECAUSE I’M TOO SELFISH, BUT, DOING WHAT I’M DOING IS MY BABY. THAT’S WHAT I’M GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND, AND I WANT MY BABY TO BE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD. DO YOU GUYS HAVE BABIES? NO? DO YOU THINK THAT IMMORTALITY IN THIS DAY AND AGE IS ACHIEVABLE IN THE SAME WAY AS CLEOPATRA OR ALEXANDER THE GREAT? IS THAT STILL POSSIBLE? [RICK LAUGHS WRYLY] LEGENDS? SURE. I’M SURE THERE WILL BE LEGENDS. IT’LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHO SURVIVES THIS GENERATION. THE WHOLE INTERNET THING HAS EVENED OUT THE PLAYING FIELD AND EVERYBODY HAS A VOICE NOW, AND I HAVEN’T RESEARCHED IT, BUT I THINK AT THE TOWER OF BABEL, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME KIND OF RELATION THERE. BUT THEIR PROBLEM WAS, I THINK THAT THEY HAVE – I DON’T REMEMBER, I’LL HAVE TO GOOGLE IT AGAIN, BUT IT PROBABLY BEARS GOOGLING IN LIGHT OF OUR GENERATION. BUT YEAH THERE ARE SO MANY VOICES IN FASHION, IT’S OVERSATURATED, WHICH IS FINE, IT’S JUST TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE, AND THAT’S WHAT HAD TO HAPPEN ANYWAY. THERE’S NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT, BUT IT’S REALLY HAPPENING REALLY FAST. BUT THE FASHION WORLD IS WORLD. DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, DOES IT AFFECT YOU SO MUCH? I SUPPOSE IT DOES, I MEAN, THERE’S A LOT TO REACT TO. IT’S KINDA GREAT ACTUALLY, THERE’S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO LOOK AT. I LIKE TO DO STUFF A DIFFERENT WAY, AND THERE’S SPACE FOR A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION AND THERE’S GOT TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO LOOK AT THIS. AND IF I’M LOOKING FOR IT, I’M NOT THAT UNIQUE, THERE’S A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME. I READ IN A VOGUE RUNWAY REVIEW THAT YOU’VE HAD THE ‘HUMAN DECLINE’ ON YOUR MIND THE LAST FEW SEASONS. ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BOOKS IS BY AN SCI-FI NOVELIST AND PHILOSOPHER CALLED OLAF STAPLEDON. HE WROTE A BOOK CALLED ‘STARMAKER’ THAT PROPOSES THAT INTELLIGENT EXISTENCE WILL FOREVER HIT A DISAPPOINTING PEAK BEFORE DEGRADING BACK ON ITSELF AGAIN, BEATEN DOWN BY AN INDIFFERENT UNIVERSE, AND THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, FAIL TO COMPREHEND OR REALISE THEIR OWN LOFTY YEARNINGS. AND SO HUMANITY RISES AND FALLS, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. WITH THIS IDEA IN MIND, ARE WE TODAY STILL WAITING TO HIT OUR PEAK OR ARE WE ALREADY IN THE DEGRADATION PHASE? LOFTY YEARNINGS ARE USUALLY PRETTY IDEALISTIC AND UNATTAINABLE. AS INDIVIDUALS, BEING SATISFIED BY HITTING REALISTIC PEAKS IS TOTALLY DOABLE. LIFE DOESN’T HAVE TO BE SO DRAMATIC. I’M NOT REALLY SURE I BELIEVE IN ECOLOGICAL DECLINE. WE SEE CHANGES HAPPENING AND SOME DOORS CLOSING BUT I THINK THESE CHANGES ARE INEVITABLE AND SOME OTHER PORTALS START TO OPEN. I WAS MAINLY TALKING ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE THREATS – MORTAL OR ECOLOGICAL. HOW CAN WE NEGOTIATE TRANSITION IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND GRACEFUL WAY? CAN YOU THINK BACK TO YOUR EARLIEST MEMORY – WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HOLD ON TO THAT? I REMEMBER LYING ALONE IN A FIELD FEELING PERFECTLY SERENE SURROUNDED BY WET HIGH GREEN GRASS. I SMELLED WET EARTH AND FELT THE DAMPNESS PENETRATING MY CLOTHES AND REACHING MY SKIN AS IF I COULD START MELTING INTO THE DIRT MYSELF. IT WAS VERY REASSURING AND I RECREATE THAT SCENARIO WHENEVER I CAN. A CLOSED FIST IS A SYMBOL OF POWER, AGGRESSION, ANGER. CONTROL TOO. IT’S ALSO PART OF THE CONCEPT OF GRIPPING TIGHTLY TO SOMETHING. WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR YOU TO LET SOMETHING GO? I’M PRETTY GOOD AT LETTING THINGS GO. I DON’T LIKE A LOT OF COMPLICATION, CHAOS OR CLUTTER SO THE LESS I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BETTER. YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED HOW SIMPLE MY LIFE IS. CAN YOU TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT OF CONTROL? ARE YOU SELF CONTROLLED? I’M VERY SELF CONTROLLED BUT THAT’S JUST A PERSONAL PRIORITY. I DON’T THINK ITS A BETTER WAY TO LIVE THAN OTHER PEOPLE, IT’S JUST A CHOICE I MADE. AND I AM PERFECTLY AWARE THAT IT IS A FANTASY. A COMMITTED JUNKIE HAS AS MUCH VALUE IN HIS CHOICE. CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR ﬁRST THOUGHTS IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP? DO YOU HAVE ANY RITUALS? MY FIRST THOUGHT IS USUALLY GRATITUDE, BECAUSE MY LIFE IS NICER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. MY SECOND IS ANTICIPATION ON WHAT NEW DEVELOPMENTS WILL PRESENT THEMSELVES AND MY THIRD IS A SELF DOUBTING WEAKNESS, WONDERING HOW I MIGHT F CK IT ALL UP. HAS YOUR PROCESS CHANGED MUCH FROM WHEN YOU STARTED? ARE YOU A DIGITAL OR ANALOGUE PERSON NOW? DO YOU DRAW FOR PLEASURE, EVER? DO YOU STILL GET YOUR HANDS VERY DIRTY? I NEVER REALLY DREW – I ALWAYS DRAPED AND I DRAPE AS MUCH AS I EVER DID. I JUST DON’T TRANSLATE MY DRAPING TO PAPER PATTERNS LIKE I DID AT THE BEGINNING. BUT I AM AT THE FACTORY HALF THE YEAR GOING THROUGH THE FABRIC ROLLS AND CUTTING AND PINNING AND DISCARDING AND STARTING OVER. WHAT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY PLEASURABLE AND PAINFUL TO YOU? GAUGING WHAT I CAN GET DONE BEFORE THE NEXT DEADLINE. BUT I DON’T FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF FEELING PRESSURED. I FIND THE CYCLE STIMULATING. HANDS VERY MUCH DEAL GIVE BOTH PLEASURE AND PAIN, AND TOUCH CONVEYS SO MUCH. ARE YOU A HUGGER? I AM A HUGGER. I TRY NOT TO IMPOSE MYSELF TOO MUCH, NOT EVERYBODY REALLY ENJOYS BEING HUGGED. BUT I DON’T REALLY SEE HOW ANYBODY COULD BE OFFENDED BY A SHOULDER SQUEEZE OR BRIEF PAT ON THE FOREARM. ARE YOU A VERY TACTILE PERSON? WHAT DO YOU FIND PLEASURABLE TO TOUCH? OH MY GOD, DON’T GET ME STARTED. THE THROAT OF A WILD FOXGLOVE, WET CLAY, SWANSDOWN, MONEY... WHAT IS A DIRTY WORD TO YOU? I DON’T LIKE BEING TOLD NO.

TOO MANY COMPUTER CHAIR ACTIVISTS, TERRIFIED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THEY AIR AN OPINION THEY HOLD IN REAL LIFE. TOO MANY PEOPLE AFRAID TO GO OUT AND JUST DO IT. NOT CHRISTEENE. NO, THE SELF-PROFESSED “DRAG TERRORIST” WIELDS 10-INCH DILDO GUNS AND IF YOU’RE NOT A FAN, THEN YOU CAN KINDLY “F CK OFF”, IN HER WORDS. BUT HERE’S WHY YOU SHOULD BE A FAN: SHE’S OUR GENERATION’S DIVINE. HER UNAPOLOGETIC TRANSGRESSIONS AND OUTRAGEOUS MUSIC ARE WHAT’S REQUIRED TO WAKE US UP TO BATTLE THE HORRORS AND INJUSTICES THAT WE NOW FACE. SHE’S AN ADVOCATE OF VULNERABILITY, BECAUSE WE’RE TOO ASHAMED TO OWN OUR FEELINGS, HOWEVER ALIEN THEY MAY SEEM. SHE’S A SEXUAL PIONEER, UNASHAMEDLY CARNAL IN HER SIGNATURE LOOK – SMEARED LIPSTICK AND A DISHEVELLED WIG. (CLOTHING VERY MUCH OPTIONAL). ASK CHRISTEENE ABOUT HER ORIGIN STORY AND YOU’LL LIKELY GET A FABLE ABOUT HOW SHE WAS YANKED OUT OF SOME TRASH BIN AS AN INFANT IN HER HOMETOWN OF AUSTIN, TEXAS. SHE’S NOW “APPROACHING NINE YEARS OLD.” REAL NAME PAUL SOILEAU, CHRISTEENE IS A PROVOCATIVE INVENTION OF THE HIGHEST ORDER, CREATED TO UNLEASH THE AGGRESSIVE SENTIMENTS BOTTLED UP INSIDE A QUEER, SOUTHERN BOY. SOILEAU GREW UP IN LOUISIANA AND LEFT FOR TEXAS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA. THAT’S WHEN CHRISTEENE CAME TO LIFE. WITH A CAREER ARC THAT MIRRORS LITERALLY NO ONE, SHE DRAWS IRE FOR HER LOW-BUDGET VISUALS THAT DOUBLE AS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL COMMENTARY. WATCH ANY OF HER VIDEOS – “FIX MY D CK”, “AFRICAN MAYONNAISE” – AND YOU’LL GET A SENSE OF WHAT I MEAN. CHRISTEENE IS A TRUE VISIONARY, WHICH IS WHY SHE’S TEAMED UP WITH DIRECTOR MATT LAMBERT AND RICK OWENS FOR HER LATEST VISUAL ASSAULT, “BUTT MUSCLE”. IT’S SO NSFW WE’VE HAD TO BLUR OUT SOME PARTS. SHE SHOVES OWENS’ WAIST-LENGTH HAIR INTO HER A SHOLE. SHE PISSES IN HIS MOUTH (NO RELATION, I’M TOLD, TO TRUMP’S #GOLDENSHOWERS). CHRISTEENE AND OWENS’ PARTNER MICHÈLE LAMY SHARE A LUBED-UP, OPEN-MOUTHED KISS. AND IT’S ALL IN THE NAME OF LAYING BARE THE INHERENT SHAME AND GUILT OF BEING OPENLY SEXUAL, ESPECIALLY AS A QUEER PERSON. WE’RE CENSORED FOR IT, VILIFIED AND DISMISSED BY YOUTUBE, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC. CHRISTEENE MAY SHOCK, BUT HER REAL MESSAGE IS ONE OF JOY AND LOVE. IT’S A MESSAGE SHARED BY HER COLLABORATORS RICK OWENS AND MATT LAMBERT, WHO JOIN HER HERE IN CONVERSATION, DISCUSSING SEXUALITY, VULNERABILITY AND CENSORSHIP. AND IF YOU DON’T GET IT? IT’S NOT FOR YOU. “I DON&#39;T CARE WHAT THEY THINK,” SHE SAYS, SHRUGGING OFF HER DETRACTORS. “I HAD FUN.” CHRISTEENE, WHAT’S THE SECRET TO BEING SO UNAPOLOGETICALLY, OPENLY SEXUAL AND TRANSGRESSIVE? CHRISTEENE: I THINK IT’S BEING VULNERABLE. AND ALLOWING YOURSELF TO DROP THOSE GODDAMN IMAGES THAT WE’VE SEEN ON WHAT IS SEXUAL, WHAT IS TRANSGRESSIVE S IT AND YOUR OWN VULNERABILITY MIXED WITH YOUR FAMILY AND WHATEVER KIND OF F CKING SEXUALITY THAT YOU HAVE. NO ONE HAS THE SAME KIND OF SEXUALITY. EVERYONE’S GOT THEIR STRANGE TASTES INSIDE THEIR MOUTHS AND THEIR BRAINS, SO IF YOU ALLOW YOURSELF THE VULNERABILITY TO RELEASE THOSE THINGS, THAT’S ALL THE S IT YOU NEED TO GET OUT THERE. JUST FIND THE RIGHT PLATFORM AND FAMILY TO DO IT. WHY DO YOU THINK THERE’S SUCH AN INHERENT SHAME PLACED AROUND SEXUALITY? CHRISTEENE: A SHAME? BECAUSE I LIVE IN AMERICA. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? CHRISTEENE: THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO AND… MATT LAMBERT: SEXUALITY IS BEING VULNERABLE, RIGHT? BEING HONEST WITH WHAT YOU’RE SEXUALLY INTO IS VULNERABLE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLY AFRAID TO BE VULNERABLE, EVER, IN THEIR LIVES. PEOPLE LIKE CHRISTEENE AND RICK, AND I TRY AS WELL, THAT VULNERABILITY IS A PART OF THE STRENGTH OF OURSELVES AS ARTISTS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED OF THAT. I THINK REVEALING THAT SEXUALITY AS TRUTH IS REALLY SCARY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. CHRISTEENE: BUT IT’S ALSO FUN. AND WHEN WE SEE “BUTT MUSCLE”, WHERE PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME – F CK THE SCARY, AND F CK THE FEAR AND VULNERABILITY AND START TO TAP INTO THE ENJOYMENT OF IT AND THE EXHILARATION OF IT AND THE FREEDOM OF IT. MATT LAMBERT: AND NOT JUST THE SEXUALITY ITSELF, BUT THE SEXUAL BEINGS THAT WE PLAYED WITH ARE THINGS THAT, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, WOULD FEEL TABOO. TO TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND HAVE FUN WITH THEM AND PLAY WITH THEM AND USE COMEDY, HOPEFULLY DEMYSTIFIES THOSE THINGS A LITTLE BIT FOR MORE PEOPLE. HUMANISES THOSE THINGS A LITTLE BIT FOR PEOPLE. I HOPE. IS THERE A RIGHT REACTION TO ANY OF YOUR MUSIC OR VIDEOS? CHRISTEENE: NO. AS LONG AS THERE’S A REACTION. IF THERE WAS NO REACTION, THEN F CK THAT. SO LONG AS I GET SOMETHING. RICK OWENS: I HOPE SOMEONE’S GOING TO SAY, “OH, THEY SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THAT.” CHRISTEENE: OR “BLESS THEIR HEARTS.” MATT LAMBERT: WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOM’S GONNA SAY. SHE’LL SAY, “WELL, AS LONG AS NOBODY GOT HURT.” LIKE ASHLEY (RYDER) ALMOST THREW HIS BACK OUT FISTING HIMSELF. CHRISTEENE: HE DID. SO SOMEONE DID KINDA GET HURT. MY EMOTIONS WERE HURT SEVERAL TIMES. NOW THAT TRUMP IS IN OFFICE, WILL YOU MAKE ANY CHANGE TO WHAT YOU ARE ALREADY DOING? RICK OWENS: OH ABSOLUTELY, I’M GOING TO GO HARDER AND STRONGER. YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD. IT’S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP THAT BALANCE. MATT LAMBERT: I FORGET THE QUOTE BUT CHRISTEENE HAD A GREAT TWEET RIGHT AFTER TRUMP WON THAT WAS BASICALLY THAT. IT WAS ABOUT GOING HARDER. BUCK THE F CK UP, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING, DO IT TWICE AS HARD. CHRISTEENE: ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DIED LAST YEAR, ALL THESE FAGS AND ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO BUILD US UP, I WAS LIKE BUCK UP, GET YOUR S IT TOGETHER. THE WELL OF SOULS IS FULL. TAP INTO THIS WELL OF SOULS THAT WE HAVE AND START TO HARVEST THAT S IT AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A GORGEOUS STRENGTH. I DON’T LIKE TO USE ALL THOSE GODDAMN ARMY TERMS LIKE “AN ARMY OF” OR “FIGHT THIS”, LIKE F CK THAT, BUT I TAP INTO SOME SPIRITUAL STRENGTH AND SOME FRICKING ANAL AURA, AS MY DANCER SILKY WOULD SAY, THAT WILL TAKE YOU OVER AND START TO USE THOSE MAGICAL WEAPONS. RICK OWENS: (TO CHRISTEENE) I LOVE IT WHEN YOU START TESTIFYING. MATT LAMBERT: A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE WORK THAT SPEAKS TO WHAT’S GOING ON, ESPECIALLY TO THAT CONSERVATIVE ENERGY IN AMERICA, AND NOW IT FEELS LIKE, “LET’S F CKING DO IT NOW!” NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT. IF PEOPLE WERE SITTING ON THEIR ASS THINKING, I SHOULD MAKE WORK THAT’S MORE POLITICAL, OR MORE ENGAGED, OR SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS, NOW THERE’S A BIT OF FIRE UNDER THEIR ASS TO DO IT. CHRISTEENE: WE HAVE BEEN PROVOKED. WE ARE LIKE FIRE ANTS. SOMEONE STEPPED ON OUR PILE REALLY HEAVILY. IF THIS WAS FUNDED BY A LABEL, WHAT WOULD THAT LIMIT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU COULD DO IN THE VIDEO? RICK OWENS: WELL, THAT’S THE BIG MESSAGE HERE IN A WAY. THE FACT THAT I’M INDEPENDENT MEANS THAT WE GET TO DO S IT LIKE THIS. WE CAN DO WHATEVER THE F CK WE WANT. AND I WANT TO EMPHASISE THAT AND CELEBRATE IT. WE GET TO DO ANYTHING WE WANT. AND BEING INDEPENDENT IS A RARITY NOW, ISN&#39;T IT? SO THIS IS A WAY TO REALLY— CHRISTEENE: CELEBRATE IT? RICK OWENS: CELEBRATE IT. I WAS GONNA SAY TELL THAT MESSAGE, BUT TELLING A MESSAGE SOUNDS A LITTLE PREACHY AND I DON’T WANT TO DO THAT. BUT YEAH, CELEBRATE IT, THAT’S THE BEST WAY OF PUTTING IT. MATT LAMBERT: I’VE WORKED WITH A LOT OF RECORD LABELS MYSELF AS WELL. IF YOU’RE DOING VIDEOS FOR PEANUTS YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH A LOT. BUT WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO AMERICAN LABELS AND DEAL WITH THEIR VOICES, AND THE FEAR THAT THEY HAVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUALITY AND RELATIONSHIPS, QUEER BODIES. YOU CAN DEFINITELY HAVE GREASED UP TITTIES AND ASSES EVERYWHERE IN A HIP HOP VIDEO BUT AS SOON AS YOU START GETTING INTO QUEER SPACES IT BECOMES SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DON’T WANT TO TOUCH. SO I DEAL WITH THAT WITH EVERY PROJECT THAT I DO. IT’S ALWAYS A CONVERSATION, WHETHER IT’S HOW WE CENSOR FOR A PREMIERE OR WHAT THE LABEL HAS TO SAY ABOUT A VIDEO. SO THIS WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS AND JUST DO OUR THING. CHRISTEENE: FROM WHERE I’M COMING FROM, I NEVER HAVE DEALT WITH LABELS OR ANY KIND OF PROPER MANAGEMENT REALLY, SO THIS WAS A NATURAL AVENUE THAT MY HOLE NEEDED TO TAKE, BECAUSE IT WAS FREEDOM TO DO WHAT WE WANTED AND IT WAS FAMILY DOING IT. WHEN YOU WORK WITH FAMILY AND YOU’RE VULNERABLE WITH THEM YOU CAN BE FREE AND SAY, “F CK YOU!” TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE’RE NOT GONNA PUT SOME REGULATIONS ON THIS S IT. IT SEEMED LIKE THE MOST NATURAL ROOM FOR ME TO WALK INTO. RICK OWENS: IT IS SUCH A CULTURAL PIECE. CULTURALLY, THE WORLD IS SO SAFE AND SO FLAT RIGHT NOW AND WE NEED TO BALANCE THAT OUT. WE NEED TO OFFER OUR LITTLE CONTRIBUTION TO BALANCE THAT. HOW DO YOU COMBAT THAT SAFENESS? RICK OWENS: I JUST MEANT THERE’S A CONSERVATIVE ELEMENT IN THE WORLD WHERE STANDARDS OF BEAUTY ARE VERY CLICHÉ. WE’RE SUGGESTING OTHER STANDARDS OF BEAUTY AND OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT BE SO CLICHÉ. MATT LAMBERT: AND OTHER STANDARDS OF INTIMACY AND OTHER STANDARDS OF SEXUALITY. RICK OWENS: AND JOY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT VIDEO, MAKING A VIDEO IS SO LOVING AND SWEET AND JOYFUL. THERE’S A GLITTER ROCK FEELING TO IT. IN TERMS OF TRANSGRESSION AND THE JUBILANCE TO IT. MATT LAMBERT: I GUESS THAT WAS THE IDEA. TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT WAS TRANSGRESSIVE BUT TO DO IT WITH HUMOUR AND TO DO IT WITH LOVE, TO DO IT WITH A HUMANIST APPROACH, BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE DEFINITELY TAKEN SOME OF THOSE MOMENTS AND HAVE IT DONE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF SHOCKING. IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE CHARACTERS AS PEOPLE, THAT THERE WERE REAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND THERE REALLY WERE. CHRISTEENE: YEAH. IF YOU SEE US LAUGHING IN THE VIDEO, WE WERE F CKING LAUGHING. AND IF YOU SEE HOLDING UP A GUN WITH 10-INCH BLACK DILDO ON IT, AND I LOOK LIKE I&#39;M GONNA DIE IN SHOCK, THAT’S REALITY. RICK OWENS: AND WHEN YOU SEE HIM CHOKING ON MY HAIR, IT’S REALLY HAPPENING. CHRISTEENE: I AM CHOKING ON IT. AND WHEN YOU SEE RICK TRYING TO MOVE RHYTHMICALLY TO MUSIC, THAT’S REALLY HAPPENING TOO. GOD BLESS EDITING. WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO PEE INTO RICK’S MOUTH? CHRISTEENE: THAT WAS RICK’S IDEA. I WANTED TO PUT HIS HAIR UP MY BUTTHOLE AND THEN COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH AND THEN HE WAS LIKE, “HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU PEE ON ME?” AND I SAID YES. MATT LAMBERT: I PITCHED TO RICK THAT WE WANTED TO DO SOME ASS PLAY AND HE WASN’T SO INTO IT, SO HE COUNTERED WITH ANOTHER SUGGESTION, WHICH WAS A LITTLE SKETCH. I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY ROMANTIC ABOUT IT. HE WAS EXCHANGING INTIMACY AND FLUIDS WITH HIS PARTNER AND CHRISTEENE WAS THE CONDUIT AND THE VESSEL THAT TRANSFERS THE ENERGY BETWEEN THEM. SO THE WAY WE TALKED ABOUT IT WAS THIS BEAUTIFUL, INTIMATE DISCUSSION OF HOW TO GET TO THAT POINT. IT’S A BIT COMICAL FOR SURE, BUT I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING REALLY F CKING TENDER AND BEAUTIFUL AND HUMAN ABOUT THAT SCENE. CHRISTEENE: LIKE WE SAID, THE VIDEO REPRESENTS A LOT OF PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER. AND WHENEVER I’VE MET THESE TWO PEOPLE WE SHARED EACH OTHER’S TRUST AND LOVE, SO IN THAT ONE PARTICULAR SCENE I’VE GOT MICHÈLE HOOKED UP TO MY MOUTH AND I’VE GOT MY PEE GOING INTO RICK’S MOUTH AND IT’S A BEAUTIFUL CONNECTION AND RIVER OF LOVE. TO WHAT EXTENT CAN YOU USE YOUR RESPECTIVE ARTS TO PROTEST? HOW FAR CAN YOU GO THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE? CHRISTEENE: I DON’T SEE IT AS GAUGING HOW FAR I CAN GO, LIKE A METRE, OR HITTING THE PIG WITH A HAMMER AND SEEING HOW HIGH THE BELL CAN GO. I THINK IT’S JUST HOW MUCH MORE VULNERABLE CAN I GET. I LOOK AT IT SINGULARLY AS CREATORS, AS CREATIVE PEOPLE, HOW WE SINGULARLY LOOK AT TAKING DOWN THIS MANIAC AND HIS REGIME BUT ALSO YOU START TO HUNT AND YOU CONNECT WITH MORE OF THOSE PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT’S HOW FAR I WANT TO GO PERSONALLY. HOW CAN I REACH MORE OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO CREATE AND DO THE SAME THINGS? RICK OWENS: IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT GOING FAR; IT’S ABOUT CONTRIBUTION. HOW CAN WE CONTRIBUTE TO MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE, AND SAFER FOR PEOPLE LIKE US? DO YOU THRIVE ON THE REACTIONS TO YOUR WORK? CHRISTEENE: WELL, IT’S BEAUTIFUL TO DO LIVE SHOWS ESPECIALLY. I HEAR LOTS OF WONDERFUL THINGS FROM LITTLE FAGS AND DYKES AND TRANNIES AND F CKING CREATURES I’VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THAT LIVE DEEP, DEEP IN THE OCEAN AND IT’S THE MOST INSPIRING, OH IT’S MUSIC. IT’S BETTER MUSIC THAN ANY ARTIST I EVER HEARD OUT THERE WHEN IT COMES FROM THOSE KIDS MOUTHS AND HEARTS. IT’S THE BEST. IT’S THE ONLY REASON I KEEP DOING IT.

IT’S ABOUT TOLERANCE, KINDNESS AND BALANCING OUT WHAT THE DESIGNER SEES AS RISING BIGOTRY AND CRUELTY IN SOCIETY. AT A PARTY DURING THE MOST RECENT MEN’S FASHION WEEK IN PARIS, OWENS AND VALE PREMIERED THE VIDEO, TITLED “BUTT MUSCLE,” WHICH OPENS WITH A SCENE DEPICTING VALE RELIEVING HIMSELF ON THE DESIGNER—- AND THEN GLEEFULLY EXALTS ALMOST EVERY X-RATED FETISH IN THE BOOK. DRAG ARTISTS, DANCERS AND TWO LIVE HORSES WERE AMONG THE GUESTS AT A PARTY THAT RAGED UNTIL 6 A.M. AT A CLANDESTINE CLUB UNDER THE CITY’S RING ROAD. “THERE’S A CLIMATE RIGHT NOW THAT IS GOING IN A DIRECTION I’M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH, AND I FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO BALANCE THAT OUT,” OWENS TOLD WWD IN AN INTERVIEW AT HIS PARIS HEADQUARTERS. “IF WE HAVE EXTREME SELF-RIGHTEOUS BIGOTRY ON ONE SIDE, THEN WE NEED TO BALANCE THAT OUT WITH SOME CHEERFUL DEGENERACY ON THE OTHER.” FOR OWENS, THE “UNDERGROUND” MAY NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE, BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COUNTER-CULTURE IS RISING. “SOMETIMES THERE ARE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CLIMATES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO REACT AGAINST AND THIS COULD BE ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS — IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS,” HE SAID. FETISHES HAVE LONG BEEN A MOTIF IN RICK OWENS’ WORK. A STATUE HE DISPLAYED AT PITTI UOMO IN 2011 SHOWED HIM PEEING ONTO MIRRORS. THE DESIGNER LIKES TO ASK WHY CERTAIN THEMES — NOTABLY SEXUAL ONES — ARE STILL SEEN AS PERVERSE WHILE VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY ARE SO BROADLY ACCEPTED. “IT’S FINE FOR MOVIES TO DEPICT PEOPLE BEING RIPPED APART BY BULLETS TO A HEAVY METAL SOUNDTRACK, BUT A LITTLE BIT OF PISS DRINKING AND PEOPLE GET ALL NERVOUS…AND YET WE’RE FINE WITH A HOT, HALF-NAKED GUY NAILED TO A CROSS DYING,” SAID OWENS. THE DESIGNER WAS EDUCATED IN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS, WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HIS NEED TO REBEL AGAINST CONTROL, BUT ALSO APPRECIATION FOR CEREMONY AND RITUAL — FREQUENT THEMES IN HIS FASHION WORK. “I’M THINKING IN MYTHICAL, ALLEGORICAL TERMS AND PEOPLE TAKE IT VERY LITERALLY. EVEN ON MY INSTAGRAM, I’M SURPRISED AT HOW STRAIGHT PEOPLE ARE BEING [ABOUT THE VIDEO]. PEOPLE ARE SAYING I CAN’T TAKE THIS, I’M GOING TO UNFOLLOW,” OWENS SAID. “DID THEY NOT TEACH THIS GENERATION ABOUT CUBISM, ABOUT SURREALISM, ABOUT DADAISM? BECAUSE IT CAN BE SO LITERAL AND KIND OF STRAIGHT. WE’VE HAD THESE MOVEMENTS BEFORE THAT WERE SO ADVENTUROUS, AND THIS IS WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH?” IN TERMS OF FASHION, OWENS ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HIS OWN TASTES TREND TOWARD THE EXTREME — IN 2015 THE DESIGNER SHOWED MEN’S CLOAKS WITH PORTHOLES ONTO PRIVATE PARTS — BUT POINTS OUT THAT MOVEMENTS LIKE NORMCORE ARE TRANSGRESSIVE IN THEIR OWN WAY. “NORMCORE IS ICKY AND KIND OF DISTURBING…BECAUSE IT’S NOT TRYING. IT’S REJECTING,” OWENS SAID. “THERE’S A SNEERING SIDE TO NORMCORE WHERE I CAN SEE ITS APPEAL…BUT IT’S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME. “I’M NOT A LUXURY COMPANY. I DON’T HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THAT WAY,” OWENS SAID. “I’M A NICHE COMPANY, AND I GET TO PERFORM A SOLILOQUY OF MY PERSONAL INTERESTS. BEING INDEPENDENT IS COMPLETELY RARE NOW.” OWENS SAID THE VIDEO WAS PARTLY ABOUT HAVING FUN WITH FRIENDS. HE NOTED HE AND HIS WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER MICHELE LAMY HAD A “RIDICULOUS BONDING EXPERIENCE” SHOOTING THE VIDEO WITH VALE AND DIRECTOR MATT LAMBERT—AND GAINED GREATER SELF-AWARENESS. BUT IT’S ALSO ABOUT MAKING USE OF HIS PLATFORM’S INDEPENDENCE. ABOUT THE MORE GRAPHIC SEXUAL ACTS DEPICTED IN THE VIDEO, “IT’S KIND OF LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE FROM ANOTHER PLANET DO THINGS THEIR WAY. AND THERE’S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR AN ATTITUDE FOR TOLERANCE FOR THAT,” OWENS SAID. “PUTTING OUT POSITIVE ENERGY IS AN OPPORTUNITY I HAVE THAT I DON’T WANT TO WASTE…SURE, IT HAS SHOCK VALUE — AND SHOCK VALUE IS FUN — BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT’S ABOUT KINDNESS AND SELF-AWARENESS AND TOLERANCE. “AND THEN,” HE ADDED, “THERE’S THE FACT THAT GOOD-NATURED DEPRAVITY IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT FUN.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

IT’S WHAT THE EMBODIMENT OF HIS CLOTHES SHOULD BE, IF WE WERE GOING BY SOME UNWRITTEN AESTHETIC SCRIPT. AFTER ALL, THE FASHION OWENS PRESENTS FOUR TIMES A YEAR, FOR MEN AND WOMEN, ON THE GRAND PARIS STAGE, ISN’T FREE AND EASY. IT ISN’T SIMPLE. IT OFTEN LOOKS LIKE RAGS: PRECIOUS FABRICS, LIKE CASHMERE, ARE PILLED AND LADDERED, AND LEATHER IS REPEATEDLY WASHED TO GIVE IT THE TEXTURE AND APPEARANCE OF A PREHISTORIC ANIMAL’S SKIN. THERE IS SOMETHING MONSTROUS ABOUT HIS GOTHIC GARMENTS, WITH THEIR STRANGE, DISTURBING PROPORTIONS ATTENUATED AND EXAGGERATED, DRAPED LIKE ECTOPLASM CLINGING TO THIN LIMBS. WHEN PEOPLE WEAR THEM HEAD TO TOE, AS OWENS’S MOST ENTHUSIASTIC FOLLOWERS FREQUENTLY DO, THEY DON’T LOOK HUMAN. THEY LOOK OTHER. “TROLL CLOTHES FOR THE MOST DESPERATE LEMMINGS IN THE FASHION HERD,” ONE OBSERVER WROTE IN 2008 ON THE NEW YORK TIMES’S ON THE RUNWAY BLOG. OWENS APPRECIATED THE SENTIMENT SO MUCH THAT HE RAN THE PHRASE ON HIS WEBSITE, ALONGSIDE NEAR-UNIVERSAL PLAUDITS FROM THE REST OF THE FASHION WORLD. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A DISCONNECT BETWEEN RICK OWENS THE MAN AND RICK OWENS THE FASHION DESIGNER. IN PHOTOGRAPHS, OWENS LOOKS ARRESTING, EVEN SINISTER, WITH HIS POKER-STRAIGHT BLACK HAIR AND SHROUDLIKE ATTIRE, LIKE THE GRIM REAPER CROSSED WITH A WEST COAST SURF BUM. (HE OFTEN WEARS DIAPER-WRAP SHORTS AND SNEAKERS, WHICH UNDERMINES THE GOTH UNDERTONES.) HIS SPIKY, SHARPLY DRAWN FEATURES APPEAR A LITTLE CADAVEROUS. PRESENTED IN PRINT, OWENS — GENERALLY QUOTED ON TOPICS SUCH AS DEATH, RENEWAL, CREATION — CAN COME ACROSS LIKE A PROPHET OF THE APOCALYPSE. AND THOSE MONSTROUS “TROLL CLOTHES” HE DESIGNS OFTEN SEEM, AT FIRST GLANCE, COLD AND HARD, SOLID CARAPACES OF FABRIC, SHARPLY CUT AND DIFFICULT TO WEAR. “I MISS ARCHNESS,” HE MURMURS, AS IF BY WAY OF EXPLANATION. “I THINK THERE WAS AN ARCH MOMENT IN THE ’40S IN FASHION, AND I’M THINKING FORWARD, THINKING ABOUT FASHION CYCLES — THAT’S KIND OF A GOOD CYCLE TO BRING BACK.” BUT THERE’S SOMETHING UNEXPECTEDLY SOFT ABOUT OWENS, BOTH THE MAN AND HIS CLOTHES. IN PERSON, HE’S PRETERNATURALLY TANNED (HE HOLIDAYS IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, “THE SHORTEST FLIGHT TO THE MOST SUN”), AND HIS VOICE, A LANGUID CALIFORNIAN DRAWL, REDOLENT OF THE STATE WHERE HE LIVED UNTIL THE AGE OF 42, SOFTENS HIS DOOMSDAY PORTENTS. IT ADDS BOTH A HUMANITY AND A NOTE OF WRY HUMOR THAT COLLAPSES ANY PERCEIVED PRETENSION. AND IN PERSON, THOSE CLOTHES COLLAPSE TOO, IN ON THEMSELVES, SOFTLY WRAPPING THE BODY IN PROTECTIVE LAYERS OF FELTED FABRIC AND DOWN PADDING. UP CLOSE, HIS ARCH SILHOUETTES PROVE LIGHT AND PLIABLE TO THE TOUCH, SEDUCTIVE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, THE COUTURIER CRISTÓBAL BALENCIAGA WAS FIRST APPLAUDED, THEN DEIFIED BY THE FASHION PRESS FOR ACHIEVING THE SELFSAME, AND HIS APPROACH INFLUENCED AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF DESIGNERS. OWENS’S TECHNIQUE HAS STEALTHILY PROVED JUST AS INFLUENTIAL. BALENCIAGA PROBABLY DIDN’T COMPARE AN ESPECIALLY VISCERAL BUNCH OF DRAPERY TO ANAL PROLAPSE, AS OWENS HAS. BUT THEN HE ALSO, TO MY KNOWLEDGE, DIDN’T CONFESS TO AN INTERVIEWER THAT HE DYES HIS OWN HAIR. “I’M THINKING I BETTER SHUT UP NOW,” OWENS SAYS, ALMOST AS AN ASIDE. THE DELIVERY IS SO DEADPAN IT BEGS FOR A PUNCH LINE. “IS IT POSSIBLE FOR DESIGNERS TO TALK TOO MUCH, DO YOU THINK?” HE SMILES, BUT THANKFULLY DOESN’T STOP TALKING. OWENS IS 55, AND WAS BORN IN PORTERVILLE, CALIF., A SMALL CITY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. HE MOVED TO LOS ANGELES AFTER GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL, ORIGINALLY STUDYING FINE ART AT THE OTIS ART INSTITUTE OF PARSONS SCHOOL OF DESIGN, THEN DROPPING OUT AFTER TWO YEARS. “I WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST AT THE BEGINNING,” HE SAYS. “BUT THEN I DIDN’T THINK I HAD IT IN ME. I DIDN’T THINK I HAD THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA FOR IT, SO I DECIDED TO BE A FASHION DESIGNER, BECAUSE THAT WAS FRIVOLOUS AND EASY.” OWENS SMILES WIDER. HE IS, AGAIN, DEFLATING THE MYTH THAT HAS GROWN AROUND HIM. HE DOESN’T TAKE HIMSELF AS SERIOUSLY AS HIS WORK WOULD LEAD PEOPLE TO BELIEVE. UNLIKE MANY FASHION DESIGNERS, HOWEVER, OWENS IS ABLE TO ARTICULATE, PRECISELY AND VIVIDLY, WHAT HE’S TRYING TO DO WITH HIS CLOTHES, NAMELY TALK ABOUT THOSE BIG, OVERARCHING THEMES AFFECTING HUMANITY, AND OFFER SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE FASHION LANDSCAPE. WHEN HE TALKS, HE MAKES YOU TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. AND HE LIKES TO TALK. WE MEET IN PARIS TO DISCUSS HIS MEN’S WEAR WHICH, PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO THAN HIS WOMEN’S WEAR, IS REVOLUTIONARY, AND HAS PROVED GROUNDBREAKING IN ITS INFLUENCE. IN A SOUPY SEA OF MEDIOCRE SUITING AND SPORTSWEAR, HE OFFERS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER DESIGNERS. HE BOLDLY EXPERIMENTS WITH FABRIC AND SILHOUETTE, PUSHING BOUNDARIES OF SEXUALITY AND GENDER. OWENS IS AS LIKELY TO PROPOSE A DRESS FOR A MAN AS FOR A WOMAN, BUT WITHOUT SACRIFICING MANLINESS IN FAVOR OF RUNWAY NOVELTY. “MY STUFF SEEMS TO ATTRACT GUYS THAT I THINK MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES SOME KIND OF HEROIC LONE WOLF, KIND OF PLAYING BY THEIR OWN MORAL CODES,” OWENS SAYS, SLOWLY. “I WAS THINKING ABOUT MEN’S FASHION, I WAS THINKING IN THE ’80S CALVIN KLEIN, HE PROMOTED MALE SEXUALITY ... MALES AS AN OBJECT OF SEXUAL ATTENTION. THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED THEN, AND THEN IN THE ’90S MEN’S FASHION WAS A REACTION TO THAT AND IT BECAME ABOUT YOUTH. IT BECAME SKINNY AND SLIM AND YOUNG AND INTROSPECTIVE AND VULNERABLE. NOW, WHAT IS NOW?” HE STOPS. “IF THE LAST CYCLE WAS VULNERABILITY, THE OBVIOUS REACTION WOULD BE HEROISM.” HEROISM FOR OWENS ISN’T ABOUT THE BARREL-CHESTED JACKET OR THIGH-GRIPPING PANTS. IT ISN’T ABOUT ANY CLICHÉ OF DRESSING. OWENS HAS CREATED COLLECTIONS INSPIRED BY NIJINSKY’S PERFORMANCE IN “AFTERNOON OF A FAUN,” AND BY THE ATHLETIC SILHOUETTE OF FRED ASTAIRE. IN BOTH HE USED DRAPERY INSTEAD OF TAILORING, GARMENTS TWISTED AND CAPTURED IN MOTION, SEEMINGLY FROZEN IN FRENZIED, BALLETIC MOVEMENT. HE ALSO JOKINGLY STATED A COLLECTION WAS INSPIRED BY “TOPS” AND “BOTTOMS” — NOT THE GARMENTS, BUT RATHER THE WORDS DENOTING SEXUAL PREFERENCE IN THE GAY VERNACULAR. (OWENS IS BISEXUAL.) FOR SPRING, OWENS PRODUCED A REMARKABLE COLLECTION, PUMPED WITH EYE-SOCKING COLORS OF PUTTY PINK, PEPPERMINT AND SULFURIC YELLOW. BUT IT WAS THE SILHOUETTE THAT MADE THE STRONGEST IMPACT: JACKETS ABBREVIATED HIGH ON THE TORSO, PANTS BILLOWING ORGANICALLY AROUND THE LEG, LIKE A FUSION OF LANGUID ’30S STYLES — OWENS LOVES THAT PERIOD — AND WIDE-CUT SKATER TROUSERS. IT SEEMED TOTALLY OUT OF PLACE AT A MOMENT WHEN OTHER MEN’S WEAR DESIGNERS SHOWED EITHER GENERIC SPORTSWEAR OR PREDICTABLY STRAIGHT SUITING. OWENS ISN’T OVERTLY INTERESTED IN TAILORING, THE LINCHPIN OF THE MASCULINE WARDROBE SINCE THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY. YOU SELDOM SEE ANYTHING APPROACHING A SUIT JACKET IN HIS SHOWS. “I’M NOT GOING TO BE [WHO] SOMEBODY TRUSTS FOR TAILORING OVER DIOR,” OWENS SAYS. “EVEN ONE OF MY PARTNERS. FOR HIS WEDDING, HE WORE DIOR!” WHAT HE DOES OFFER IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE GENERAL THRUST OF FASHION. AND IT’S SEDUCTIVE. HIS BUSINESS IS RELATIVELY SMALL. HIS TURNOVER IS APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION, PALTRY WHEN COMPARED TO THE BILLION-DOLLAR LUXURY BEHEMOTHS. BUT IT’S PERFECTLY FORMED. “MY MANTRA FOR EVERYBODY IS BETTER, NOT BIGGER,” HE SAYS. “BUT IT’S HARD. WHEN THERE’S A GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER, THEY’RE THINKING OF THE TEAM, AND YOU WANT TO WIN. SOMETIMES COMMERCIAL SUCCESS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TANGIBLE THAN AESTHETIC SUCCESS.” YET FOR ALL THOSE DISPARAGING COMMENTS ABOUT FASHION LEMMINGS, AND THE HORDES OF DEVOTEES CLUSTERED OUTSIDE OWENS’S SHOWS IN HIS MOST EXTREME LOOKS, A CORE OF HIS BUSINESS COMES FROM OLDER, FASHIONABLE WOMEN AND MEN, FOR WHOM A SKINNY-SLEEVED ASYMMETRIC RICK OWENS JACKET IS THE DERNIER CRI OF OFF-DUTY ELEGANCE. HE ALSO HAS A SUBSTANTIAL CELEBRITY FOLLOWING, ALTHOUGH HE DOESN’T CARE ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT. HE’S OFTEN DUBBED A “CULT DESIGNER.” “I HEAR THE WORD CULT USED A LOT,” HE ADMITS. “WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE A FOLLOWING, BUT YOU NEVER HIT THE POPULAR BIG TIME.” BUT BY HIS OWN ESTIMATION, OWENS IS NOT A CULT DESIGNER. LIKE THE CHANEL JACKET IN THE ’50S, HIS LEATHER BIKER JACKET HAS BECOME PART OF A UNIFORM OF OUR TIMES. PAY ATTENTION, AND YOU’LL SEE IT ENDLESSLY COPIED. OWENS’S OUTPUT IS PRODIGIOUS. ALONGSIDE HIS MEN’S AND WOMEN’S RUNWAY LINES AND THEIR COMMERCIAL OFFSHOOTS, HE CREATES TWO ACCESSIBLY PRICED SECONDARY LINES: LILIES, A RANGE OF JERSEY-FOCUSED WOMEN’S WEAR, AND DRKSHDW, A MORE UNISEX STREETWEAR INCARNATION THAT BEGAN AS A DENIM COLLECTION. HE ALSO HAS A FUR LINE, HUNRICKOWENS. (FROM 2003 TO 2006, OWENS WAS THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR AT THE FRENCH FURRIERS REVILLON FRÈRES.) OWENS DESIGNS NEARLY EVERY FACET OF A CONTEMPORARY WARDROBE — OUTERWEAR AND SPORTSWEAR, ACCESSORIES AND SHOES. OR, RATHER, REDESIGNS IT. HIS SNEAKERS, PRODUCED WITH ADIDAS AND RETAILING FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS A PAIR, DON’T LOOK LIKE OTHER SNEAKERS. WITH ODD PROTRUSIONS OF RUBBER OR LEATHER, THEY RESEMBLE FOSSILIZED ANIMAL REMAINS STRAPPED TO THE BODY. HIS GLOVES SOMETIMES HAVE WINGS OF LEATHER, LIKE DORSAL FINS. HE ALSO DESIGNS FURNITURE. HIS DRAMATIC PIECES RESEMBLE GREAT ALTARS OF CARRARA MARBLE OR PREHISTORIC SLABS OF 500,000-YEAR-OLD PETRIFIED WOOD. A BED HE DESIGNED LOOKS LIKE A SARCOPHAGUS CRAFTED FROM ALABASTER, AND WEIGHS OVER A TON. EVEN OWENS’S TOILETS, IN EACH OF HIS THREE HOMES, LOOK LIKE CHALICES OF MARBLE. OWENS’S FASHION EXPERIENCE BEGAN IN THE COMMERCIAL WORLD OF LOS ANGELES. AFTER DROPPING OUT OF ART SCHOOL, HE WORKED FOR A FACTORY THAT COPIED DESIGNER CLOTHING IN SHODDIER FABRICS. IN 1994, HE STARTED HIS OWN LINE, SELLING DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS. HE DIDN’T STAGE HIS FIRST SHOW IN NEW YORK UNTIL 2002. A YEAR LATER, HE RELOCATED TO PARIS. HE STILL DOESN’T SPEAK FRENCH, WHICH HE DOESN’T MIND. “I WAS JUST AS ISOLATED IN LOS ANGELES AS I AM IN PARIS,” HE SAYS. OWENS IS SOMEWHAT RECLUSIVE: HE DOESN’T GO OUT MUCH, HIS LIFE REVOLVING AROUND HIS HOME, THE GYM AND A COUPLE OF NEARBY RESTAURANTS. HE LIVES AND WORKS IN A SINGLE BUILDING, THE FORMER HEADQUARTERS OF THE FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY, ON A GRAND SQUARE OPPOSITE THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT. THE ONLY WINDOWS IN HIS STUDIO OVERLOOK THE QUIET, DESERTED GARDEN OF THE FORMER MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. HERE, HIS AESTHETIC IS COMPLETE. THE FLOORS AND MANY WALLS ARE RAW CONCRETE. OWENS GUTTED THE BUILDING WHEN HE MOVED IN, BUT DIDN’T DO MUCH ELSE. RAW WIRES HANG FROM THE CEILING. I’VE VISITED HIM HERE THREE TIMES, IN THREE DIFFERENT YEARS. EVENTUALLY I UNDERSTOOD I WASN’T STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RENOVATION. IT WAS ALREADY COMPLETE. OWENS LIVES WITH HIS WIFE OF A DECADE, FRENCH-BORN MICHÈLE LAMY, WHO IS A CREATIVE FORCE BEHIND MANY OF OWENS’S ENDEAVORS. SHE CODESIGNS A JEWELRY LINE WITH LOREE RODKIN UNDER THE OWENS UMBRELLA NAMED HUNROD (“HUN” IS OWENS’S PET NAME FOR LAMY, COMBINED WITH RODKIN’S SURNAME). SHE ALSO COLLABORATES WITH OWENS ON THE DESIGN OF HIS FURS, AND ON HIS ACCLAIMED FURNITURE LINE, AN EXHIBITION OF WHICH IS CURRENTLY ON VIEW AT THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN LOS ANGELES. SHE WALKS IN HALFWAY THROUGH OUR DISCUSSIONS, CLAD HEAD TO TOE IN RICK OWENS. HER TEETH GLISTEN WITH GOLD, HER FINGERS ARE TATTOOED AND STAINED BLACK. TOGETHER, THEY LOOK REMARKABLE — FASCINATING AND TERRIFYING IN EQUAL MEASURE. THEY SEEM PERFECTLY AT HOME IN OWENS’S ODD CLOTHES AMONG A GROUPING OF THEIR ANTHROPOMORPHIC SPINDLY CHAIRS THAT RESEMBLE SOMETHING OUT OF “BEETLEJUICE.” “THE FURNITURE THING IS REALLY ABOUT COMPLETING ...” OWENS STOPS, THEN CONTINUES: “OF COMPLETELY CREATING MY OWN PLANET.” NEAR OWENS’S STUDIO WINDOW, A HUGE ALTARPIECE OF A TABLE HOLDS AN ARRANGEMENT OF STONE BLOCKS, FLOWERS AND A SKULL. IT LOOKS EERILY LIKE A MEMENTO MORI PAINTING. HE BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT THE DARKER THEMES WITHIN HIS WORK. HIS FATHER, JOHN, A FORMER SOCIAL WORKER, DIED IN 2015, AGED 95 — WHICH PROMPTED A SERIES OF INTROSPECTIVE, SOMEWHAT NIHILISTIC COLLECTIONS. “HOW DO YOU FACE DECLINE GRACEFULLY?” HE ASKS. “I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE OF DAD DECLINING AND ME GETTING OLDER AND ME THINKING ABOUT HOW WE FACE CHANGE AND ALL OF THAT. ECOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND POLITICAL THREAT. ME THINKING, ISN’T ALL OF THIS STUFF MAYBE JUST SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?” HE SHRUGS. “OUR PRIMAL URGE IS TO PROCREATE. THAT’S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE’RE ON EARTH, OUR PRIME MOTIVATION IS TO PROCREATE AND TO LIVE FOREVER. WE’RE DOING OUR BEST TO DO BOTH, SO ISN’T IT INEVITABLE THAT WE JUST OVERCROWD IT UNTIL SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS? WE JUST KILL OURSELVES OFF? SOMETHING’S GOT TO EVOLVE.” THESE ARE SELDOM IDEAS CONNECTED TO FASHION; NOR IDEAS FASHION DESIGNERS WILLINGLY TALK ABOUT. “IT’S SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY,” HE SAYS. “IT’S JUST THE WAY — THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE. IN REAL LIFE, THE ACT OF CREATION IS DEFYING DEATH. I THINK IT’S JUST THAT DUMB AND SIMPLE.” PREAMBLE ASIDE, OWENS ISN’T FEELING PARTICULARLY DOUR. IT’S EARLY DECEMBER, AND HE’S PLANNING HIS FALL 2017 MEN’S WEAR COLLECTION, WHICH HE’LL SHOW A MONTH LATER IN PARIS. HE NAMED HIS PREVIOUS TWO COLLECTIONS “MASTODON” AND “WALRUS.” THEY CONCENTRATED ON THE PRIMORDIAL, WITH THOUGHTS ABOUT MANKIND GOING THE WAY OF THE DINOSAURS. THIS SEASON THE THEME IS “GLITTER.” “IT’S GOING TO BE ABOUT JOYFUL ABANDON,” HE SAYS. THE SHOW IS INSPIRED BY GLAM ROCK, FULL OF DOWN-PUMPED SILHOUETTES WITH A THEATRICAL BENT, A HINT OF BOWIE, POSSIBLY MEETING WAGNER, WHOSE MUSIC OWENS LOVES. THERE ARE LOTS OF OPERATIC TRAINS. IT DOESN’T CONTAIN SEQUINS, OR BEADING OR, INDEED, ANY GLITTER. “SEQUINS IN A COLLECTION CALLED ‘GLITTER,’ ” SAYS OWENS, MAKING A FACE AT SUCH BANALITY. HE’S SAVING THE EMBELLISHMENT FOR HIS NEXT COLLECTION, HE SAYS. IT’S GOING TO BE CALLED “DIRT.” “IT WAS WHAT CAN BE AS TRANSGRESSIVE AS POSSIBLE FOR ME,” OWENS SAYS. “WHENEVER I DO ANYTHING TRANSGRESSIVE, IT’S NEVER OUT OF ANGER OR JUST PROVOCATION. THERE’S USUALLY SOMETHING WELL INTENTIONED, THERE’S A WELL-INTENTIONED SPIRIT BEHIND IT.” OWENS PAUSES. HE&#39;S WORRIED HE’S TALKING TOO MUCH AGAIN. “IT’S JUST GOING TO START GETTING CORNY,” HE REASONS. “BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE OF ME THAT’S THINKING NOT EVERYBODY READS THOSE THINGS. NOT EVERYBODY IS READING EVERYTHING, SO YOU SHOULD TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PUT A POSITIVE MESSAGE OUT WHENEVER YOU CAN.” JOY AS TRANSGRESSION. IT’S A FITTING SUMMARY OF OWENS’S WORK, WHICH, FOR ALL ITS SUBVERSION WINDS UP FEELING LIKE A CELEBRATION OF THE POWER AND ENERGY OF CREATIVITY. THAT TIMES COMMENT ON OWENS’S WEBSITE, DISPARAGING HIS OUTPUT, CLOSED WITH THE REFRAIN: “A LINE NEEDS TO BE DRAWN WHEREBY CREDIT IS GIVEN TO COLLECTIONS THAT DESERVE IT. TOO MUCH TALK IS SPENT ON TOO LITTLE.” I’D ARGUE THAT IS PRECISELY WHY OWENS WARRANTS SUCH CONSISTENT APPLAUSE. HIS COLLECTIONS DESERVE TO BE TALKED ABOUT, BY US, AND BY OWENS HIMSELF. THEY’LL BE TALKED ABOUT BY FUTURE GENERATIONS, TOO, IF OWENS PROVES TO BE THE CRISTÓBAL BALENCIAGA OF OUR TIME. PRODUCING DESIGNS THAT DEFY FASHION AND CHALLENGE PHYSICS, TURNING THE HARD INTO SOFT, THE COLD INTO WARM, BLENDING MASCULINE AND FEMININE, HE VERY WELL MAY BE. “I ALWAYS THINK THAT THE ACT OF CREATION IS YOUR FIGHT FOR IMMORTALITY,” OWENS SAYS. “THE ENERGY OF RESISTING DEATH, AND TRYING TO BE REMEMBERED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY.” HE SAYS IT LIGHTLY. THEN HE STOPS TALKING. Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN 1984, THIS PEACH OF THE PRIZES AT THE CFDA FASHION AWARDS HAS BEEN HANDED TO A CANON OF CREATIVELY COMPELLING INDUSTRY FIGURES—A LIST THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY ALL-AMERICAN, BUT THAT ONCE REGULARLY SPANNED THE ATLANTIC (BOTH HUBERT DE GIVENCHY AND YVES SAINT LAURENT WON IT TWICE IN THE ’90S). OWENS IS VERY MUCH A NORTH AMERICAN DESIGNER. HE WAS RAISED A BIBLIOPHILE AND (CLASSICAL) MELOMANIAC IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA. HE IS, VIA HIS MOTHER, CONNIE, OF PARTIAL-MEXICAN DESCENT. HE PARTIED HARD AND HONED HIS AESTHETIC PROCLIVITIES HAUNTING LOS ANGELES’S SPOTLIGHT CLUB AND HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN THE LATE ’80S AND ’90S. YET HE IS FAR FROM DEFINED BY HIS AMERICAN-NESS, AND HAS BEEN BASED SINCE 2003 IN PARIS ALONGSIDE HIS FRENCH-BORN WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY. THEY MADE THAT MOVE JUST TWO SEASONS AFTER OWENS MADE HIS NEW YORK RUNWAY DEBUT IN FEBRUARY 2002. BUT BACK TO THAT CALL. HI RICK, THANKS FOR CALLING! SO THE FIRST QUESTION HAS TO BE: HOW DOES IT FEEL TO RECEIVE THIS LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD? “I’M JUST TICKLED TO DEATH! I KNOW PERHAPS THE FIRST THING I’M SUPPOSED TO SAY IS ‘OH, IT MAKES ME FEEL SO OLD,’ BUT IT ACTUALLY DOESN’T; IT’S INCREDIBLY FLATTERING. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS AWARD, AT LEAST IN MY HEAD, IS RECOGNIZING A BODY OF WORK RATHER THAN JUST ONE COLLECTION. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT: FOR EVERYTHING THAT I DO TO BE PART OF A BODY OF WORK, ALL RELATED. SO FOR THIS COUNCIL OF AESTHETIC LEADERS TO FOCUS THEIR GENERAL APPROVAL IN MY DIRECTION IS VERY VALIDATING. WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I’M THINKING THAT I’M PART OF A CULTURAL MOMENT. THAT KIND OF PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD IS VERY FULFILLING. WE ALL WANT TO BE INVOLVED AND WE ALL WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR BEING SPECIAL, SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS . . . YOU’VE REALLY WON! WOW! DOES THAT SOUND LIKE I’M GLOATING? I REALLY WOULDN’T WANT TO SOUND LIKE THAT. I’M JUST VERY HAPPY.” YOU HAVE BEEN BASED IN PARIS FOR SO LONG, BUT YOUR RUNWAY LIFE STARTED IN NEW YORK WAY BACK WHEN. “YES, AND IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT. I’D BEEN SELLING CLOTHES FOR AROUND FIVE YEARS IN STORES LIKE BENDEL’S. I HAD JUST A TINY LITTLE RACK. I’D TAKE THE CLOTHES TO THE STORE, SHOW THEM TO SOMEBODY IN THE BACK OF THE STORE AND SELL THEM LIKE THAT. IT WAS AMERICAN VOGUE THAT MADE THE SHOWS HAPPEN. IN FACT, ANDRÉ LEON TALLEY CALLED ME OUT OF THE BLUE. AND HE SAID: ‘THIS IS ANDRÉ LEON TALLEY. I SAW YOUR COLLECTION IN THE WINDOW OF BENDEL’S AND I WANT YOU TO SEE ANNA [WINTOUR].’ AND I SAID: ‘OKAY!’ SOON AFTERWARD THEY OFFERED ME A RUNWAY SHOW WITH THEIR ENDORSEMENT AND SUPPORT. AND THAT WAS, OF COURSE, AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. BUT I WAS STILL A LITTLE HESITANT. BECAUSE I THOUGHT MY CLOTHES WERE REALLY NOT FROM THAT WORLD. AND I WORRIED THAT, WHILE ONE SHOW OR TWO SHOWS I COULD DO, I WAS NOT GOING TO CHANGE FAST ENOUGH OR BE EXCITING ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THAT KIND OF SCRUTINY. I THOUGHT I RISKED BURNING EVERYTHING DOWN, OR BURNING IT OUT, BY DOING THESE SHOWS; WHEREAS IF I STAYED QUIETLY DOING MY THING IN MY LOS ANGELES CORNER, I COULD KEEP SUSTAINING A NICE THING. BUT, YOU KNOW: WHEN YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THAT, IT’S KIND OF LIKE, HEY, I’M 45, I MIGHT AS WELL TRY AND TAKE A CHANCE. AMERICAN VOGUE GAVE ME ALL THE BEST PRODUCTION SUPPORT, THE BEST MODELS; THEY TOTALLY SUPPORTED ME. AND THAT GAVE ME SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE, WHICH ALLOWED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO REGISTER WHO I WAS AND WHAT I DID. AND YOU KNOW I’M NOT SURE THAT SO MANY EMERGING DESIGNERS GET THAT CHANCE TODAY; WE ARE SO OVERSATURATED, THERE ARE SO MANY EVENTS, AND IN THE BLUR OF THAT IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO CREATE THE SPACE AND TIME FOR PEOPLE TO REGISTER. SO YOU WENT FOR IT. “YEAH! I REMEMBER THE MUSIC FOR THAT FIRST SHOW WAS IGGY POP AND ALICE COOPER. IT IS STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE SOUNDTRACKS AND I WENT BACK TO BOTH ARTISTS FOR MY FIRST SHOW IN PARIS TOO. AND I GRADUALLY LEARNED, OR THINK I LEARNED, HOW TO BE CONSISTENT WITH MY AESTHETIC BUT TO CHANGE IT ENOUGH, TOO, SO THAT IT KIND OF WORKS. AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE AT SOME POINT JUST DECIDED TO TOLERATE MY PACE, AND I FELT VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT.” OH, COME ON, RICK! THIS AWARD SUGGESTS YOUR PACE IS MORE LOVED THAN MERELY TOLERATED! “WELL, I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT MY VISIBILITY OR WHERE I STAND IN THE FASHION WORLD. BECAUSE THAT’S JUST NEVER GOING TO BE A COMFORTABLE SPACE. I JUST LIKE TO STICK TO MY THING. I’M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING I BELIEVE IN.” I MAY BE OVERREACHING HERE, BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT AS AMERICA GOES THROUGH THIS PAINFUL CONSERVATIVE MOMENT, IT IS VERY CANNY OF THE CFDA THROUGH THIS PRIZE TO PROMOTE YOU, A DESIGNER WHO REPRESENTS THE ANTITHESIS OF AMERICAN CONSERVATISM, AS A PERSONIFICATION OF U.S. FASHION. “I DO THINK THAT I AM MAKING EFFORTS TO BALANCE OUT CONSERVATIVE ENERGY, AND THE FALSE MORALITY AND JUDGMENTAL ATTITUDE THAT I’VE ALWAYS FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH. I DO LIKE TO TEASE THAT. MAYBE BRING A LITTLE KARMIC BALANCE. BUT I MEAN IT IN THE MOST PLAYFUL WAY—NOT ANTAGONISTIC, NOT HOSTILE. THE WORLD CAN BE REALLY UPTIGHT. EVERYBODY TAKES EVERYTHING SO SERIOUSLY NOW, AND THE INTERNET HAS ENCOURAGED US TO BE SO QUICK TO JUDGE, AND DAMN, AND DISAPPROVE. I’M PUTTING A LOT OF STUFF OUT THERE TO DISAPPROVE OF, AND I’M DOING IT GLEEFULLY!” *THIS INTERVIEW HAS BEEN CONDENSED AND EDITED, BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE RIVETING RICK OWENS FONT OF DISCOURSE RUNNETH WAY OVER MY ABILITY TO TYPE IN TANDEM WITH IT.

LIVING IN PARIS FOR THE PAST 13 YEARS, RICK OWENS CONTINUES TO SURPRISE FASHION FANS. STEP-BY-STEP, FROM SHOW TO SHOW, HE’S EXPANDED HIS SUPPORTERS FROM REBELLIOUS ANTI-FASHION KIDS TO ELEGANT EUROPEAN WOMEN LOOKING FOR ALLURE AND DISTINCTION. HE NEVER REPEATS HIMSELF AND HAS NEVER COMPROMISED ALONG HIS DARK, MYSTERIOUS PATH. RETICENT BUT OPENMINDED AND KIND, HE AVOIDS THE MEDIA. HE IS ESPECIALLY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUNG ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS, SUCH AS GARETH PUGH. HIS LONGEVITY, CREATIVITY, CLAIRVOYANCE, AND HONESTY ARE A RADICAL EXCEPTION IN FASHION TODAY… AND NOW, WITH HIS WIFE MICHÈLE, HE’S ADDED HIS IMPRINT TO THE DESIGN WORLD WITH A LINE OF FURNITURE THAT CHALLENGES FUNCTIONALITY WITH A TOTEMIC AURA AND STRIKING SCULPTURAL IMPACT. OLIVIER ZAHM— SO, RICK, YOU WERE SAYING… RICK OWENS — I’VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT ECOLOGY IN THE PAST COUPLE OF SEASONS, NOT BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT ECOLOGICALLY, ALTHOUGH I THINK IT’S A GOOD IDEA. WHAT I LIKE ARE THE INTENTIONS, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN URGE IS TO PROCREATE. OLIVIER ZAHM — WHICH GOES WITH POLLUTION AND CONSUMPTION? RICK OWENS — WELL, YES, AND THE URGE TO LIVE FOREVER: PROCREATION AND TO LIVE FOREVER. WE ALL HAVE THESE URGES. PEOPLE HAVE MORE BABIES. THEY LIVE LONGER. THE WORLD IS BECOMING MORE CROWDED AND USING UP ITS RESOURCES. SO WE HAVE TO GENETICALLY MODIFY RESOURCES TO EXTEND THEM. MAYBE ALL THIS REACHES A KIND OF CLIMAX, AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS. MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT WAS THAT MAYBE [THERE’S] A TRANSITION, WITH THE IDEA OF ACCEPTING IT GRACEFULLY, AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THE TRANSITION AS ELEGANT AND GRACEFUL AS POSSIBLE, INSTEAD OF FEELING DREAD, PANIC, AND HYSTERIA… OLIVIER ZAHM — AND NOT HAVING TOO RADICAL OR VIOLENT A TRANSITION? RICK OWENS — YEAH. BUT THAT’S A VERY FATALISTIC ATTITUDE, AND THAT’S NOT THAT HEALTHY, EITHER. I DON’T MEAN TO MAKE ANY KIND OF STRIDENT OPINION BECAUSE I’M NOT GOOD AT STRIDENT OPINIONS. I’M THE LEAST OPINIONATED. BUT I DO LIKE TO SEE EVERY SIDE OF AN ISSUE. OLIVIER ZAHM — WE’RE DEFINITELY FACING A BIG CHANGE GLOBALLY AND POLITICALLY, BUT ALSO IN FASHION. FASHION’S CHANGED SO MUCH SINCE YOU STARTED. RICK OWENS — CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? ISN’T IT CRAZY? OLIVIER ZAHM — YES. THERE ARE SO MANY BRANDS, EVEN FAKE BRANDS ON THE INTERNET. RICK OWENS — I DON’T EVEN SEE THE FULL SPECTRUM THE WAY YOU DO BECAUSE YOU’RE OUT THERE SEARCHING AND EXPLORING ALL THE TIME. WHAT’S IT LIKE? I SHOULD INTERVIEW YOU. HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN INTEREST? OLIVIER ZAHM — IT’S A BIT DESTABILIZING. BUT THERE’S ALSO A PARADOX. WITH MORE BRANDS ON THE MARKET, MORE DESIGNERS, MORE BOUTIQUES, AND MORE E-COMMERCE EMERGING AND COEXISTING TODAY, YOU NEED REAL CREATIVITY AND A POINT OF VIEW. BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALSO FEEL THAT CREATIVITY IS BACK — AND THAT YOU’RE ONE OF THE RARE DESIGNERS WHO MAINTAIN CREATIVE AMBITION. RICK OWENS — I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S A BAD THING THAT THERE ARE SO MANY BRANDS. I MEAN, THERE I GO AGAIN. I’M ALWAYS SAYING, “EVERYTHING’S OKAY.” I HAVE A THING ABOUT NOT BEING OVERLY CRITICAL. I AM AESTHETICALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THAT’S MY JOB. I LOOK AT EVERYTHING I MAKE AND ELIMINATE WHAT ISN’T AS GOOD AS IT POSSIBLY CAN BE. SO I HAVE TO BE CRITICAL. BUT IN LIFE, I’M VERY CONSCIOUS OF NOT BEING A CRITICAL VOICE. OLIVIER ZAHM — OF NEGATIVITY? RICK OWENS — YEAH, BECAUSE IT’S JUST TOO EASY TO BE NEGATIVE: EVERYONE DOES THAT. SO WHY SHOULD I JOIN THEM? THAT’S WHY I FEEL LIKE I END UP BEING AMBIGUOUS. BUT AESTHETICALLY, I HAVE A VERY DEFINITE POINT OF VIEW. OLIVIER ZAHM — YES, AND A VERY PRECISE ONE. RICK OWENS — I HOPE SO. BUT WITH SO MANY CREATIVE VOICES IN THE WORLD, MAYBE IT’S JUST ANOTHER OPTION. ANYWAY, THE BEST ALWAYS RISES TO THE SURFACE. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT IT’S A DISSOLUTION OF CREATIVITY, WITH ALL THESE NEW BRANDS AND NEW FAKE BRANDS. RICK OWENS — I HAVE GAY FRIENDS IN THEIR 50S AND 60S WHO’VE NEVER HAD A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO HANDSOME. BUT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IT’S JUST THAT THEY HAD TOO MANY OPTIONS. AND IT’S… OLIVIER ZAHM — A METAPHOR FOR WHAT’S GOING ON TODAY? RICK OWENS — I THINK SO. TO NEVER BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON ONE PERSON BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS TOO MANY CHOICES IS HARD. THAT’S KIND OF WHAT THE FASHION WORLD IS LIKE NOW. SOMETIMES WHEN I LOOK AT FASHION, OR AT THE MAGAZINES, EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE A TEENAGE GIRL’S CLOSET, WITH LOTS OF CUTE, HAPPY, FUNNY, CHEERFUL THINGS, WITHOUT A SPECIFIC POINT OF VIEW. BUT THAT’S NOT THE ENTIRE WORLD. THERE IS A FACTION THAT KNOWS PRECISELY WHAT THEY WANT, THAT WANTS TO EDIT AND TO ELIMINATE. OLIVIER ZAHM — TO ELIMINATE THE SUPERFICIALITY? RICK OWENS — TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO CHANGE LOOKS EVERY DAY OR EVERY WEEK. OLIVIER ZAHM — BY LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN OR A MORE STABLE KIND OF ELEGANCE? RICK OWENS — OR NOT TO NEED SO MUCH STIMULATION. STIMULATION IS GREAT. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I LOVED BEING OVER-STIMULATED. I HAVE VERY FOND MEMORIES OF THAT. BUT IT’S NOT THE SAME. AND I’M NOT THE ONLY PERSON LIKE THAT. SO, LUCKILY FOR ME, THERE’S A FACTION THAT WILL ACCEPT THE THINGS I PROPOSE. I HAVE A VERY SMALL CORNER OF THE FASHION WORLD. IT’S A VERY QUIET LITTLE NICHE, WHICH IS FANTASTIC. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT IT’S GROWING — YOUR CLIENTELE IS GROWING. RICK OWENS — BUT I’M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY EVERYBODY. I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO RUN A BIG HOUSE WHERE YOU HAVE TO SATISFY A LOT OF PEOPLE. I DON’T THINK THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR ME. I THINK I’VE GOTTEN THIS FAR BECAUSE MY AESTHETIC IS SO NARROW. I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SATISFY A GREATER NEED. OLIVIER ZAHM — I THINK YOUR AUDIENCE IS GROWING. RICK OWENS — I’M NOT IN ANY WAY BRAGGING, BUT THINGS HAPPEN IN CYCLES. SOMETIMES WHAT YOU’RE DOING RESONATES WITH THE WORLD AND IS RELEVANT, AND SOMETIMES NOT. YOU CAN SEE HOW SOME DESIGNERS ARE RELEVANT AT A MOMENT, AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS. OLIVIER ZAHM — SOMETHING HAPPENS. IT’S THE SAME FOR MAGAZINES. RICK OWENS — THAT’S WHAT I’M SAYING. LIKE YOU AND ME. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? OLIVIER ZAHM — ONCE WE REACH A CERTAIN POINT, THERE’S NO TURNING BACK. RICK OWENS — WELL, IF WE DON’T RECOGNIZE IT, THAT COULD HAPPEN. OLIVIER ZAHM — YOU HAVE A NARROW BUT VERY PRECISE POINT OF VIEW, AND YOU ALSO CHANGE. EACH COLLECTION IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE BEFORE, AND YOU’RE ABLE TO CONSTANTLY FIND NEW INSPIRATION. EACH TIME I SEE ONE OF YOUR SHOWS, I’M SURPRISED. RICK OWENS — YOU KNOW WHAT? I LOVE IT WHEN SOMEBODY CAN DO A VERY SMALL GESTURE AND CHANGE THINGS. THAT’S SOMETHING I ADMIRE. I’M VERY CONSCIOUS OF THAT. I LOVE THE IDEA OF SOMETHING SMALL MAKING A DIFFERENCE. SO IF I CAN KIND OF DO THAT… OLIVIER ZAHM — AND CONSTANTLY REINVENT YOURSELF? RICK OWENS — WITHOUT HAVING TO EXERT MYSELF COMPLETELY, WITHOUT HAVING TO BE A TOTAL WHORE, WITH SUBTLE LITTLE TWEAKS. YEAH, THAT’S A GREAT THING. THAT’S KIND OF WHAT I AIM FOR. OLIVIER ZAHM — HOW DO YOU WORK? DO YOU CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO CONSTANTLY EVOLVE? RICK OWENS — I DO. IT’S A LOT OF WORK. AND I REALLY DO CHALLENGE MYSELF. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT HOW DO YOU START? WITH A FABRIC? AN IDEA? MUSIC? RICK OWENS — WELL, YOU KNOW, I NEVER START BECAUSE I NEVER STOP. BECAUSE YOU’RE WORKING ON SPRING AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU’RE SHOWING FALL FASHION. IT’S ALWAYS A SERIES. I’M CONSUMING IDEAS AND AESTHETICS, AND ALL THE TIME LOOKING AROUND FOR THINGS THAT LOOK RIGHT. I’M LOOKING AT COLORS. I’M LOOKING AT LINES IN THE STREET. I’M ON THE METRO, AND I’M LOOKING AT PEOPLE’S SHOES IN THE METRO: HOW WOULD I DO THAT? HOW WOULD I CHANGE IT? IT’S ALWAYS A ROLLING PROCESS THAT NEVER REALLY STARTS AT ANY ONE PLACE. I JUST COLLECT A BANK OF IDEAS IN MY HEAD, OR IMAGES ON MY COMPUTER, AND THEN EVENTUALLY IT ALL GETS PUT TOGETHER IN A COLLECTION. I GO THROUGH ALL OF THE STIMULATIONS AND MAKE A COMPOSITION OF THINGS I’VE SEEN. OLIVIER ZAHM — SO YOU’RE ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF WORK. RICK OWENS — WHICH I LOVE. I LIKE GOING FAST. I LIKE BEING STIMULATED AND HAVING A SENSE OF PURPOSE EVERY DAY. I DON’T WANT TO GO ANY SLOWER. IT’S GREAT. AND IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF I WORKED FOR A COMPANY. IT WOULD BE TOO DIFFERENT. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT YOU DID THE FUR COMPANY. RICK OWENS — YEAH. IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE — I MEAN, REVILLON. BUT I ONLY DID IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T HAVE ANY MONEY, AND I HAD MORE MONEY. I DID IT BECAUSE OF THE CRAFTSMANSHIP. BECAUSE IT WAS PURELY FUR. IT WAS THE VERY TOP. IT WAS JUST TO GET THEM STARTED. AND THEN THEY DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH MUSCLE TO REALLY MOVE IT FORWARD. BUT I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME WHILE I WAS THERE. OLIVIER ZAHM — I REALLY ENJOYED YOUR REVILLON COLLECTION AT THE TIME. RICK OWENS — I DID, TOO, AND IT WAS A FUN THING TO DO. BUT THE THING I REALLY HADN’T ANTICIPATED WAS THAT IT MADE PEOPLE IN PARIS ACCEPT ME IN A DIFFERENT WAY — THAN IF I’D BEEN SIMPLY AN AMERICAN COMING TO PRESENT MY COLLECTIONS. THEY WERE IMPRESSED. BUT I DIDN’T DO IT DELIBERATELY. IT WASN’T CALCULATED. IT JUST HAPPENED. AND I STILL DO FURS. EVER SINCE THEN, WE’VE ALWAYS DONE FURS, AND WE HAVE THEM PRODUCED IN PARIS, AND IT’S A NICE STORY. OLIVIER ZAHM — LET’S SPEAK ABOUT SEXUALITY TODAY BECAUSE FASHION CHANGED, BUT SEXUALITY HAS CHANGED, TOO. RICK OWENS — YOU KNOW WHAT? I’M READING SHOCK AND AWE, BY SIMON REYNOLDS. IT’S ABOUT GLAM ROCK, GLITTER ROCK. I’D CALLED THE NEW COLLECTION “GLITTER,” AND THEN I GOT THIS BOOK, WHICH IS ALL ABOUT GLITTER ROCK AND EVERYTHING GLAM. OLIVIER ZAHM — IS THIS AN INSPIRATION FOR YOUR THE FALL/WINTER 2017 COLLECTION? RICK OWENS — YES. THAT’S THE COLLECTION I’M WORKING ON RIGHT NOW; I’M CALLING IT “GLITTER,” EVEN THOUGH I’M NOT GOING TO DO ANY SEQUINS OR BEADS. IT’S MORE ABOUT THE ENERGY, THE IDEA OF FLAMBOYANCE AND TRANSGRESSION — AND THERE WAS A JOYOUS ENERGY ABOUT SEXUAL LIBERATION AT THE TIME. THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE OF HUMOR, AND THE IDEA OF EMBRACING THE RIDICULOUS. NOW, I HATE BEING ONE OF THOSE OLD GUYS WHO TALKS ABOUT HOW IT WAS BETTER BEFORE. I MEAN, I DIDN’T LIVE THROUGH GLAM ROCK, EITHER. THAT WAS RIGHT BEFORE MY TIME. BUT CONTEMPORARY INTERNET CULTURE IS VERY MUCH ABOUT COLLAGE AND PASTICHE. OLIVIER ZAHM — AND REPRODUCTIONS AND COPIES? RICK OWENS — EVERYTHING IS COPYING ANYWAY. IN ANY CREATIVE GESTURE, YOU ARE WORKING WITH SOMETHING THAT CAME BEFORE. BUT IT’S SO LITERAL NOW. I’M NOT CRITICIZING IT. I’M THINKING, “WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?” OLIVIER ZAHM — BECAUSE THERE ARE LITERAL COPIES, WHICH MAYBE PUSH SOMETHING FROM INSIDE THE COPY? A DIFFERENT LOOK AT THE PAST? RICK OWENS — EVERYONE COPIES. SOME ARE SMART, AND SOME AREN’T. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT TO GO BACK TO SEXUALITY AND GLAMOUR, WE ARE IN A NEW SEXUAL REVOLUTION TODAY THROUGH THE INTERNET. RICK OWENS — ARE WE? TELL ME. OLIVIER ZAHM — I’LL TELL YOU A FEW SIGNS. PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY TAKING SELFIES AND PROMOTING THEMSELVES ON THE INTERNET, AND SO THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONTACT ARE EXTENDED, WITH CONNECTIONS ALL OVER THE PLANET. THIS LIBERATES PEOPLE FROM THE BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND AND THE LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND THEM. IT CREATES A NEW KIND OF OPENNESS AND A NEW POSSIBILITY OF FREEDOM. RICK OWENS — BUT DOESN’T IT MAKE IT HARDER TO CONNECT BECAUSE OF TOO MANY CHOICES? OLIVIER ZAHM — YES. LIKE WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE ABOUT HANDSOME PEOPLE UNABLE TO DECIDE ON A SINGLE LOVER. RICK OWENS — ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE IN THIS GENERATION FEEL ENTITLED — TO BE BETTER AND TO HAVE MORE. OLIVIER ZAHM — THERE’S ALSO WHAT’S CALLED “GENDER FLUIDITY,” WHICH OPENS UP THE GENDER DEFINITION LIKE NEVER BEFORE. RICK OWENS — NO. THEY DID IT HARDER, STRONGER, BIGGER, AND LOUDER IN THE ’70S, WHICH WAS WAY MORE ADVENTUROUS. KIDS CAN DO ANYTHING, AND THERE’S NO BIG SCANDAL. THEN, IT WAS HARD TO WEAR LIPSTICK. THAT ALONE WAS TRANSGRESSIVE AND SUPER HARD CORE. MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT THE DRUGS BACK THEN. THERE WAS MORE ACID. OLIVIER ZAHM — THAT’S TRUE. RICK OWENS — WITH HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS, PEOPLE WERE EXPANDING THEIR MINDS AND SEEING THINGS IN THE EXTREME. OPTIONS SEEMED ENDLESS; POSSIBILITIES WERE EXCITING. NOW, WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY’RE DOING ICE, METH, AND ECSTASY. THEY’RE NOT EXPLORATIVE OR ADVENTUROUS DRUGS. IT’S A DIFFERENT THING. OLIVIER ZAHM — WELL, IT’S MORE NARCISSISTIC, MORE ABOUT YOURSELF. RICK OWENS — MAYBE KIDS NEED ACID. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT IT’S FUNNY THAT YOU GO BACK TO GLAM BECAUSE YOU’RE FAMOUS FOR GRAY, BLACK, AND EARTHY COLORS, LIKE BROWN. RICK OWENS — YEAH. OLIVIER ZAHM — ARE YOU LOOKING AT COLORS? RICK OWENS — WELL, I AM DOING COLORS MORE THAN I USED TO, AND THE REASON IS THAT I HAVE A BIT MORE CONTROL WITH DYE HOUSES AND FABRIC PEOPLE THAN I DID 10 YEARS AGO. NOW I’M ABLE TO GET THE WEIRD, SATURATED COLORS WITH NEUTRAL TONES. OLIVIER ZAHM — WHICH IS MORE LIKE YOU. RICK OWENS — SO I CAN DO COLORS BETTER THAN I DID BEFORE. OLIVIER ZAHM — IN THE SPRING/SUMMER 2016 COLLECTION THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE DRESS. RICK OWENS — YEAH, TECHNICALLY: A PURPLE THAT HAS GREEN IN IT, AND AN ORANGE THAT HAS BLUE IN IT. I’M NOW ABLE TO GET COLORS THAT I WANT JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER. I MEAN, I LOVE FLAMBOYANCE AND TRANSGRESSION, BUT MY WHOLE THING, WHEN I STARTED OUT, WAS TO EXAGGERATE SHAPES IN A SOFT GRAY, WHICH MADE THEM NOT SO MUCH ABOUT SPECIAL OCCASION DRESSING. I TOOK MORE RADICAL SHAPES AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE DAYTIME, SO THAT PEOPLE COULD WEAR THEM EVERY DAY. I ALWAYS WANTED TO BRING FLAMBOYANCE AND EXAGGERATION INTO NORMAL LIFE. I NEVER WANTED THERE TO BE A DISCONNECTION BETWEEN EXAGGERATION AND WHAT YOU COULD REALLY DO. DO YOU REMEMBER THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW? THERE WAS A SONG: “DON’T DREAM IT, BE IT.” THAT INSPIRED ME. AND THAT WAS ABOUT GLITTER ROCK. BUT IT WOULDN’T WORK NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING. I MEAN, YOUNG KIDS WEAR EYELINER NOW. WHO CARES? IT’S BEEN DONE. OLIVIER ZAHM — THAT’S TRUE. BUT THIS BANALITY TODAY IS ALSO THE STARTING POINT FOR A NEW POSSIBILITY BECAUSE, AS YOU SAY, IT’S NOT A STAGE. THIS KIND OF TRANSGRESSION OR ATTITUDE CAN BE INTRODUCED INTO EVERYDAY LIFE BECAUSE, IN A WAY, THERE’S NO TRANSGRESSION ANYMORE. RICK OWENS — BUT PEOPLE WON’T DO IT. THERE WAS AN APPRECIATION OF THE RIDICULOUS. PEOPLE WON’T ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE RIDICULOUS ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE CRITICISM. EVERYBODY IS CRITICIZED ON THE INTERNET. WHATEVER YOU WEAR, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CRITICIZE YOU. SO NOW, BECAUSE THERE’S TOO MUCH CRITICISM, IT’S ALL ABOUT RESTRAINT; IT’S ALL ABOUT WEARING SOMETHING UNCRITICIZABLE. WHICH IS AN INTERESTING THING. IT CREATES DIFFERENT RULES, WHICH ARE FUN TO PLAY WITH, TOO. SO THE CLOTHES THAT LOOK INTERESTING NOW ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WEIRDNESS. I LIKE THE WEIRDNESS. FLAMBOYANT CLAUDE MONTANA CLOTHES SIMPLY WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE RIGHT NOW. THEY WOULD LOOK LIKE YOU ARE TRYING TOO HARD. THERE HAS TO BE INDIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW IN APPEARANCE. YOU HAVE TO APPEAR INDIFFERENT AND EFFORTLESS. THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT. WHEN YOU SEE HOW THE RULES CHANGE, YOU HAVE TO ADAPT. OLIVIER ZAHM — BUT MY POINT ABOUT SEXUALITY IS ABOUT A NEW GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OPEN SEXUALLY, OR TO THEIR SEXUAL IDENTITY, WHICH IS MORE COMPLEX AND MAYBE LESS CONFORMIST. AND FASHION IS A WAY TO EXPRESS THAT SEXUAL IDENTITY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF YOUNG DESIGNERS WHO ARE ROLE MODELS. AND I THINK YOU’RE SOMEONE WHO OPENED UP THIS POSSIBILITY IN FASHION. RICK OWENS — THAT’S GREAT. OLIVIER ZAHM — YES, THAT’S GREAT BECAUSE GENERALLY, WITH FASHION AND WITH FASHION DESIGN, THERE IS USUALLY A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED DIVISION BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE. AND YOU BLUR THIS DIVISION. YOU START FROM A CERTAIN ELEGANCE AND A CERTAIN ATTITUDE, WHICH IS VERY INSPIRING FOR THIS NEW GENERATION OF DESIGNERS — LIKE WITH HOOD BY AIR, FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE OTHERS. RICK OWENS— YEAH, IF I’M ABLE TO CORRUPT YOUNG STRAIGHT BOYS, I LOVE THAT. OH, GOD. I’M GOING TO BE JAILED FOR SAYING THAT. OLIVIER ZAHM — IS YOUR WORK ABOUT TRANSGRESSION AND LOVE? RICK OWENS — YES, IT’S STILL ABOUT LOVE. WHAT WE’RE SAYING IS THAT KIDS NEED TO GET THEIR ENERGY UP AND TAKE SOME F CKING ACID. OLIVIER ZAHM — NOTHING IS REAL WITHOUT LOVE. OTHERWISE, IT’S EMPTY. RICK OWENS — IT’S A CHEERFUL, AFFECTIONATE TRANSGRESSION. IT’S CERTAINLY NOT ANGER. I’M NEVER ANGRY. OLIVIER ZAHM — WE FEEL THAT IN YOUR COLLECTION AND IN YOUR LAST SHOW — THE LOVE YOU EXPRESSED. RICK OWENS — WASN’T THAT GORGEOUS? OLIVIER ZAHM — IT WAS FANTASTIC. RICK OWENS — “BLACK IS THE COLOR OF MY TRUE LOVE’S HAIR” — THAT SONG, THE FIRST SONG, WAS AMAZING. SO BEAUTIFUL. OLIVIER ZAHM — SO JUST ONE WORD ABOUT YOUR FURNITURE. YOUR FURNITURE IS NOW ESTABLISHED IN THE DESIGN WORLD. BUT NOW YOU’RE A DESIGNER OF CLOTHES AND FURNITURE. HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE THEM? OR ARE THEY EQUAL? RICK OWENS — EQUAL? OH GOD, NO. THE CLOTHES ARE WAY, WAY BIGGER THAN THE FURNITURE. THE FURNITURE IS A WONDERFUL THING TO DO, IN GALLERIES AND STUFF. IN FACT, I HAVE A SHOW OPENING AT MOCA [MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART, LOS ANGELES]. MICHÈLE IS IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW INSTALLING IT. AND I HAVE A BOOK COMING OUT WITH RIZZOLI FOR THE FURNITURE AT THE SAME TIME. THE BOOK WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE OPENING. BUT THE FURNITURE IS REALLY MICHÈLE’S CREATION. I MEAN, I STARTED IT, BUT THEN MICHÈLE PUT THE ENERGY INTO IT. BECAUSE MAKING FURNITURE REQUIRES A LOT OF LOVE AND ATTENTION. OLIVIER ZAHM — IT’S A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS. RICK OWENS — IT’S ALSO NOT SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO DO. IT WASN’T A BUSINESS IDEA. IT WAS AN AESTHETIC INDULGENCE AND FUN TO DO TOGETHER. THEN IT FOUND AN AUDIENCE, WHICH WAS NICE. OLIVIER ZAHM — AND RECONNECTION IN THE DESIGN WORLD. YOU AND MICHÈLE ARE NOW ALSO SEEN AS FURNITURE DESIGNERS. RICK OWENS — BUT THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT’S A PERSONAL AND VERY SINCERE EXPRESSION OF THE WAY WE LIVE AND OF THINGS WE WANT. WHICH IS IRONIC, I GUESS, BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AROUND THIS HOUSE, THERE’S ALMOST NOTHING FROM THE FURNITURE COLLECTION HERE — BECAUSE ALL THE PIECES ARE IN SHOWS. EVERYBODY ELSE GETS A DELIVERY BEFORE I DO. SO THIS PERSONAL EXPRESSION BENEFITS EVERYONE BUT US. OLIVIER ZAHM — YES, AREN’T THEY MORE BRUTALIST THAN COMFORTABLE? RICK OWENS — YOU’D BE SURPRISED. A LOT HAVE MATTRESSES FITTED INTO THEM. SO ALMOST EVERYTHING ENDS UP BEING A DAYBED, OR A BIG BENCH. YOU PUT A MATTRESS ON IT, AND IT’S A DAYBED. AND THEN THERE ARE THE BEDS — AND THE CHAIRS! OH, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE BONE CHAIRS. OLIVIER ZAHM — SO FASHION AND FURNITURE DESIGN ARE TWO DISTINCT ACTIVITIES. ARE THEY TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN YOUR MIND, OR ARE THEY PART OF A RELATED INSPIRATION? RICK OWENS — IT REALLY IS A VERY SELFISH EXERCISE OF WHAT I WANT, WHAT I WANT TO SAY, AND WHAT I WANT TO PRODUCE. BUT IT’S ALMOST NEVER: “WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT?” OR EVEN, “WHAT DO PEOPLE NEED?” THAT WOULDN’T WORK. I CALL IT A CONVERSATION. WHAT’S GREAT ABOUT MAKING THINGS IS BEING LISTENED TO. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE LISTENED TO. YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO LISTEN TO YOU. YOU WANT YOUR LOVER TO LISTEN TO YOU. YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO LISTEN TO YOU. OLIVIER ZAHM — TRUE. RICK OWENS — YOU SAY SOMETHING, AND YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO LISTEN. I FEEL GREAT SATISFACTION IN THAT I WAS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THIS WAY. I’M NOT THAT COMFORTABLE IN GROUPS — I’M NOT SHY, I JUST NEVER REALLY LEARNED HOW TO WORK WITH A TEAM. I NEVER PLAYED GROUP SPORTS OR LEARNED HOW TO BE COMFORTABLE IN A GROUP. MICHÈLE, FOR EXAMPLE, WENT TO A BOARDING SCHOOL, WHERE I THINK YOU LEARN A DIFFERENT SET OF SKILLS. I DIDN’T REALLY LEARN THOSE. SO MY COMFORT LEVEL IS ONE THAT IS TO BE VERY MUCH ALONE. BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD. I WANT TO BE PART OF THE WORLD. I OFTEN DRANK TOO MUCH TO MAKE MYSELF BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE PART OF IT. TO PARTICIPATE. I DID THAT FOR A LONG TIME. NOW, I FEEL LIKE I’VE PARTICIPATED. IT’S THE MOST WONDERFUL FEELING. OLIVIER ZAHM — WHAT’S REALLY IMPORTANT IS YOUR ONGOING ROLE IN THE FASHION WORLD. RICK OWENS — IT’S GREAT THAT I’VE BEEN INVOLVED AND HAVE BEEN LISTENED TO.

WHAT STARTED IN 2007 AS “A CONVERSATION AND A ROMP” WITH HIS WIFE AND MUSE MS MICHÈLE LAMY HAS TURNED INTO A SEPARATE ENTITY THAT STRETCHES TO MORE THAN 55 PIECES OF FURNITURE MADE BY THE PAIR. COLLECTORS COVET THEM, WHILE INSTITUTIONS, FROM THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN LOS ANGELES TO CARPENTERS WORKSHOP GALLERY IN LONDON, ELEVATE THEM TO ARTWORKS. THE BOOK CHARTS THE JOURNEY OF THE WORKS – FROM MARBLE QUARRY TO MASTER CRAFTSMAN, TANNERY TO TABLE TOP – AND OF THEIR CREATORS, WHOSE INTIMATE CONVERSATIONS AND ELEGANT INTERIORS COMPLETE THE MISE EN SCÈNE. TO MARK ITS LAUNCH AND HIS COLLABORATION WITH MR PORTER, WE SAT DOWN WITH THE MAN HIMSELF TO TALK ABOUT HIS FUTURE AND FURNITURE. THE FURNITURE STAYS CLOSE TO YOUR FASHION IN TERMS OF AESTHETIC AND FORM. WILL IT STAY THAT WAY? WE RECENTLY DID SOME SHINY, SLICK STEEL PIECES THAT SHOULD HAVE FELT OUT OF PLACE IN THE COLLECTION, BUT THEY WERE A FUN SURPRISE AND ACTUALLY ENDED UP LOOKING INEVITABLE. YOU WORK WITH OX BONE, BRONZE, PLYWOOD… MATERIALS WITH TEXTURE. IS ANYTHING A NO-NO? COLOUR, SAY, OR UPHOLSTERY? NEVER SAY NEVER. I AM ATTRACTED TO THE PERVERSE CHALLENGE OF USING SOMETHING THAT FEELS WRONG. ARE YOU WORKING ON ANY NEW PIECES RIGHT NOW? THE GREAT THING ABOUT FURNITURE IS THAT THE LUST FOR NEWNESS ISN’T AS URGENT AS IT IS WITH FASHION. WE ARE IN A FRENZY OF PRODUCTION, BUT WE ARE TAKING OUR TIME TO MAKE NEW THINGS. DO YOU PLAN TO EXPAND ON YOUR MAISON/OBJETS HOMEWARE? ONE CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH VASES, AND WE ARE STARTING WORK WITH PORPHYRY AND BASALT. YOU REVEAL IN THE BOOK THAT YOUR FIRST PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS A COUCH BOUGHT FROM THE SALVATION ARMY FOR $25. YOU COVETED ART DECO MASTERS SUCH AS MS EILEEN GREY AND MR ÉMILE-JACQUES RUHLMANN, BUT YOU COULDN’T AFFORD THEM SO YOU “SET OUT FAKING IT”. WHAT SORT OF ART AND FURNITURE DO YOU COLLECT NOW? I RARELY BUY ANYTHING CONTEMPORARY. IT’S USUALLY ART NOUVEAU OR VIENNA SECESSIONIST PIECES. I JUST BOUGHT SOME HEADS FROM ITALIAN FUTURIST ARTISTS RENATO BERTELLI AND THAYAHT. IN THE BOOK YOU GIVE MUCH CREDIT TO YOUR WIFE FOR THE FURNITURE. WHO CONCEIVES THE IDEAS, YOU, MICHÈLE OR BOTH OF YOU TOGETHER? I USUALLY COME UP WITH SHAPES AND HUN HAS MODELS MADE IN FOAM THAT WE ADJUST TOGETHER. THE SHAPES SHE ISN’T ATTRACTED TO DON’T MAKE THE EDIT. IT IS A WAY TO PLAY TOGETHER. WOULD YOU TAKE A NEXT STEP INTO ARCHITECTURE? I AM TOO MUCH OF A FANBOY OF CARLO SCARPA, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, RICHARD NEUTRA AND MARCEL BREUER. AND BUILDINGS TAKE TOO LONG. FOR BETTER OR WORSE, I DECIDED TO CONSTRUCT MY LIFE’S WORK IN FASHION. I DON’T HAVE TIME TO TELL A FULLY RESOLVED STORY WITH ARCHITECTURE. BUT HUN LIKES CONSTRUCTING TEMPORARY FORT-LIKE SPACES SHE REFERS TO AS BARGES. NEXT WEEK, TO COINCIDE WITH THE OPENING OF THE VENICE BIENNALE, SHE WILL CONSTRUCT A BARGE ON THE ROOFTOP OF A WAREHOUSE OVERLOOKING THE WATER, WHERE WE ALWAYS SPEND THE SUMMER. THERE WILL BE FOOD, PEOPLE, ART AND BOXING. SHE LIKES HOSTING SALONS AND MIXING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I JUST LIKE STOPPING IN AND THEN WAITING FOR HER AT HOME.

MAKE YOUR WAY UP THE COLOSSAL CONCRETE STAIRWELL, AND THERE ARE GEOMETRIC MARBLE CHAIRS PUZZLED BETWEEN SILVER RACKS FILLED WITH LEATHER JACKETS, FUNNEL-NECK DRESSES, AND ASYMMETRICAL TANKS. IT’S THE PERFECT CONVERGENCE OF FASHION AND FURNITURE, WITH EVERYTHING SINGLE-HANDEDLY CRAFTED BY OWENS. AND WHILE HE’S BEST KNOWN FOR CONSTRUCTING IMAGINATIVE GOTHWEAR, OWENS’S CREATIVITY ALSO EXPANDS INTO JUST-AS-INVENTIVE FURNITURE DESIGN. WHAT STARTED AS A HOBBY WITH HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, SOON TRANSFORMED INTO A FULL-FLEDGED COLLECTION OF ANTLER CHAIRS, BARK TABLES, AND MARBLE PLINTHS THAT ORIGINALLY OCCUPIED HIS PALAIS BOURBON HOME IN PARIS, AS ILLUSTRATED IN HIS RECENTLY RELEASED TOME, RICK OWENS FURNITURE (RIZZOLI, $60). AD CAUGHT UP WITH THE DESIGNER AT HIS MANHATTAN FLAGSHIP TO DISCUSS HIS INTERIOR INFLUENCES, LOCATION-SPECIFIC DESIGN, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS “ANTI-COZY” CRUSADE. ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST: WHAT INITIALLY INSPIRED YOU TO DESIGN YOUR OWN COLLECTION OF FURNITURE WITH YOUR WIFE, MICHÈLE? RICK OWENS: WE HAD AN EMPTY HOUSE AND THE CREATION OF FURNITURE BECAME LIKE A WONDERFUL HOBBY FOR US AS A COUPLE. IT’S OUR WAY OF PLAYING TOGETHER, AND IT&#39;S A CONSTANT CONVERSATION. WE DIDN’T NEED A FURNITURE BUSINESS, BUT IT BECAME SOMETHING WE ENJOYED, AND EVENTUALLY IT DEVELOPED A LIFE OF ITS OWN. IF YOU WERE ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING AROUND YOUR HOUSE, YOU WOULD, EVEN SOMETHING MUNDANE LIKE A DOORKNOB. THAT’S WHERE WE ARE; WE WANT TO CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WAY WE LIVE. AD: HOW DO YOU WORK TOGETHER? RO: OUR STYLE IS SIMILAR, BUT WE APPROACH THE DESIGN PROCESS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. MICHÈLE IS VERY ORGANIC AND I’M A LITTLE BIT MORE RIGID. FOR EXAMPLE, SHE LIKES TO GAMBLE ON EMERGING ARTISTS TO SEE IF THEY’RE GOING TO LAST, WHEREAS I LIKE ANTIQUES BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MORE VARIABLES LEFT. SHE KIND OF DISRUPTED MY WORLD IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. WE DON’T AGREE ON EVERYTHING AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE HEATED DISCUSSIONS, BUT WE ALWAYS END UP AT THE RIGHT PLACE. AD: HOW DO YOU MERGE YOUR OUTLOOKS INTO A SINGLE FURNISHING, LET ALONE AN ENTIRE HOME? RO: WE DIVIDED THE HOUSES. OUR HOME IN PARIS IS WARM, WHILE IN VENICE THE VIBE IS VERY SEVERE AND CHILLY. IN PARIS, IT’S MORE RELAXED; PEOPLE ARE BRINGING THEIR DOGS OVER AND WE HAVE CATS. BUT WITH THE HOUSE IN ITALY, THERE’S NOT A LOT OF FURNITURE, AND THE FURNITURE THAT IS THERE IS ALL FINNISH ART NOUVEAU. AD: WHAT’S SOMETHING DESIGN-WISE THAT YOU NOTICE WHEN YOU GO INTO OTHER PEOPLE’S HOMES? RO: I HAVE A BIG THING WITH TOILETS. THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST PROSAIC OBJECTS, AND SOMETIMES YOU GO INTO SOMEONE’S HOUSE AND THEY HAVE ART AND HIGH-END FURNITURE, BUT YOU GO INTO THEIR BATHROOM AND SEE A PLASTIC TOILET. HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH A PICASSO AROUND THE CORNER, YET OWN A PLASTIC TOILET? MY TOILETS AT HOME ARE RAW CRYSTAL OR MARBLE, SOMETIMES ONYX. IT DEPENDS ON THE WALL MATERIAL. I’LL USE THE SAME STONE FOR THE TOILET AND BATHROOM WALLS. AD: YOU’VE LIVED IN THE STATES AND NOW EUROPE. HOW HAS YOUR DESIGN AESTHETIC EVOLVED? RO: PARIS IS REALLY CURLY. YOU’RE SURROUNDED BY CLASSICISM AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF BUILDINGS ON TOP OF BUILDINGS ON TOP OF BUILDINGS. WHEN YOU COME TO NEW YORK, IT’S SO LINEAR AND SLEEK. I KIND OF FORGOT WHAT IT IS LIKE HERE. IT TOOK LIVING IN EUROPE TO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT TYPE OF SEVERITY. LIVING IN EUROPE, YOU RISE TO THE OCCASION; THE STANDARDS ARE HIGHER AND THERE’S A SENSE OF POETRY THAT IS DEMANDED. HERE, IT’S MORE ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND POWER. THERE, IT’S POETRY AND ABSTRACTION. AD: HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE YOUR INTERIOR TASTE NOW? RO: IN FASHION, I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY: IF MARLENE DIETRICH FELL IN LOVE WITH FRANKENSTEIN AT A LEATHER BAR. WITH INTERIORS, I’M THINKING OF SOMETHING LIKE AN ART DECO INSTITUTIONAL PRISON. I LOOK TO ARCHITECTS LIKE MARCEL BREUER OR LE CORBUSIER, AND INFLUENCES, SUCH AS FINNISH ART NOUVEAU, MAYAN TEMPLES, AND RELIGIOUS BUILDINGS WITH PROPORTIONS THAT ARE MEANT TO INSPIRE A SPIRITUAL AWE. THEN, I ROUGH IT UP. THERE’S GOT TO BE A SENSE OF CRUDENESS. AD: A LOT OF YOUR FURNITURE LOOKS MORE LIKE BEAUTIFUL SCULPTURES AND ART OBJECTS THAN SOFAS AND CHAIRS. HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR PIECES LIVABLE? RO: IT’S NOT THAT LIVABLE. MY FURNITURE IS ALMOST ANTI-COZY—IT’S SOLID, HEAVY, AND HARD TO MOVE. IF YOU LIKE IT, YOU HAVE TO LIKE IT FOREVER. BUT PEOPLE WHO BUY MY FURNITURE DON’T LIVE IN CONCRETE WAREHOUSES, THEY HAVE A NORMAL HOUSE AND MAYBE HAVE JUST ONE PIECE BECAUSE THEY THINK IT’S ATTRACTIVE. THAT WORKS, TOO. I SEE A LOT OF FURNITURE THAT IS VERY PRACTICAL, AND THE WORLD CERTAINLY NEEDS IT, BUT THERE’S ALSO A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED YOUR VALUES AND HOW YOU LIVE. THERE’S A LOT OF CASUALNESS OUT THERE, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, DON’T YOU WANT LIFE TO BE A LITTLE MORE FORMAL?

A CANDID CHAT WITH RICK OWENS ON THE EVE OF HIS CFDA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD— MAY 30 2017 — BY STEFF YOTKA “DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY PLACE? I’M GOING TO GIVE YOU A TOUR OF MY PLACE. I’M IN VENICE RIGHT NOW. HOW DOES THIS WORK? YOU KNOW I’VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. I FACETIME’D SOMEBODY BEFORE, BUT VERY BRIEFLY,” SAYS RICK OWENS, TAKING OFF HIS GLASSES AND STEPPING ONTO A BALCONY BEAMING WITH SUNLIGHT, BLUE SKIES, AND EVEN BLUER WATER. THE DESIGNER AND I ARE ON HIS SECOND-EVER FACETIME CALL, AND HE’S BROADCASTING LIVE FROM THE DECK OF HIS FLAT IN VENICE, ITALY. HE TAKES HIS IPHONE—AND ME—FROM THE BALCONY TO HIS BEDROOM, PAST A BLACK STONE BATHROOM—“YOU HAVE TO SEE THE BATHROOM!” HE EXCLAIMS—AND THROUGH AN OFFICE WHERE HE’S LINED UP THE SPRING 2018 MENSWEAR COLLECTION HE’S GOING TO BE SHOWING IN PARIS IN JUNE. IT’S A SPECTACULAR SIGHT, BUT WHAT HE REALLY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS MY BROOKLYN APARTMENT AND WHY RIDING THE SUBWAY TO WORK EVERY DAY CAN TAKE ME ANYWHERE FROM 20 MINUTES TO TWO HOURS. “I’M KIND OF FASCINATED BY YOUR SOPHISTICATED URBAN LIFE,” HE SAYS. BY ALL STANDARDS, OWENS’S OWN LIFE IS PLENTY MORE SOPHISTICATED. HE LIVES IN A FORMER COMMUNIST BUILDING IN PARIS’S SEVENTH ARRONDISSEMENT THAT ALSO HOUSES HIS DESIGN STUDIO, AND SPENDS HIS SUMMERS ON VENICE’S LIDO IN ANOTHER ELEGANTLY SPARE PENTHOUSE APARTMENT. BUT IT WASN’T ALWAYS LIKE THIS. OWENS’S LIFE BEGAN IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, A SMALL CITY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. HIS MOTHER IS A RETIRED TEACHER OF MEXICAN HERITAGE; HIS FATHER WAS A CONSERVATIVE SOCIAL WORKER. HE’S DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A CHILD AS “A SMALL-TOWN SISSY.” BUT HE BECAME THE SEXIEST GOTH IN LOS ANGELES, LIVING IN A WAREHOUSE ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH ITS FIRE ESCAPE. (“PERFECT FOR CAPES,” HE ONCE WROTE OF THE ARRANGEMENT.) HE STUDIED PAINTING, WHICH HE QUICKLY TRADED FOR PATTERNMAKING, AND PRODUCED SOME LANGUID MOSTLY BLACK READY-TO-WEAR IN THE ’90S THAT PROPELLED HIM TO HIS FIRST NEW YORK FASHION WEEK SHOW IN 2002, SPONSORED BY VOGUE AND STYLE.COM. HE GOT THERE IN PART BECAUSE HIS ASYMMETRICAL LEATHER JACKETS—YOU KNOW, THE ENDLESSLY KNOCKED-OFF ONES—WERE A RUNAWAY HIT AT BARNEYS NEW YORK. THEN CAME INVESTORS, FOLLOWED BY A TRANSATLANTIC MOVE TO PARIS, WHERE HE’S REMAINED THE ONLY AMERICAN DESIGNER TO CONSISTENTLY SHOW HIS OWN LABEL AT PARIS FASHION WEEK SINCE 2003. THOSE ARE THE FACTS. MORE COMPELLING IS RICK’S GENERAL LOVELINESS. RICK OWENS HAS BEEN UNASHAMEDLY, UNSTOPPABLY RICK SINCE DAY ONE. HE’S AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESSMAN, AN ALCHEMIST OF SILKS AND SKINS, A FURNITURE DESIGNER WITH A THING FOR CONCRETE, A STYLE ICON, AND ALSO THE GUY THAT SUSPENDED A PUNK BAND FROM THE CEILING, PUT A STEP TEAM ON THE CATWALK, HARNESSED MODELS TOGETHER LIKE HANS BELLMER DOLLS, SHOWED D CKS ON THE RUNWAY, AND PRODUCED A SHORT FILM OF HIMSELF SIMULATING INTIMACY WITH A HORSE. HE IS SO HIMSELF, THAT IN RESEARCHING HIS LIFE AND CAREER, I DISCOVERED THAT HE’S USED NOT ONLY THE SAME EXPRESSIONS, BUT ALSO THE SAME OFFHAND WORDS TO DESCRIBE HIMSELF AND HIS WORK FOR 15 YEARS. HE’S NOT LAZY OR GUARDED, HE JUST KNOWS EXACTLY WHO HE IS AND WHAT THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF IS TO US LAYPEOPLE IN OUR T-SHIRTS AND MEDIUM-WASH JEANS. HE ONLY WANTS TO BE HONEST. THE IMPRINT OF RICK OWENS IS FELT THROUGHOUT FASHION. WHEREVER THERE’S AN ODE TO GOTH, A LANGUID BIAS DRAPE, THE LEATHER THROAT OF A BOOT CHOKING UP A THIGH—THAT’S RICK. BUT WHAT HIS IMITATORS CAN’T REPLICATE IS HIS AUTHENTICITY. YOU COULD TAKE AWAY ALL THE CLOTHES, STRIP HIM OF THE CONCRETE BUNKER, ERASE THE FAMOUS CABAL OF FRIENDS, AND YOU’D STILL HAVE RICK AND YOU’D JUST LOVE HIM. EVERYONE WHO’S MET HIM DOES. “AS TIME PASSES, I WANT TO BECOME MORE AND MORE RICK OWENS,” HE TOLD VOGUE IN 2006. “AT THE END OF MY LIFE, I WANT THERE TO BE A THREAD RUNNING THROUGH EVERYTHING I&#39;VE DONE.” ON THE EVE OF HIS GEOFFREY BEENE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA, THE DESIGNER REFLECTS ON HIS CAREER AND THE AMERICAN SPIRIT THAT MADE AND KEEPS HIM A SUCCESS. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO BE RECOGNIZED BY AMERICAN FASHION’S GOVERNING BODY? THE CFDA IS PRETTY MUCH THE TOP OF THE HEAP, NOT JUST TO AMERICANS, BUT INTERNATIONALLY. IT’S QUITE A SURPRISE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. IT’S NOT DELIBERATE; I HAVE NEVER REALLY PARTICIPATED IN THAT WORLD—AND I ALWAYS CALL IT “THAT WORLD,” BUT OBVIOUSLY I AM A PART OF IT. I’VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF MORE KIND OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES. WELL, NO, THAT’S STUPID ISN’T IT? BECAUSE I’VE DONE SOME VERY PROVOCATIVE FASHION SHOWS. I DO ALL SORTS OF INTERVIEWS ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND I DO VIDEOS WHERE I’M, LIKE, FIST-F CKING AND HORSE-F CKING, SO I MEAN IT’S NOT LIKE I’M THAT QUIET. I’M DEFINITELY OUT THERE. IT’S SILLY FOR ME TO SAY THAT, BUT I ALWAYS DID FEEL THAT I WAS KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THAT [MAINSTREAM]. I’M VERY NICHE, AND I WAS ALWAYS OKAY WITH THAT. I HAVE THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS: I HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RECOGNITION FOR WHAT I DO, BUT IT’S ALSO NOT OVERWHELMING RECOGNITION. IT’S NOT LIKE I’M OBLIGATED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT I DON’T WANT TO DO. BEING RECOGNIZED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT—AND THAT’S WHAT THIS IS, AND I’M NOT SAYING THAT WITH ANY DISRESPECT. I LOVE ESTABLISHMENT. ALL OF THE BOOKS THAT I’M READING ARE ABOUT CULTURAL ESTABLISHMENTS, ABOUT CULTURAL REVOLUTIONS, THAT EVENTUALLY BECAME [THE] ESTABLISHMENT. RIGHT NOW I’M READING ABOUT MARTIN MUNKÁCSI, HE’S A PHOTOGRAPHER AND IF YOU LOOK AT HIS PHOTOGRAPHY, ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY KNOCKED HIM OFF. IN THE ‘30S HE WORKED WITH CARMEL SNOW AND AVEDON. HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS REVOLUTIONARY AND THEN HE BECAME ESTABLISHMENT. I’M ALWAYS FASCINATED BY THOSE BIOGRAPHIES OF HOW PEOPLE MOVE CULTURE FORWARD. CULTURE ALWAYS MOVES FORWARD IN CYCLES WITH PEOPLE REACTING AGAINST IT AND THEN BECOMING IT. I’M FALLING IN THERE SOMEWHERE. I’M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT DEGREE I’M AT RIGHT NOW, BUT BEING RECOGNIZED, THAT’S INCREDIBLY VALIDATING. THE FASHION INDUSTRY IN NEW YORK CITY IS A LOT MORE INTENSE THAN ANYTHING THAT I’VE EVER HAD TO EXPERIENCE, SO THAT’S WHY BEING RECOGNIZED BY THE CFDA IS JUST ASTONISHING, TOO. I REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THIS IS THE PINNACLE OF AESTHETIC CULTURE AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY AND I’VE BEEN INVITED TO BE A PART OF IT. THAT’S VERY MOVING. DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE’S A CERTAIN AMERICANNESS TO YOUR DESIGNS OR YOUR DESIGN PROCESS? WHAT I’VE ALWAYS SAID IS THAT I FEEL THAT WHAT I’VE DONE IS I’VE TAKEN AMERICAN BLUNTNESS TO EUROPEAN COMPLEXITY. IF YOU READ PROUST—I DON’T MEAN TO SOUND POMPOUS; I’VE NEVER READ IT COMPLETELY. I SPEAK NO FRENCH, BUT FROM WHAT I’VE TRIED TO READ, YOU CAN JUST SEE THE COMPLEXITY IN THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS CONSTRUCTED. THAT INFLUENCES THE WAY YOU THINK, AND BEING IN A COUNTRY THAT IS THAT DENSE WITH HISTORY IS JUST AUTOMATICALLY COMPLEX. AMERICANS HAVE A REPUTATION FOR BEING A LOT MORE FORTHRIGHT AND DIRECT. I’VE ALWAYS ADMIRED THAT INTELLECTUAL COMPLEXITY, BUT I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO INTERPRET IT IN MY OWN BLUNT AMERICAN WAY. THAT’S BEEN MY SCHTICK ALL THIS TIME. I’VE ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING AT EUROPEAN CULTURE FROM THE 1930S AND APPLYING MY SCOTCH TAPE, BRÂNCUȘI, PUNK ROCK AESTHETIC TO IT. SO YES, THE AMERICANNESS DID SERVE ME VERY WELL, AND I’VE USED IT IN A CALCULATING WAY. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE’S ALSO AN AMERICANNESS TO THE WAY YOU’VE STRUCTURED YOUR BUSINESS? I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S THAT AMERICAN. YOU MEAN BY MOVING TO EUROPE AND BEING INDEPENDENT? AND THE WAY THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT COLLECTIONS THAT HIT DIFFERENT PRICE POINTS AND THE COLLABORATIONS WITH ADIDAS. IS THAT DIFFERENT? ISN’T THAT KIND OF WHAT EVERYBODY DOES? EVERYBODY DOESN’T SEEM TO BE DOING IT AS SUCCESSFULLY AS YOU ARE. REALLY? THE WAY WE’VE PROGRESSED HAS BEEN ONE LOGICAL STEP AFTER ANOTHER. IT’S NOT LIKE WE’VE EVER REALLY TRIED TO BITE OFF MORE THAN WE COULD CHEW. LET ME PREFACE THIS BY SAYING THAT I BY NO MEANS AM A BUSINESS GENIUS. I HAVE BUSINESS GENIUSES AS PARTNERS, WHO ARE MORE TALENTED THAN I AM. IT TAKES A CERTAIN KIND OF BALANCE, PATIENCE, AND FINESSE TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WITH WHAT WE’VE GOT. THESE ARE THE SAME PARTNERS THAT I’VE HAD FOR 15 YEARS NOW. MY WHOLE THING WAS I WAS JUST GOING TO WORK ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, AND I WAS JUST GOING TO DO MY THING FOREVER, COME HELL OR HIGH WATER, AND I WAS JUST GOING TO BE POOR. I’VE ALWAYS SAID THAT I WANTED TO BE CHARLES JAMES. I WANTED TO BE THIS ROMANTIC HERO, HAVING STUCK TO MY VISION, DYING IN SQUALOR, LEAVING BEHIND ALL OF THESE BEAUTIFUL ARCHIVES. MY OWN BUSINESS PLAN WAS THAT I WAS JUST GOING TO KEEP MAKING THINGS AND KEEP STICKING TO MY AESTHETIC UNTIL I RAN INTO SOMEBODY WHO COULD HELP. TALK ABOUT SIMPLISTIC—THERE’S NOTHING MORE NAIVE THAN THAT BUSINESS PLAN. IT ACTUALLY KIND OF WORKED. I MET SOME ITALIAN DISTRIBUTORS WHO WANTED TO START SOMETHING ON THEIR OWN, AND THIS WAS, I THINK KEY. I THINK I ENDED UP WITH PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO DO THEIR OWN PROJECT. THEY WEREN’T OVERSATURATED WITH A MILLION DESIGNERS, AND THEY WERE EVERY BIT AS DRIVEN AS I WAS TO SUCCEED BECAUSE THEY HAD SOMETHING TO PROVE AT THE EXACT SAME TIME THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO PROVE. I’VE BEEN VERY LUCKY; I DON’T THINK THAT OPPORTUNITY COMES UP FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. I CRINGE WHEN I THINK OF WHAT SOME OF THESE DESIGNERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH GROUPS WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF VOICES, AND A LOT OF PERSONALITIES. WOW. THAT’S WHY I FEEL LIKE I’M LIVING IN THIS DIFFERENT WORLD, BECAUSE I’M KIND OF LIKE A COUNTRY MOUSE. WE HAVE A LITTLE MOM-AND-POP OPERATION IN OUR VILLAGE, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE GO TO THE BIG CITY TO SELL OUR APPLES, AND THEN WE COME BACK HOME AND JUST KEEP ON CULTIVATING WHAT WE DO. HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA INFORMS YOUR WORK TODAY? FOR SOMEBODY WHO FELT VICTIMIZED WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER, BEING ABLE TO CONTROL MENACE AND MANIPULATE MENACE AND PLAY WITH MENACE, THAT’S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT’S STAYED WITH ME FROM MY YOUTH. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE REFER TO ME AS BEING DARK, BUT EVERYBODY’S DARK. EVERYBODY LOVES A LITTLE BIT OF MENACE. LOOK AT ALL THOSE MOVIES ABOUT FEAR AND PEOPLE PURSUING EACH OTHER AND DESTROYING EACH OTHER. MENACE IS A PART OF EVERYBODY’S LIFE. THEN THERE’S THE WHOLE THING OF RULES, THAT WAS THE OTHER PART OF THE VICTIMIZATION. BEING A FLAMBOYANT KID IN A SMALL TOWN, THERE WERE A LOT OF RULES ABOUT WHAT WAS THE PROPER WAY FOR A PERSON TO BEHAVE. THERE WAS A LOT OF JUDGING. THAT MADE ME REACT VERY STRONGLY, AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO. AT FIRST IT WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE; NOW IT’S MORE GENTLE. NOW I LIKE TO TEASE THE RULES A LITTLE BIT. WHAT IF WE LOOSENED UP THE RULES A LITTLE BIT? WHAT IF WE TRIED SOMETHING ELSE? DO YOU FEEL ANY MORE OR LESS AMERICAN NOW AFTER HAVING LIVED IN PARIS FOR 15 OR SO YEARS? NO. I THINK THERE’S SO MUCH DIVISIVENESS BETWEEN WHAT COUNTRY PEOPLE BELONG TO, WHAT COUNTRY PEOPLE SHOULD STAY IN, AND WHAT COUNTRY OTHER PEOPLE DON’T WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN TO THAT I JUST WANT TO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF US LIVING IN ONE BIG CITY CALLED THE WORLD. THAT SOUNDS REALLY DUMB, BUT I DO. HOW CAN I HELP PEOPLE THINK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, NOT IN TERMS OF BORDERS? I FEEL BORDERLESS IN A WAY. I FEEL LIKE I COULD JUST AS EASILY BECOME COMFORTABLE ANYWHERE, BUT I WOULD STILL BE DOING THE SAME THING. I WOULD STILL BE CREATING MY OWN LITTLE BUBBLE, SO FOR SOMEBODY THAT WANTS OPEN BORDERS EVERYWHERE, I DEFINITELY HAVE MY OWN PERSONAL BORDERS. [OWENS PAUSES.] DOING INTERVIEWS IS A WEIRD THING BECAUSE I ALWAYS TRY TO BE HONEST, AND I’VE REPEATED SO MANY THINGS THAT I FEEL KIND OF LIKE A DOUCHE, LIKE I’M REPEATING THINGS THAT PEOPLE KNOW. THEN I THINK, WELL, IT’S ARROGANT TO THINK THAT EVERY PERSON ON THE PLANET HAS READ EVERY INTERVIEW THAT I’VE GIVEN. BUT PEOPLE READING VOGUEPROBABLY HAVE AN IDEA OF ALL OF THIS STUFF, AND THEY MIGHT THINK I DON’T HAVE ANYTHING FRESH TO SAY. NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS MY WHOLE STORY, SO A LITTLE BIT OF REPEATING ISN’T GOING TO KILL ANYBODY. BEFORE, NOBODY KNEW ME AND I WAS ABLE TO SURPRISE EVERYBODY WITH EVERYTHING. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU REPEAT YOURSELF. AND I AM ALWAYS STRUCK BY YOUR CANDIDNESS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR LIFE. THAT’S RARE. IF I CAN DO ANYTHING, IT’S THAT THERE ARE VALUES THAT I WANT TO PROMOTE AND I HAVE A PLATFORM TO PROMOTE THE VALUES THAT I BELIEVE IN. THOSE VALUES ARE KINDNESS, COMMUNITY, TOLERANCE, ACCEPTANCE, AND SELF-ACCEPTANCE, WHICH IS A BIG THING FOR ALL OF US, ACCEPTING YOUR LIMITATIONS, ACCEPTING WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO WORK WITH, AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT. IF I CAN PROMOTE THOSE THINGS I FEEL LIKE I’M DOING THE RIGHT THING. DOING THE RIGHT THING IS IMPORTANT, AND PROMOTING THE IDEA OF DOING THE RIGHT THING. I CAN ALSO USE MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE. ADMITTING FLAWS AND THINGS THAT I’M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ABOUT MYSELF AND MY VULNERABILITIES, I THINK THAT’S A GOOD THING. I THINK THAT SEEMS HEALTHY—BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO OVERSHARE. [LAUGHS] SOMETIMES WHEN I READ INTERVIEWS, I FEEL LIKE I SOUND A LITTLE TOO OPINIONATED AND A LITTLE TOO STRIDENT. I DON’T WANT THAT EITHER. THERE’S ENOUGH STRIDENT OPINION IN THE WORLD. WITH THE SHOWS AND THE CLOTHES THAT I DO, I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE OTHER AESTHETIC OPTIONS TO START WITH, AND THAT OPENING UP AESTHETIC OPTIONS CAN LEAD TO OTHER OPTIONS, TOO. THAT’S NOT A BAD START. IT’S A GOOD MESSAGE. DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD EVER RETURN TO AMERICA FULL-TIME? I HAVE NO IDEA. THE MOVE TO EUROPE WAS REALLY A TECHNICAL ONE. I STARTED MANUFACTURING IN EUROPE, JUST BECAUSE THAT’S WHO FOUND ME. LIVING IN L.A., I HAD TO GO BACK AND FORTH AND I JUST COULDN’T KEEP UP. IT MADE MORE SENSE [TO LIVE IN EUROPE] IF I WAS GOING TO WORK IN ITALY. ALSO, I HAD SO MUCH TO LEARN THAT I HAD TO STAY IN THE FACTORY A LOT IN THE BEGINNING. I HAD TO BE THERE A LOT, AND I STILL DO. THERE WAS A MOMENT A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE I THOUGHT, I CAN PHONE IT IN NOW. I CAN WORK FROM PARIS, I CAN HAVE MY STUDIO THERE AND I DON’T HAVE TO GO TO THE FACTORY ANYMORE. I TRIED AND IT JUST DIDN’T WORK. I DIDN’T FEEL THE CONNECTION, I DIDN’T FEEL LIKE I HAD MY HANDS IN THE DIRT ENOUGH. THERE IS A CERTAIN SPONTANEITY IN BEING IN A FACTORY WITH ALL OF THOSE FABRICS, ALL OF THE CUTTERS, AND BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING IN 10 MINUTES. I’M NOT THE MOST SPONTANEOUS GUY IN THE WORLD AT ALL, BUT HAVING OPTIONS IS A GREAT THING. THAT’S WHY I LIVE IN EUROPE, BECAUSE I HAD TO MAKE IT WORK HERE. I’VE ALWAYS LOVED EUROPE; I JUST NEVER DREAMED I WOULD LIVE HERE. ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS SUCH A SINGULAR PERSPECTIVE AND OPERATES ON YOUR OWN TERMS THAT YOU’VE ACHIEVED SUCH A CULT FOLLOWING AND HAVE SUCH A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS? WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? I DON’T KNOW. HOW DID THAT WORK? DO YOU KNOW? I HAVE A HUNCH BUT I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK FIRST. I DON’T HAVE A THEORY. I DON’T HAVE A THEORY AT ALL. ONE THING I DO HAVE A THEORY ABOUT, ACTUALLY: I THINK OF DONALD JUDD A LOT. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO SAY, YOU NEED TO FOCUS AND CLEAR OUT A LOT OF THE CLUTTER AROUND IT. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO SAY, AND YOU HAVE TO REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, NOT BECAUSE YOU’RE THUMPING PEOPLE OVER THE HEAD WITH IT, BUT BECAUSE YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT IN YOURSELF, BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT. I THINK CONFIDENT REPETITION IS A BIG PART OF WHAT MADE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE ME, BUT ALSO I THINK I GOT EXPOSURE AT A TIME RIGHT BEFORE WE WERE OVERWHELMED WITH EVERYBODY HAVING A LOT OF EXPOSURE. I HAD ENOUGH SPACE AROUND ME AT A POINT IN TIME WHERE PEOPLE COULD REGISTER WHO I WAS. THAT WAS JUST LUCK, JUST BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. OKAY, WHAT’S YOUR THEORY? I AGREE ABOUT THE TIMING, BUT I WOULD ADD THAT THERE’S AN AUTHENTICITY TO YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS THAT PEOPLE, DESPITE HOW CYNICAL THEY MIGHT BE, RELATE TO—AND YOU CAN’T FAKE THAT. PEOPLE WANT TO BELIEVE IN SOMEONE THAT THEY THINK BELIEVES IN THEMSELVES. WELL, THAT’S A LESSON FOR ALL OF US: TELLING THE TRUTH USUALLY WORKS. WE SHOULD POST THAT ON ALL THE BILLBOARDS IN AMERICA. WELL, YEAH. [LAUGHS] WHEN YOU’RE IN EUROPE OR ABROAD AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT’S GOING ON IN AMERICA, DO YOU FEEL DISCONNECTED FROM IT IN ANY WAY? EVERY PLACE IN THE WORLD HAS ITS CRAZY MOMENTS, AND I TEND TO BE A LITTLE MORE FATALISTIC ABOUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS. I THINK IN TERMS OF EONS OF TIME. THERE HAVE BEEN CULTURAL UPHEAVALS AND POLITICAL UPHEAVALS FOREVER. I WAS WATCHING MY CAT TORTURE A MOUSE THE OTHER DAY, AND I WAS THINKING, LIFE IS NOT FAIR, BAD THINGS HAPPEN, AND THEY HAVE TO. THIS IS JUST THE WAY IT IS. CATS ARE GOING TO BE TORTURING MICE FOREVER, LONG AFTER WE’RE DEAD. CONFLICT AND UPHEAVAL ARE NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY. OUR JOB IS TO PROMOTE GOOD ENERGY, AND GRACE, AND BEAUTY. THAT’S WHAT WE’RE ABLE TO ENJOY ONCE ALL OF OUR NEEDS ARE MET. ONCE WE HAVE FED THE CHILDREN AND WE HAVE SHELTER, THE JOY OF BEAUTY AND CREATION, THAT’S WHAT WE’RE ON THE PLANET FOR, SO TO LET THE CHAOS OF CONFLICT AND—DO I SAY THE WORD EVIL? THAT’S A BIT MUCH—TAKE OVER . . . . YOU CAN EITHER HAVE A MORBID FASCINATION WITH THAT OR YOU CAN PUT YOUR ENERGY INTO CREATING POSITIVE ENERGY THAT’S GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. I SOUND VERY ZEN AND VERY NEW AGE, AND I’M NOT. I’M REALLY NOT. THAT’S PART OF WHAT MY LABEL IS ABOUT: I DON’T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT I’M LOOKING. LOOKING FOR THE ANSWERS IS A GREAT THING. CHANGING GEARS: THE CFDA FASHION AWARDS ARE IN A WEEK—DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO WEAR? I’LL WEAR THE SAME THING I ALWAYS WEAR. I ONLY WEAR ONE THING FOR FORMAL OCCASIONS. I JUST PUT ON A JACKET—THAT’S IT. WILL YOU BRING A DATE? MY DATE’S MICHÈLE! I’M BRINGING MY PARTNERS, TOO, SO IT’S JUST THE FOUR OF US. NOTHING TOO SPECIAL. NO CELEBRITY FRIEND, MODEL, OR IT PERSON? MICHÈLE IS MY IT PERSON. WOULDN’T YOU BE DISAPPOINTED IF I CAME WITH A CELEBRITY? WOULDN’T YOU BE GROSSED OUT? YOU WOULD FEEL A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED—I’M SURE YOU WOULD. THAT’S TRUE. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I JUST CAN’T DO. MICHÈLE HAS BECOME SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE FIGURE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. I SEE ON THE INTERNET. SHE IS AN INSPIRING PERSON. SHE’S GOT THIS LIFE FORCE THAT I LOVE THAT PEOPLE HAVE RECOGNIZED. SHE’S BECOME THIS KIND OF STYLE ICON—SHE’S ALWAYS BEEN THAT—BUT PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO HER NOW. SO, YEAH, SHE’S MY IT GIRL. THAT’S EASY. AND MICHÈLE WILL PRESENT YOU WITH THE AWARD. WHY HER? SOMEONE WAS ASKING ME ABOUT PRESENTERS, AND I SAID I HAD CONSIDERED MICHÈLE AT THE BEGINNING, BUT THAT WAS PROBABLY TOO INSULAR. IT FELT LIKE IT WOULDN’T BE IN THE RIGHT SPIRIT OF PARTICIPATING IN THEIR EVENT. WHEN I DO THESE THINGS, I THINK I’M A GUEST IN THEIR HOUSE, SO I’M NOT GOING TO REARRANGE THEIR FURNITURE, I’M GOING TO RESPECT THEIR VIBE. THEN I THOUGHT, NO, THE MOST HONEST THING WOULD BE TO [ACKNOWLEDGE] THAT THE WHOLE REASON THAT I’M HERE IS BECAUSE I AM INSULAR AND BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY CLOSE-KNIT, VERY INTIMATE ORGANIZATION, AND IT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. A LITTLE ROMANCE DOESN’T HURT EITHER. I THINK THAT’S A GOOD MESSAGE TO SHARE. I MEAN, I’M NOT GIVING HER A FREE DRESS—WELL, YES, I AM! [LAUGHS] NO, SHE PAID FOR IT IN HER OWN WAY. LAST QUESTION: WHAT, WHO, OR WHERE DO YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU THINK OF HOME? PARIS, BUT THAT COULD CHANGE. IF I NEEDED TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE, HOME COULD BE ANYWHERE. IT’S ONLY PARIS BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE I AM NOW. REMEMBER: NO BORDERS, NO BORDERS, NO BORDERS. THIS INTERVIEW HAS BEEN EDITED AND CONDENSED.

THE CULT DESIGNER, KNOWN FOR HIS GOTHTINGED MINIMALISM, HAS RUN HIS COMPANY WITH THE SAME PARTNERS FOR THE BETTER PART OF TWO DECADES, AND SAYS COMPROMISE IS NOT PART OF HIS VOCABULARY. JUST DON’T TELL HIS THREE BENGAL CATS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ON THE TERRACE OF HIS PARIS HOME AND HEADQUARTERS, A FIVE-STORY BUILDING ADJOINING THE GARDENS OF THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, THE YOUNGER PAIR — HORTENSE AND MILO — JUMPED FREELY ON AND OFF HIS LAP AS HE SPOKE. “IT’S LIKE A LITTLE PACK OF CHEETAHS IN THE HOUSE — MINIATURE CHEETAHS,” OWENS SAID WITH A SMILE. DOTTING THE OUTDOOR SPACE WERE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF HIS MASSIVE SCULPTURAL FURNITURE, THE SUBJECT OF A RECENT EXHIBITION AT THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN LOS ANGELES AND A BOOK PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI. “IT’S THE SAME AESTHETIC APPLIED TO EVERYTHING AROUND ME. IF I COULD CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING ON THE ROUTE BETWEEN MY HOUSE AND MY GYM, I WOULD,” HE EXPLAINED. A FEW FEET AWAY, THE DESIGNER’S WIFE AND MUSE, MICHÈLE LAMY, PACED BACK AND FORTH WHILE TALKING TO A SEATED COLLEAGUE. OWENS HOLDS A MAJORITY STAKE IN HIS COMPANY, OWENSCORP, WITH A SMALLER PERCENTAGE HELD BY ITS COFOUNDERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS ELSA LANZO AND LUCA RUGGERI, WHO HOLD THE POSITIONS OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY. THE BRAND REGISTERED REVENUES OF AROUND $120 MILLION LAST YEAR, AND ALTHOUGH OWENS ADMITS HE HAS BEEN TEMPTED TO SELL IT TO A LARGER GROUP, HE IS GRATEFUL IT DIDN’T HAPPEN. “IF I THINK OF HAVING TO EXPLAIN MYSELF OR MAKE COMMITTEE DECISIONS, IT WOULD KILL ME,” HE SAID. EVEN SO, HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN REACHING A MASS AUDIENCE, THANKS TO THE SNEAKERS HE HAS DESIGNED WITH ADIDAS SINCE 2013, AND A CELEBRITY FAN BASE THAT RANGES FROM TRENDSETTERS INCLUDING KANYE WEST AND A$AP ROCKY TO FELLOW DESIGNERS LIKE DONNA KARAN, VICTORIA BECKHAM AND VERA WANG. BACK WHEN OWENS MOVED TO PARIS IN 2003, HE HAD JUST BEEN AWARDED THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA’S PERRY ELLIS AWARD FOR EMERGING TALENT. AT THE CFDA AWARDS ON JUNE 5, LAMY IS TO PRESENT HIM WITH THE GEOFFREY BEENE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. A RETROSPECTIVE AT MILAN’S TRIENNALE DESIGN MUSEUM, BOWING IN DECEMBER, WILL FURTHER SEAL HIS CULTURAL MOMENT. TAKING STOCK OF HIS BANNER YEAR, OWENS SPOKE TO WWD ABOUT BREAKING THE RULES, HITTING THE RED CARPET AT THE MET BALL AND HIS PLANS FOR A BOOK ABOUT LARRY LEGASPI, THE COSTUME DESIGNER FOR KISS. WWD: WERE YOU ALWAYS CLEAR THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO WAS FASHION, OR WAS IT DESIGN IN A BROADER SENSE? RICK OWENS: IT WAS AN AESTHETIC PURSUIT. I WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST, BUT I WASN’T REALLY CONFIDENT IN MY INTELLECTUAL STAMINA FOR IT. I WAS MORE INTIMIDATED BY IT, AND SO FASHION WAS KIND OF THE NEXT BEST THING. IT WAS EASIER. NOW, I’M A LITTLE BIT JADED ABOUT THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN TO BE AN ARTIST AND I WONDER, IN A WAY, IF FASHION HAS SURPASSED ART INTELLECTUALLY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RESPOND QUICKER. IT’S MORE OF A CONVERSATION, AND ARTISTS CAN INDULGE IN THEIR OWN PERSONAL VISION AND TAKE A LONG TIME ABOUT IT, AND THEY CAN MILK IT, WHEREAS IN THE DESIGN WORLD, YOU HAVE A SYSTEM AND YOU HAVE TO RESPOND A LOT MORE BRISKLY. I THINK THE FASHION WORLD HAS GOTTEN AS SOPHISTICATED AS THE ART WORLD EVER WAS. WWD: YOUR SHOWS MAKE A POWERFUL STATEMENT EVERY SEASON. HOW DO YOU CONCEIVE THEM? R.O.: I WANT TO PRESENT A FASHION SHOW THAT I WANT TO GO SEE. IT’S THE MOST SELFISH THING, AND ALSO IT’S A CHALLENGE. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT BEING IN FASHION IS THAT IT’S LIKE A PUZZLE THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT FOUR TIMES A YEAR. I HAVE THESE RESOURCES, I HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF TIME TO DO IT, TO EXECUTE THEM IN: HOW DO I GET A PRECISE, CONCISE, FRESH EXPRESSION EXECUTED IN THAT TIME? I KIND OF LIKE THAT PUZZLE. I GUESS THERE’S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STRESS, BUT I THINK ALSO WHEN THERE’S STRESS, YOU RISE TO THE OCCASION AND IT’S A LUXURY TO HAVE THAT KIND OF STRESS. BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF AND TO BE HAVING THAT FORUM, WHO CAN COMPLAIN? WWD: YOU OFTEN ADDRESS SERIOUS ISSUES SUCH AS RACISM AND INEQUALITY. R.O.: TALKING ABOUT BEAUTIFUL HAIR AND MAKEUP IS A LITTLE PREDICTABLE. BUT BEING ABLE TO TALK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR OR ASPIRATIONS OR BEAUTIFUL URGES, IT’S JUST OTHER BEAUTIFUL THINGS TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT, JUST BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY. WWD: I’M INTRIGUED BY YOUR VOCABULARY. IN THE SHOW NOTES FOR YOUR “GLITTER” MEN’S AND WOMEN’S FALL SHOWS, YOU PIT PROVOCATIVE, CHALLENGING, UNDERGROUND THEMES AGAINST NOTIONS OF ELEGANCE AND COMMUNITY. R.O.: I’M SAYING THAT THEY CAN COEXIST, AND I’M SAYING THAT THEY BELONG TOGETHER. HUMOR IS A BIG PART OF THAT. GLITTER WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HUMOR TO START WITH. IT’S CAMP AND IT’S FUN, AND IT’S ABOUT NOT TAKING YOURSELF SERIOUSLY. NOT TAKING YOURSELF SERIOUSLY IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEGANT THINGS IN THE WORLD. BEING ABLE TO RESPOND WELL TO ADVERSITY: THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST GRACEFUL THINGS WE CAN DO, SO I THINK THEY ALL FIT TOGETHER. WWD: A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GONE DOWN A MORE OBVIOUS ROUTE OF PUTTING A SLOGAN ON A T-SHIRT. THE WAY YOU DO IT REQUIRES THE VIEWER TO THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE MORE. R.O.: IT’S JUST MORE FUN, AND IT’S MORE MYSTERIOUS AND IT’S MORE MAGICAL THAN JUST HAVING SOMETHING BROADCAST TO YOU. BUT I GET IT — I MEAN, IT’S A VERY BUSY WORLD AND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE A POINT. I MEAN, I LOVE GETTING TO THE POINT, SO I DON’T DISAPPROVE OF THAT KIND OF STUFF. EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN APPROACH. WWD: WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE INDUSTRY’S SOUL-SEARCHING ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE FASHION SHOW, AND THE RELEVANCE OF SEE-NOW-BUY-NOW? R.O.: DO WE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE TEENAGER ON THE PLANET? NO, I DON’T THINK WE DO. I THINK THERE’S PEOPLE THAT CAN NOT ONLY TOLERATE A SLOWER PACE, BUT RESPECT IT. THE WHOLE FAST THING, IT’S ABOUT MAKING THINGS DISPOSABLE. THAT’S A WORLD THAT HAS ITS PLACE, IT’S FINE. I ALWAYS HATE TO SOUND LIKE I KNOW EVERYTHING AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS. I AVOID MAKING JUDGMENTS, BUT I KNOW THE SYSTEM THAT I WANT TO FOLLOW. WWD: SO DO YOU THINK THE SOLUTION IS FOR DESIGNERS TO BE MORE COMMITTED TO WHAT THEY STAND FOR? R.O.: I DON’T THINK THERE’S A SOLUTION. I THINK EVERYBODY HAS TO DO IT THEIR OWN WAY. YOU KNOW, I RESPECT DESIGNERS WHO ORCHESTRATE THESE HUGE THINGS, THESE HUGE FORCES. I THINK THAT’S OF GREAT VALUE TOO, ECONOMICALLY AND EVEN AESTHETICALLY. I DON’T THINK THAT THERE’S A RIGHT WAY OR A WRONG WAY, BUT I THINK IT’S A DIFFERENT SET OF SKILLS, AND THERE’S A SET OF SKILLS THERE THAT I DON’T HAVE. I WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO IT’S PAINTING WITH A DIFFERENT BRUSH. IT’S EXPRESSIONISM VERSUS CUBISM. WWD: HOW HAS SOCIAL MEDIA CHANGED FASHION? R.O.: OBVIOUSLY, IT’S TURNED IT INTO A BIG ORGY, BUT YOU KNOW, WHO DOESN’T LOVE AN ORGY, SO IS THAT A BAD THING? IT’S EVOLUTION, AND TO DISAPPROVE OF THAT KIND OF THING IS JUST SILLY. IT’S FASCINATING. WHO WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THIS? WHO WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FASHION TO TURN INTO THIS? BUT THERE’S EBBS AND FLOWS TO THESE KINDS OF THINGS. IT’S EXCITING WHEN THINGS ACCELERATE AND THERE’S AN ELEMENT OF RISK AND THERE’S THE THRILL OF CRASHING. SO ALL OF THAT’S THERE, AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY INTERESTING. WWD: WHEN YOU DESIGN, DO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW IT’S GOING TO PLAY ON INSTAGRAM? R.O.: I’M NOT THAT MUCH OF AN INSTAGRAM PERSON, SO IT’S NOT MY COMFORT LEVEL, REALLY. BUT I KNOW THAT AFTER A WHILE, I COULD UNDERSTAND IT SO MUCH BETTER WHEN I TOOK A PICTURE OF IT AND ANALYZED THE PICTURE, AND I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT WORKED. AND I COULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO A TOILE, COMPARE IT TO THE PICTURE BEFORE AND IT MADE IT A LOT MORE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR ME. BUT I’VE ALWAYS WORKED IN BLACK AND WHITE. I LIKE BEING ABLE TO SEE THE LINES AND THE VOLUMES AND THE SILHOUETTE MORE CLEARLY, AND HOMOGENIZING ALL OF THE IMAGES SO THAT THEY GO TOGETHER. WWD: I READ THAT WHEN YOU STARTED MAKING SNEAKERS, YOU ALSO DID IT IN AN EXPERIMENTAL, INSTINCTIVE WAY. AND NOW, OF COURSE, YOU’RE THE KING OF SNEAKERS. HOW DID THAT EVOLVE? R.O.: THE FUNNY THING IS WHEN I STARTED WITH THE SNEAKERS, I COULDN’T STAND SNEAKERS. I THOUGHT SNEAKERS WERE THE MOST BANAL, COMMON, CONVENTIONAL THING. THEY IRRITATED ME. AND THEN I STARTED GOING TO THE GYM A LOT, AND IT WAS SILLY GOING IN MY BIG, BLACK BOOTS — WHICH I DID FOR YEARS — SO MY ORIGINAL SNEAKERS ACTUALLY WERE A BIT OF A PARODY. I WANTED TO EXAGGERATE THEM AND MAKE THEM OVER-THE-TOP SO THAT THEY COULD KIND OF FIT INTO MY MORE THEATRICAL WORLD. I DID THEM, AND I DIDN’T EXPECT MUCH OF A RESPONSE. I LEARNED HOW A SOMEWHAT EFFORTLESS MOVE COULD INTRODUCE ME TO A VERY BIG AUDIENCE. IS A BIGGER AUDIENCE AUTOMATICALLY BETTER? I’M NOT EXACTLY SURE, BUT I DO KNOW I HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCTS WE HAVE MADE TOGETHER. WWD: WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO RECEIVE THE CFDA’S GEOFFREY BEENE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD? THE LAST TIME YOU RECEIVED AN AWARD FROM THEM, IT WAS THE PERRY ELLIS AWARD FOR EMERGING TALENT IN 2002. DOES THIS MEAN YOU ARE JOINING THE PANTHEON OF THE ESTABLISHMENT? R.O.: I WOULD HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL LIFE WITHOUT IT — I MEAN, I’M VERY GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE — BUT IT IS VERY VALIDATING, HAVING THAT KIND OF RECOGNITION, AND I LOVE BEING PART OF AESTHETIC HISTORY. THAT SOUNDS REALLY LOFTY, AND I DON’T MEAN IT LIKE THAT. IT’S ABOUT BEING PART OF CIVILIZATION, IT’S ABOUT BEING PART OF THE TIMES THAT WE LIVE IN, HAVING FULLY PARTICIPATED IN CULTURE, BEING RECOGNIZED FOR BEING A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT. I MEAN, THAT’S PRETTY UP THERE. WWD: IT’S INTERESTING THAT YOU’RE SENSITIVE TO THAT, BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE A STRONG TASTE FOR PROVOCATION. DO YOU INTENTIONALLY POSITION YOURSELF ON THE FRINGE? R.O.: NO, NO. I JUST QUESTION A LOT OF THINGS. I LOVE AESTHETICS BUT SOMETIMES, THE MARGINS AND THE PARAMETERS OF AESTHETICS CAN BE SO STRICT AND KIND OF SEVERELY POLICED BY PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY OR THE KINDNESS TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES, SO I RESENT THAT. I COMPLETELY RESPECT HISTORY, AND I RESPECT CLASSICISM. IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT MY CLOTHES, IT’S VERY CLASSICAL ELEMENTS, SO I’M PROMOTING CLASSICAL BEAUTY AS MUCH AS I’M QUESTIONING IT. WHAT I’M QUESTIONING ARE CONTEMPORARY RULES. I LIKE QUESTIONING THEM, BUT HOPEFULLY NOT IN AN ANGRY WAY. I ALWAYS WANT IT TO BE GENTLE TEASING, AND I WANT TO BE PLAYFUL ABOUT IT. WWD: MAYBE THIS AWARD IS PROOF — IF ANY WERE NEEDED — THAT YOU CAN DO THINGS ON YOUR OWN TERMS AND SET YOUR OWN PARAMETERS AND STILL GAIN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RESPECT AND ACCEPTANCE. R.O.: AM I PROMOTING ANARCHY AND THE COMPLETE DOWNFALL OF CIVILIZATION [LAUGHS]? “NO RULES FOR ANYBODY!” I MEAN, THERE’S A LOT OF RULES THAT I RESPECT AND THAT I FOLLOW AND THAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN, BUT THEN THERE’S SOME RULES THAT JUST SEEM A LITTLE SILLY SOMETIMES, OR PREDICTABLE. SO IN A SHOW, INSTEAD OF PUTTING WOMEN IN PRECARIOUS HIGH HEELS, INSTEAD OF MAKING THAT PHYSICAL STATEMENT, I HAVE STRONG WOMEN CARRYING EACH OTHER. THAT’S ANOTHER PHYSICAL STATEMENT THAT WE CAN MAKE. IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE ABOUT MAKING THE HEELS HIGHER — WHICH I’VE DONE. I MEAN, ANY TIME I MAKE SOME KIND OF PROCLAMATION, I’VE ALREADY CONTRADICTED MYSELF SOMEWHERE. THAT’S PART OF LIFE. SO I’M JUST KIND OF LOOKING FOR THE ANSWERS TOO, BUT I FEEL LIKE I’M TRYING TO LOOK FOR POSITIVE ANSWERS AND I’M TRYING TO PUT POSITIVE ENERGY OUT THERE. WWD: YOU ATTENDED THE MET BALL FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? R.O.:I WAS DELIGHTED TO GO. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION AND AESTHETICS, THIS IS ONE OF OUR CONTEMPORARY CEREMONIES. I RESPECT THAT. THAT’S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PARTICIPATING AS FULLY AS I CAN IN THE AESTHETIC CULTURE OF OUR GENERATION. I APPRECIATE BEING INCLUDED IN THAT. I KNOW I’M SUPPOSED TO SNEER, OR PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT ME TO SNEER, BUT NO, NOTHING OF THAT. IT WAS LOVELY AND I WAS HAPPY TO BE INVITED, ESPECIALLY FOR [FEATURED DESIGNER REI KAWAKUBO.] IF I WAS GOING TO GO TO A MET COSTUME INSTITUTE THING ONCE IN MY LIFE, IT WOULD BE FOR THAT — BECAUSE THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF UNPREDICTABLE AESTHETICS GETTING THEIR DUE. WWD: ARE YOU INFLUENCED BY REI KAWAKUBO OR ANY OTHER DESIGNERS? R.O.: SURE. I LOVE HER, I LOVE PAUL POIRET, I LOVE MARIANO FORTUNY, I LOVE ADRIAN FROM HOLLYWOOD, I LOVE BOB MACKIE. I THINK HE WAS EVERY BIT AS TALENTED AS ADRIAN, AND HE’S KIND OF AN UNSUNG HERO. I’M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO DO A BOOK ABOUT LARRY LEGASPI. LARRY LEGASPI IN THE SEVENTIES DID THE COSTUMES FOR LABELLE AND FOR KISS AND FOR DIVINE. FIRST OF ALL, I LISTEN TO LABELLE ALMOST EVERY DAY. I USED TO LISTEN TO KISS EVERY DAY. THE PHENOMENON OF KISS’ OUTFITS AND THAT WHOLE TESTOSTERONE-ON-HEELS THING, THAT WAS A HUGE INSPIRATION. AND THEN DIVINE — MY FAVORITE QUOTE: “ADVOCATE CANNIBALISM!” WWD:HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE APPROPRIATION OF YOUR AESTHETIC BY THE CURRENT GENERATION OF ENTERTAINERS LIKE KANYE WEST AND JUSTIN BIEBER? R.O.: WHEN YOU HAVE WHAT YOU CONSIDER A GOOD IDEA, YOU PUT IT OUT THERE AND IF YOU THINK IT’S A GOOD IDEA AND OTHER PEOPLE DO TOO, HOW CAN YOU BE SURPRISED IF IT SPREADS? WHAT KIND OF CONTROL IS APPROPRIATE? AM I SUPPOSED TO GET MONEY FOR IT? IF I DIDN’T GET A BIT OF AUTHORSHIP FROM IT, THEN THAT WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE. BUT I GET AS MUCH CREDIT AS I NEED. IT’S NOTHING I CAN HOLD ONTO FOREVER, ANYWAY. I MEAN, HOW CAN I REPEAT ALL OF THAT STUFF OVER AND OVER FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE? TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I DO, BUT I ALSO HAVE TO MOVE ON. SO I SET IT FREE AND IT’S GROWING UP ON ITS OWN, LIKE YOU WANT YOUR BABIES TO DO. WWD:DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE REACHED THIS CULTURAL RELEVANCE RECENTLY? R.O.: I’M PROBABLY RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PEAK, BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET THAT KIND OF RECOGNITION, YOU CAN’T SUSTAIN SOMETHING FOREVER. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD, BUT EVERYTHING IS A CYCLE. I MEAN, I HAD A GREAT RIDE, AND IT’S NOT LIKE I’M GIVING UP, BUT IF THIS IS AS FAR AS IT WENT — GOD, IT’S AMAZING. WWD: YET YOU ARE EMBARKING ON A WHOLE NEW CHAPTER WITH YOUR FURNITURE LINE, WHICH IS EXPANDING. R.O.: I SHOULDN’T SOUND SO MELANCHOLY. I HAVE MORE MOTIVATION AND VIGOR AND MAYBE MORE RAGE THAN I EVER DID, AND I WANT TO BURN THINGS DOWN AS MUCH AS I EVER DID, IF NOT MORE. WITH THE FURNITURE, I WAS VERY INFLUENCED BY ANTHROPOSOPHICAL FURNITURE. IT WAS VIENNESE, AND IT WAS KIND OF ANTI-BAUHAUS FURNITURE. IN DORNACH IN SWITZERLAND, THERE IS THE GOETHEANUM, A BUILDING DEVOTED TO GOETHE AND THE PURSUIT OF HIS PHILOSOPHY. I LOVE HOW IT WAS KIND OF CULTISH. IT WAS AESTHETICS COMBINED WITH ASPIRATIONAL BEHAVIOR. AND THE FURNITURE THAT THEY WERE PRODUCING, THEIR AESTHETIC WAS ART NOUVEAU, BUT WITH A BRUTALIST INTERPRETATION WHICH IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. WHEN I LOOK AT MY FURNITURE, I’M REALIZING, GOD, I JUST TOTALLY LIFTED FROM THAT. I’M COMPLETELY RIPPING OFF THAT AESTHETIC. AND WHEN I RIP STUFF OFF, I’M HAPPY TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. AND I RIP STUFF OFF ALL THE TIME — WE ALL DO. WWD: ARE THE SCULPTURES MEANT TO BE FUNCTIONAL? R.O.: WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING FURNITURE, MY STATEMENT OF INTENT WAS A FUR ON A ROCK NEXT TO A FIRE IN A CAVE. I WANTED IT TO BE ABOUT REDUCTIVISM AND ABOUT SIMPLICITY AND ABOUT ESSENTIALS. THIS [POINTS TO A CONCRETE BENCH END] BECAME MY SYMBOL OF A ROCK, AND IT’S A FACETED ROCK. IT’S FACETED IN MY PERSONAL LANGUAGE, A PERSONAL LANGUAGE THAT WAS FED BY BRUTALISM, BY WORLD WAR II ARMY BUNKERS, BY MONUMENTALISM, BY LAND ART, BY BRÂNCUSI. ALL OF THE INFLUENCES THAT I’VE EVER HAD ARE KIND OF SUMMARIZED IN THIS SHAPE THAT I OBSESSED OVER. MICHÈLE ENCOURAGED THAT BECAUSE — AND THIS IS KIND OF A LESSON IN LIFE — WHEN YOUR PERSONAL NEEDS ARE MET, YOU’RE ABLE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF. WHEN YOU HAVE SHELTER AND FOOD AND PROTECTION, THEN COMES THE JOY OF EXPRESSION. AND THAT’S HOW THE FURNITURE WAS, BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY, IT STARTED WITH FURNISHING OUR LIVES. NOW WE’RE ABLE TO ABSTRACT IT, AND WE’RE ABLE TO PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. I DON’T HAVE THE BALLS TO CALL IT ART YET, BUT I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN ART, SO IF IT WAS GOING IN THAT DIRECTION, IT WOULDN’T BE A SURPRISE THAT I WOULD WANT IT TO. BUT FOR NOW, THIS IS MICHÈLE AND ME PLAYING TOGETHER. WE’VE BEEN TOGETHER 27 YEARS, AND IT’S LOVELY TO HAVE A NEW WAY OF PLAYING. PLAY IS IMPORTANT. I WAS AN ONLY CHILD, AND I WAS FEARFUL OF PEOPLE, SO I NEVER DEVELOPED THAT SENSE OF PLAY THAT I THINK THAT MICHÈLE DID, BECAUSE SHE WENT TO BOARDING SCHOOL ALL HER LIFE, SO SHE LEARNED HOW YOU NEGOTIATE THINGS. WWD: DO YOU HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED ROLES, OR DO YOU PING-PONG IDEAS? R.O.: IT’S PRETTY CLEARLY DEFINED. I USUALLY COME UP WITH THE INITIAL SHAPES, AND MICHÈLE EXECUTES THEM. BUT EXECUTION IS A VERY CREATIVE, SPECIFIC THING. THE EXECUTION INFLUENCES THE ORIGINAL INSPIRATION AND IT BECOMES A VERY ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF IT. I THINK THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS HERE. ALSO, MICHÈLE IS INCREDIBLY MERCURIAL AND IMPOSSIBLE TO PIN DOWN AND I’M VERY PEDANTIC. I CAN’T STEER HER, I CAN’T INFLUENCE HER, SHE JUST EXECUTES IT, BUT IT ALWAYS TURNS OUT GREAT. I TRUST HER, AND I TRUST HER MORE THAN I TRUST ANYONE ON THE PLANET. THAT WASN’T EASY, BECAUSE I’M VERY SKEPTICAL AND I’M VERY MISTRUSTFUL. I’M FAIRLY CYNICAL, SO TRUST IS NOT MY COMFORT ZONE. WWD: WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING FOR THE TRIENNALE SHOW? R.O.: IT’S GOING TO BE A MIX, AND I’M NOT GOING TO GET TOO ABSTRACT. I LIKE HISTORY AND I LIKE BEING ABLE TO REWRITE HISTORY, AND THAT’S WHAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS ALLOWS YOU TO DO. YOU’RE ABLE TO QUIETLY SWEEP AWAY ALL YOUR MISTAKES, JUST CELEBRATE ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU CONSIDER SUCCESSFUL AND JUST PAINT YOURSELF IN A WHOLE PRETTY PICTURE. SO I’M VERY HANDS-ON. MY STRENGTH, AND MY PROBLEM, IS THAT I USUALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WANT, WHICH IS THIS AMAZING GIFT, OR A HUGE EGO PROBLEM. IT’S BOTH, I’M SURE, AND I FORGIVE MYSELF IF IT’S AN EGO PROBLEM. I’VE LEARNED HOW TO DO THAT. SO IT’S NOT LIKE I INVITE PEOPLE TO INTERPRET MY WORK. I HATE THAT — HATE IT! BEING ABLE TO DO IT ALL ON MY OWN, I’M ABLE TO SET A STANDARD. THAT’S VERY SATISFYING. I MEAN, TALKING ABOUT LEGACY SOUNDS REALLY POMPOUS, BUT IT IS NICE AFTER EXECUTING A LOT OF YEARS OF WORK TO THINK THAT YOU’LL BE ABLE TO TELL YOUR STORY IN THE WAY THAT YOU WANT IT TO BE TOLD. WWD: IS THAT ALSO WHY IT’S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO HAVE SO MUCH INPUT INTO YOUR STORE DESIGN? R.O.: I PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT AND IT’S A VERY PERSONAL THING. I’M JUST NOT GOOD AT SHARING. I ALWAYS LIKE KNOWING THAT SOMETHING I’M INTERESTED IN WAS NOT A COMMITTEE DECISION, THAT IT WAS ONE PERSON’S FEROCITY AND DRIVE AND DETERMINATION AND INSPIRATION THAT MADE THAT HAPPEN. THAT’S WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR, SO THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO BE. I DON’T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT COMPROMISE. WWD: IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH YOU WOULDN’T BE OPEN TO SELLING YOUR COMPANY. R.O.: I’M BURNING IT DOWN. I’M TAKING IT WITH ME [LAUGHS]. WWD: IS IT HARD TO BE AN INDEPENDENT DESIGNER? R.O.: I DON’T KNOW IF I’VE EVER HAD DIFFICULTIES — I’VE BEEN SO PROTECTED BY MY PARTNERS. I’M SENSIBLE. I’M NOT AN INDULGENT CHILD THAT JUST SELFISHLY WANTS EVERYTHING TO BE CAKE ALL THE TIME. I MEAN, I HAVE A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD MAKING A BUSINESS WORK, BUT I DON’T REALLY EVER FEEL LIKE I HAD TO MAKE COMPROMISES. I DON’T HAVE TO SELL STUFF I DON’T LIKE. EVEN OUR CHEAPEST T-SHIRT, I LOVE AND I’M PROUD OF. I LOVE THE COMMERCIAL SIDE. I LOVE THINKING OF THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE. I LOVE SIMPLE DESIGN. I NEVER REALLY HAD THAT MUCH DISCOMFORT. NOW, I DON’T BELIEVE IN A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT EITHER, SO IT’S NOT LIKE I FELT THAT I WAS ENTITLED TO A LOT. I FEEL LIKE WE’RE KIND OF LUCKY FOR ANYTHING WE GET.

TOO BROKE FOR SOHO, THE COUPLE HOLED UP ON SOUTH STREET, AND, OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, DEVELOPED A COMMUNITY THAT CREATED WORKS THAT CAME TO DEFINE THE CULTURAL AND CRITICAL DIALOGUE OF THE CITY IN THE 80S. ALONG WITH THE LIKES OF RICHARD PRINCE, TROY BRAUNTACH, JACK GOLDSTEIN, BARBARA KRUGER, AND OTHERS, LONGO AND SHERMAN—LOVERS THEN FRIENDS—MADE PIECES OF MEDIA-SENSITIVE, POLITICALLY SHREWD PERFORMANCE, PHOTOGRAPHY, FILM, VIDEO, AND DRAWING THAT SHOT TO THE HEART OF AN INCREASINGLY CONSUMERISTIC, IMAGE-LADEN SOCIETY. LONGO, IN PARTICULAR, BEGAN A DIALOGUE THAT WAS AT ONCE AMBITIOUS (LITERALLY: HIS PIECES WERE MASSIVE IN SIZE) AND INTIMATE, TACKLING SUBJECTS LIKE NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS, GIANT WAVES, AND ANIMALS IN CAGES THROUGH PAINSTAKINGLY PRODUCED CHARCOAL ILLUSTRATIONS. FROM THE ICONIC 1980-81 “MEN IN THE CITIES” SERIES, WHICH PORTRAYED MEN IN SUITS, LANGUIDLY FALLING THROUGH SPACE IN IMAGES ENTRENCHED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ADVERTISEMENT WITH FATALISTIC UNDERTONES, TO LONGO’S FROZEN MONTAGE “COMBINE” WORKS FROM 1982–88 (MASSIVE, POLITICALLY CHARGED, MIXED-MEDIA PAINTING, DRAWING, AND SCULPTURES), TO 1989’S DARK “BLACK FLAGS” PIECES AND 2002’S “FREUD CYCLE” DRAWINGS, THE ARTIST HAS ADDRESSED WHAT IT MEANS TO WORK AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD IN DAUNTINGLY NUANCED TERMS. THIS FALL, LONGO HAS NOT ONE BUT THREE MAJOR EXHIBITIONS—“PROOF: FRANCISCO GOYA, SERGEI EISENSTEIN, ROBERT LONGO,” WHICH HE HELPED CURATE, AT THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM, A SOLO EXHIBITION AT GALERIE THADDAEUS ROPAC IN LONDON, AND A SECOND SOLO EXHIBITION AT FINLAND’S SARA HILDÉN ART MUSEUM. RICK OWENS FIRST MET LONGO AT A DINNER PARTY IN PARIS. THE DESIGNER, UNINHIBITED, HEDONISTIC, AND EVER-COMMITTED TO A HOUSE AND AESTHETIC THAT EXTENDS FAR BEYOND BRAND AND INTO THE REALM OF CULT, INSTANTLY BONDED WITH THE OUTSPOKEN ARTIST AND HIS WIFE BARBARA SUKOWA. THIS SUMMER, THE FASHION DESIGNER PHONED THE ARTIST FROM HIS HOME IN VENICE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO MAINTAIN MORAL INTEGRITY IN THE ARTS, THE ALLURE OF THROWING A PUNCH, AND THE PERILS OF CREATIVE LONGEVITY. RICK OWENS—WE MET IN PARIS. I REMEMBER, I WAS AT A DINNER AND WAS SITTING NEXT TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE BARBARA AT MAXIM’S, ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES IN THE WORLD. ROBERT LONGO—YOU GAVE HER THE MOST SPECTACULAR DRESS FOR WHEN SHE GOT THE AWARD FOR BEST ACTRESS AT THE VENICE BIENNALE. SHE LOOKED LIKE A WARRIOR PRINCESS COMPARED TO EVERYONE ELSE. AND THEN I WENT TO SEE THAT SPECTACULAR FASHION SHOW THAT WAS IN THAT STADIUM. RICK—WHICH ONE WAS THAT? THEY ARE ALL A BLUR. ROBERT—IT WAS A WEIRD VERSION OF AN ALMOST SCHIZOPHRENIC COMBINATION OF LIKE “TRIUMPH OF THE WILL” AND A MONSTER TRUCK RALLY. IT WAS IN THE STADIUM AND THE LIGHTS WERE INCREDIBLE AND THE MUSIC WAS F CKING AMAZING. THIS ONSLAUGHT OF MODELS JUST KEPT COMING. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE SCENE IN “FANTASIA,” WITH THE BROOMS COMING AT YOU, WHEN MICKEY LOST CONTROL. I WAS SO JEALOUS WHEN I SAW IT—IT WAS SUCH A GREAT PERFORMANCE PIECE. RICK—THEY ARE FUN TO DO. IT HAS TO BE THEATRICAL, IT HAS TO BE FAST, AND THERE IS A BIG ELEMENT OF RISK, BECAUSE IT’S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE REALLY REHEARSED THAT MUCH. IT’S REALLY KIND OF LIKE THROWING YOURSELF INTO A MOSH PIT. ROBERT—IT FELT RELENTLESS. IT IS REALLY INTERESTING WITH ART—THERE’S ART YOU SEE, THEN THERE’S THE ART YOU REMEMBER. WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT FASHION SHOW WAS THAT IT HAPPENED SO INTENSELY THAT THE IMAGE WAS BURNED INTO MY MIND. THAT SHOW IS DEFINITELY A PERFORMANCE ART PIECE. ACTUALLY, THE BEST PERFORMANCE ART PIECE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. RICK—WELL, IT’S KIND OF LIKE COMING TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE A CLIMAX OF GLORY, ISN’T IT? THERE’S BEEN CONTROVERSY ABOUT FASHION SHOWS, AND I THINK IT’S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE DEAD. IT’S JUST ANOTHER KIND OF WAY FOR PEOPLE TO COLLECT TOGETHER TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING CLIMACTIC. THAT WILL NEVER DIE. IT WILL BE A FASHION SHOW, A ROCK CONCERT, AN ART SHOW, AN ART PERFORMANCE. YOU JUST CAN’T ELIMINATE THAT. ROBERT—IT TRANSCENDS THE IDEA OF IT BEING ABOUT FASHION. IT IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT CLOTHING. RICK—FASHION IS COMMUNICATION—THAT WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN. WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT YOUR WORK IS THAT IT HAS A MORAL CODE, AND I THINK THAT’S MISSING IN ART A LOT. A LOT OF WHAT I SEE IS SO MUCH ABOUT IRONY OR MAYBE WIT. I LOVE WIT, BUT I THINK THAT YOUR STUFF IS MORE PROFOUND BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT MORALITY. I SENSE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING STUFF OUT THERE. AM I RIGHT? ROBERT—OH, IT’S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I MEAN THE TERMINOLOGY “MORAL CODE”—I WISH I THOUGHT THAT UP. WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME IN THE CREATIVE ACT IS THIS IDEA OF HOW DO I MAKE SURE I MARRY A DEGREE OF HUMANITY AND JUSTICE WITHIN THE WORK? FROM THE VERY BEGINNING—BECAUSE I EMERGED DURING THE TIME OF REAGAN—SO MUCH OF THE WORK HAS TO DO WITH RAGE AND FRUSTRATION AND WANTING TO RIP CHUNKS OF THE CULTURE OUT AND PUT THEM IN YOUR FACE AND SAY, “LOOK AT THIS, MAKE A DECISION, TAKE A POSITION.” I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU CONFRONT VIEWERS, YOU DON’T GIVE THEM THIS BANALITY, YOU GIVE THEM A CHALLENGE. THE WAY PEOPLE RESPOND TO MY WORK IS ALWAYS PRETTY STRONG ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THE MORAL CODE IS DEFINITELY A PART OF IT. YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD COULD BE A BETTER PLACE SOMEHOW. ARTISTS ARE INDICATORS OF TIME, WE’RE REPORTERS OF WHAT WE LIVE IN. I AM BASICALLY TRY-ING TO SHOW WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. AT THE SAME TIME, I AM TRYING VERY HARD TO SLOW DOWN THIS INCREDIBLE ONSLAUGHT OF IMAGES THAT WE DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS THROUGH THIS REALLY ARCHAIC MEDIUM OF DRAWING WITH CHARCOAL. DID YOU EVER SEE THAT MOVIE BY [WERNER] HERZOG? HE MADE THIS MOVIE [“CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS”] ABOUT CAVE DRAWINGS. THESE DRAWINGS WERE SPECTACULAR; THEY ARE 30,000 YEARS OLD. AFTER WATCHING I THOUGHT, “THAT’S MY ANCESTRY.” I MAKE CHARCOAL DRAWINGS, IMAGES OUT OF BURNT DUST. THEY ARE IN-CREDIBLY FRAGILE, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, REALLY AGGRESSIVE. RICK—I HADN’T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT CONNECTION: HOW PRIMAL YOUR WORK IS BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING WITH BURNT STICKS. ROBERT—IT IS SUCH A FRAGILE MEDIUM. IT IS DUST CRUSHED INTO PAPER, IT’S NOT LIKE PAINT, WHICH IS A SURFACE—THIS IS ACTUALLY EMBEDDED INTO THE PAPER. I LIKE THE FACT THAT I MAKE DRAWINGS THAT ARE SO BIG. SOME OF THE DRAWINGS WEIGH ALMOST A TON, WHICH IS IN ITSELF IRONIC TO ME. DRAWING IS ALWAYS A PECULIAR, INTIMATE KIND OF BASTARD OF THE HIGH ARTS. THERE IS PAINTING, SCULPTURE, AND THEN THERE’S DRAWING, WHICH IS ALWAYS USUALLY IN THOSE BADLY LIT, BROWN ROOMS IN THE BASEMENT OF MUSEUMS. I TOOK A MEDIUM AND REALLY EXPLOITED IT, FOR SURE. RICK—I ALWAYS LIKED DRAWINGS BECAUSE OF THAT FRAGILITY, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SPONTANEITY. USUALLY WHEN I AM LOOKING FOR SKETCHES FOR BIGGER WORKS, IT IS A KIND OF MORE PURE IDEA BEFORE IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING BIG AND ARCHITECTURAL. ROBERT—OH, IT IS DEFINITELY THE ROOT OF EVERYTHING. YOU ARE DEALING WITH [THE IDEA] ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL. IT IS SO PRIMAL. I LIKE THAT IT IS VERY LABOR-INTENSIVE. THERE IS SO MUCH RIGHT NOW WHERE YOU CAN JUST PRESS A BUTTON TO GET THINGS DONE. TO ME, THE IDEA OF MAKING A DRAWING REQUIRES A KIND OF COMMITMENT. IN A WEIRD WAY, A COMMITMENT TO A SINGULAR IMAGE IS MORE RADICAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE I CAN THINK OF. THE TECHNIQUE IS PRETTY WACKY. WE HAVE TO WEAR MASKS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF AIR PURIFIERS IN THE STUDIO. I ALWAYS WORRY I AM GOING TO GET BLACK LUNG DISEASE OR SOMETHING. RICK—I THINK I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW IT WAS YOUR RELIGION ONCE—THAT THERE IS THIS SPIRITUAL QUALITY TO REALLY BEING PRESENT TO AN IDEA AND IMMERSING YOURSELF IN IT. ROBERT—ART IS A RELIGION. I LIKE THE IDEA THAT I DON’T KNOW OF ANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE NAME OF ART. IT IS SO MUCH ABOUT BELIEVING IN SOMETHING. I LOVE ART HISTORY, I LOVE OLD ART. THERE IS NOTHING LIKE GOING INTO THE MUSEUM AND SEEING GREAT PAINTINGS BY REMBRANDT OR CARAVAGGIO. I STILL GET A RUSH FROM THAT STUFF. RICK—I WAS READING ABOUT THE UPCOMING SHOW YOU’RE DOING WITH [FRANCISCO] GOYA AND [SERGEI] EISENSTEIN, I HAD NEVER SEEN EISENSTEIN’S WORK, SO I’VE BEEN WATCHING HIS FILMS ON YOUTUBE. I WATCH BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIES ON A BIG SCREEN EVERY DAY WHILE I’M SHOWERING AND DOING STUFF AROUND THE HOUSE. THAT IMAGERY REMINDS ME OF YOU, AND I FELT LIKE I RECOGNIZED A LOT OF MYSELF IN IT TOO. ROBERT—THE COMPOSITIONAL FRAMING OF THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT EISENSTEIN IS THE GUY THAT GAVE US THIS THEORY OF MONTAGE. BEFORE HE CAME ALONG, PEOPLE REALLY DIDN’T QUITE UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA OF A CUT. WHEN THE CURATOR KATE FOWLE CAME TO ME AND SAID THAT SHE WANTED TO DO THIS EXHIBITION WITH GOYA, EISENSTEIN, AND ME, MY INITIAL REACTION WAS, “WHAT DO I DO IN THE SHOW?” IT WAS QUITE HUMBLING TO BE PUT IN CONTEXT WITH THESE TWO GIANTS. SHE BROUGHT ME INTO THIS CONVERSATION WITH CURATING IT AND ONE THING WE CAME UP WITH WAS THAT WE ALL WORKED IN BLACK AND WHITE. WE GOT GOYA’S ETCHINGS AND MADE A VERY SPECIFIC EDIT. EISENSTEIN’S FILMS WERE TOOLS OF OPPRESSION AND PROPAGANDA, SO WE STRIPPED OUT ALL THE SOUND AND ALL THE SUBTEXT, AND THEN I SLOWED THEM DOWN TO ABOUT 1 PERCENT. THE IDEA WAS OF THESE ARTISTS RESPONDING TO THE TIME THEY WERE LIVING IN. NOT NECESSARILY MAKING DOCUMENTARY IDEAS, MORE JUST A VISCERAL RESPONSE TO THINGS. THERE IS A CONTINUITY TO IT ALL. RICK—YOU SAY THAT YOU FEEL HUMBLE, BUT IT SOUNDS COMPLETELY LOGICAL TO ME, THE THREE OF YOU. IT IS SO BEAUTIFULLY BALANCED. ROBERT—I AM DOING A SHOW IN LONDON IN SEPTEMBER. I TOOK THE TITLE FROM MACBETH. WHEN EVERYONE COMPLAINS ABOUT HOW F CKED UP EVERYTHING IS, HE BASICALLY SAYS, “LET EVERYTHING FALL APART, AND THEN LET’S REBUILD IT.” THAT’S THE KIND OF ATTITUDE I’VE HAD LATELY. RICK—THAT’S WHAT I THINK IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE THE GOOD PART ABOUT TRUMP. HE’S GOING TO MAKE ALL OF US REACT. THAT COULD BE THE HEALTHIEST POSSIBLE THING. MAYBE IT’S ALL GOING TO WORK OUT FOR THE BEST [LAUGHING.] ROBERT—I ALWAYS WONDER IF I WAS YOUNGER IF I WOULD JOIN UP WITH THESE ANTI-FASCIST PEOPLE. RICK—I THINK THAT IF I WERE YOUNGER, I THINK HAVING AN EXCUSE TO FIGHT WOULD HAVE FUELED ME. ROBERT—MY MIDDLE SON, WHO’S AN INCREDIBLE ROCK MUSICIAN, DECIDED TO GET REALLY SERIOUSLY INVOLVED IN MIXED MARTIAL ARTS. WE GO TO BOXING MATCHES TOGETHER ALL THE TIME. FIGHTING WAS A REAL BIG PART OF MY LIFE FOR SURE. RICK—MINE TOO. BUT I THINK I WAS LESS SUCCESSFUL AT IT. ACTUALLY I AM SURE I WAS. ROBERT—IT DOESN’T MATTER. THERE’S THREE THINGS WHEN WORDS ARE NEVER ENOUGH: FIGHTING, F CKING, AND MAKING ART. WHEN WORDS JUST DON’T WORK ANYMORE THAT’S WHY WE DO THOSE THINGS. I AM SURE THERE’S PEOPLE THAT SAY A LOT OF WORDS WHEN THEY’RE F CKING BUT... RICK—MICHELLE AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME APART AND SOMETIMES IT’S A LITTLE AWKWARD ACCLIMATING OURSELVES TO LIVING TOGETHER AGAIN. DO YOU HAVE THAT? ROBERT—ABSOLUTELY. BARBARA IS BACK FROM FILMING AND OUT IN FIRE ISLAND, AND I HOPE TO JOIN HER SOON. I’M HERE IN THE STUDIO, WHICH IS PRETTY CRAZY RIGHT NOW. IT’S A LONG-DISTANCE RUN. RICK—EXACTLY! HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN TOGETHER? ROBERT—OVER 24 YEARS. RICK—YEAH, I’VE BEEN WITH MICHELLE FOR 25 YEARS. IT IS DEFINITELY A LONG-RUNNING THING. ROBERT—THE IDEA OF LONG DISTANCE IS VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU DEAL WITH YOUNG ARTISTS. THEY WANT TO KNOW THE KEY TO BECOMING SUCCESSFUL. YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT BE-ING AN ARTIST IS A LONG-DISTANCE RUN, WE ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, WE DON’T HAVE THIS WINDOW WHERE WE HAVE TO BE-COME SUCCESSFUL BEFORE WE’RE 30. THIS DISTORTION IS IN NEW YORK MORE THAN ANYPLACE ELSE. I WAS PART OF THE GENERATION THAT WAS REALLY LUCKY. CINDY SHERMAN AND I LIVED IN NEW YORK TOGETHER AND WHEN WE MOVED THERE, THERE WERE MAYBE FIVE IMPORTANT GALLERIES AND A COUPLE HUNDRED ARTISTS THAT I KNEW, BUT MAKING MONEY WASN’T NECESSARILY ON THE MENU. WE WERE HOPING TO MAKE OUR ART AND SUPPORT OURSELVES. I DROVE A TAXI. SHE WORKED AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE A &amp; S. NOW I WOULDN’T WANT TO BE A YOUNG ARTIST AT ALL...I WOULD BE CRAZY. IT MUST BE SIMILAR FOR YOU AS A DESIGNER. RICK—I WONDER IF YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT THAN OTHER GENERATIONS. I WAS PLANNING ON BEING POOR FOREVER, SO I DON’T KNOW. I NEVER HAD A BUNCH OF AMBITION OR HIGH GOALS. THIS GENERATION WITH ACCESS TO SO MANY SUCCESS STORIES ON THE INTERNET, I THINK PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN DO THAT. ROBERT—I AM INCREDIBLY IMPATIENT IN GENERAL, BUT THAT’S BECAUSE I AM A COMPULSIVE, EXCESSIVE PERSON. I REALIZE IT TAKES TIME TO DO THINGS—IT’S OBVIOUS IN THE WAY I WORK. I HAVE THREE SONS AND WATCHING THEM NAVIGATE THEIR LIVES IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT. THANK GOD I DON’T HAVE ANY MORE KIDS, THEY WOULD BE PRETTY WACKY. NOW I HAVE CATS. RICK—YEAH, I MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE KIDS. I THINK I WOULD’VE BEEN KIND OF AN INTENSE FATHER. I REALLY WOULD’VE HOVERED. WERE YOU OKAY WITH THAT? ROBERT—SOMETIMES KIDS ARE HIGHLY OVERRATED, BUT THAT’S A DIFFERENT STORY. MY FATHER WAS ABUSIVE AND MISSING, SO I TRIED TO BE THE FATHER I WISH I HAD. I DID A LOT OF STUFF WITH MY KIDS AND I GAVE UP ON A LOT OF THINGS IN THE WORLD. I COACHED THEIR BASKETBALL TEAMS AND BASEBALL TEAMS, AND I DON’T REGRET IT AT ALL. I HAD SOME REALLY GREAT JOY WITH THEM. WHAT’S REALLY WEIRD ABOUT KIDS IS WHEN THEY ARE REALLY LITTLE, THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY. IF YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT, THEY SHOULD BECOME ORDINARY WHEN THEY BECOME TEENAGERS. THEY BECOME INCREDIBLY ABSTRACT, AND YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW WHO THE F CK THEY ARE ANYMORE—IT’S LIKE SOME WEIRD SCIENCE FICTION FILM, LIKE WHO IS THIS F CKING MONSTER LIVING IN MY HOUSE? RICK—YEAH I WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD THE PATIENCE WITH KIDS. I GUESS IT’S DIFFERENT WHEN THEY ARE YOUR KIDS. ROBERT—YEAH, BUT I ALSO HAD THE WIFE WITH THE KIDS, WHICH WAS A VERY IMPORTANT THING. I DID MISS A LOT. MY LIFE WAS QUITE ANIMATED IN THE 80S. WHEN THE KIDS CAME ALONG, THINGS CHANGED. RICK—DID YOU OVERDO IT IN THE 80S? ROBERT—I’VE BEEN SOBER FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS IT A LITTLE BIT. I HAD ENOUGH SUCCESS THAT I BASICALLY TRIED TO USE ALL THE MONEY I WAS MAKING TO MAKE MY WORK AND THE WORK GOT BIGGER AND MORE COMPLICATED. I WAS OUT OF CONTROL. I DIDN’T HAVE A ROLE MODEL FOR HOW I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AS AN ARTIST. I WANTED TO BE A ROCKSTAR ARTIST. DRUGS AT ONE POINT SEEMED LIKE A WAY OF FUELING MYSELF, COKE GAVE YOU ALL THIS INCREDIBLE ENERGY TO ACT, BUT THEN YOU START DABBLING IN ALL THIS OTHER S IT LIKE HEROIN, YOU START GETTING REALLY LOST WITH THIS S IT. I WENT TO THIS REHAB IN ARIZONA AND IT SAVED MY LIFE. I SOMETIMES MISS A GLASS OF WINE, BUT THERE WAS A REALLY ROUGH PERIOD OF TIME WHEN I DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO FIND WHAT IT WAS I WAS DOING WHEN I FIRST GOT SOBER. I FIND NOW I CAN GO TO THE SAME PLACES I WENT TO IN MY MIND WHEN I WOULD GET F CKED UP, BUT NOW I AM MUCH MORE JUDICIOUS IN MY THINKING AND MORE CAREFUL IN HOW TO EXECUTE THINGS. I AM STILL PRETTY COMPULSIVE, BUT I AM NOT OUT OF CONTROL. HOW ABOUT YOU? RICK—I THINK I WANT ROBERT LONGO TO HAVE BEEN A MONSTER ROCKSTAR OUT-OF-CONTROL ARTIST IN THE 80S. THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. I HOPE YOU DON’T REGRET IT. ROBERT—NO I DON’T, I CAN’T. IT HAPPENED, IT’S OKAY. WHEN PEOPLE START CRITICIZING THE MONEY IN THE ART WORLD, THEY GO BACK TO ME AND JULIAN SCHNABEL. WE HAD THE ORIGINAL STAIN. MEANWHILE, PEOPLE LIKE [JEFF] KOONS HAVE MADE MONEY THAT MAKES WHAT WE MADE LOOK LIKE CIGARETTE MONEY. WE ARE THE ORIGINAL SINNERS. BUT THAT’S OKAY. I ALWAYS THINK OF THE IDEA OF ARTISTS MAKING MONEY, AND PEOPLE FROWNING UPON IT, LIKE, “WHAT, YOU STILL WANT US TO BE STARVING AND CUT OFF OUR F CKING EARS? WHAT DO YOU WANT?” RICK—I THINK YOU DESERVE ALL OF IT, AND MORE. ROBERT—THANK YOU RICK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RICK—I WENT THROUGH ALL THE EXCESSES AND EVERYTHING AND I LOVE IT. I WISH I COULD STILL DO IT AND STILL HAVE THAT APPETITE AND I COULD BOUNCE BACK FROM IT. I JUST CAN’T HANDLE IT ANYMORE SO I JUST DON’T DO IT. WHEN I DIE I WANT TO HAVE BITTEN OFF EVERYTHING I COULD CHEW. I WANT AS MANY SCARS AS POSSIBLE, I WANT TO ENJOY EVERYTHING. I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN INDULGING APPETITE. ROBERT—I AGREE. YOU WANT TO BURN BRIGHT BUT YOU WANT TO BURN LONG. RICK—YEAH, LUCKILY WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUR TIME IN AND CAN FIGURE OUT HOW FAR WE CAN GO. A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN’T THAT LUCKY. ROBERT—I THINK WE’RE MAKING THE BEST WORK OF OUR LIVES. WE ARE SMART ENOUGH, WE ARE OLD ENOUGH, WE HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE NOW. I LOOK BACK AT MY OWN CAREER AND THERE WERE TIMES I REALLY LOST MYSELF, BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW I AM REALLY ROCKING. MY FOCUS IS REALLY INTENSE. I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WANTING THE NIGHT TO GO REALLY FAST SO I CAN GET UP IN THE MORNING. I AM THAT READY TO F CKING GO. IT’S THAT EXCITING TO ME. I ALWAYS WORRIED WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE AT THIS AGE, DO YOU JUST GIVE UP? OR FORGET? WHAT HAPPENS? WHAT’S THAT LINE FROM ROBERT FROST? “MILES TO GO BEFORE I SLEEP?” I GOT MY RUNNING SHOES ON.

THAT’S “TIME! LORD!” SPOKEN WITH A THUNDERING APOCALYPTIC MOVIE TRAILER VOICE. BECAUSE AS OWENS ADMITS HIMSELF, HE LOVES A BIT OF THEATRE. AND HIS WORK WAR-RANTS THAT GRANDIOSE INTRODUCTION. HIS SHOWS HAVE TAKEN ON THE SEEMINGLY ONEROUS MANTLE OF CONVEYING SOME BIG IDEAS. BIG, AS IN IMPORTANT. SIGNIFICANT. UNIVERSAL, EVEN. SOME-HOW, OWENS MANAGES TO REAFFIRM YOUR BELIEF IN DRAMATIC LARGESSE – IN BOTH THE CLOTHES AND THE IDEAS BEHIND THEM. AND THAT’S WHY WITHOUT HESITATION, WE CAN WHOLEHEARTEDLY BESTOW HIM WITH THE TITLE: MASTER OF OUR TIMES. WHEN OWENS NAMES A COLLECTION ‘GLITTER’, THERE’S NOT A SPARKLY SPECKLE IN SIGHT. INSTEAD HE’S MAKING REFERENCE TO THE 70S GLAM ROCK TRANSGRESSIVE REACTION AGAINST CONSERVATISM, BY BLOWING UP PUFFER VOLUMES ON THE BODY AS A FORM OF PROTECTIVE ARMOUR, AS SEEN IN HIS A/W17 MENSWEAR SHOW. AND FOR HIS WOMEN, THE GLITTER IS ELEVATED AND INCORPORATED AS PART OF A CONTEMPORARY CEREMONIAL RITUAL. THEY LOOKED LIKE HIGH PRIESTESSES THAT ARE WEATHERING CONFLICT WITH REGAL HEADGEAR CONSTRUCT-ED OUT OF SWEATSHIRT SLEEVES AND JERSEY. THE TEXTILE LANGUAGE IS A TRIED AND TESTED STOMP-ING GROUND FOR OWENS BUT TODAY THE SHEARLING, LEATHER AND PADDED OUT NYLON PATCHED ON TO THE BODY TOOK ON A MORE PERTINENT MESSAGE OF WEATHERING THROUGH A CHAOTIC STORM OF A WORLD. IN RECENT YEARS, OWENS’ MOST INTENSE MOMENTS HAVE ROARED AT DIFFERENT VOLUMES WITH SENTIMENT THAT IS ACTUALLY WORTH YOUR ATTENTION, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN BUYING HIS CLOTHES. S/S14 – BLACK COLLEGIATE SORORITY DANCERS STOMPING WITH GRIT FACE, ASKING THE FASHION WORLD TO STEP UP AND CONFRONT ITS AMBIVALENCE TOWARDS RACIAL DIVERSITY AS WELL AS QUESTIONING OUR IDEALS OF BEAUTY. S/S16 – WOMEN PHYSICALLY STRAPPED AND BOUND TO ONE ANOTHER LIKE STARTLING HUMAN SCULPTURES, IN ORDER TO REPRESENT THE BEAUTY OF FEMALE-TO-FE-MALE SUPPORT, AS A SLAP ON THIS INCREASINGLY CONSERVATIVE CLIMATE, THAT IS STILL SNEERING AT THE IDEA OF SISTERHOOD. AND EVEN WHEN HE’S TREADING ON SOFTER GROUND, THERE’S POWER IN THAT LIGHTNESS. HIS S/S17 SHOW INVITATION DEPICTED A WHIRLPOOL, AS OWENS WAS WONDERING WHETHER IT COULD BE A TRANSIENT PORTAL RATHER THAN A FINITE BLACK HOLE. HENCE THE EPHEMERAL MAISON LEMARIÉ OSTRICH FEATHER CAPES AND THE SWATHES OF DRAPED TULLE. WHEN HE CALLED HIS A/W16 COLLECTION ‘MASTODON’, OWENS WAS PASSING COMMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE INEVITABILITY OF EXTINCTION. YET THE AERATED CLOUD-ESQUE GOWNS OF PISTACHIO AND CREAM WEREN’T WAVING A PLACARD AT YOU. IT’S ALMOST AS IF OWENS HAS CRUNCHED UP THE TIMELINE OF MANKIND IN HIS HAND AND IS ABLE TO STAND RIGHT BACK AND SEE THE WORLD AT BOTH ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND UGLY. AND THEN HE GOES AHEAD AND CUTS, DRAPES AND SEWS THOSE OBSERVATIONS INTO HIS DESIGNS, CLOTHES SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WORN CONTINUOUSLY BY HIS MANY THOUSANDS OF DEVOTEES. AND SO WHEN OWENS SPEAKS, YOU LISTEN AND HEED. YOU GIVE HIM AN EXTRA MILE. NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE INDUCTED YOURSELF INTO THE “CULT OF OWENS”, THAT IMPOSING GANG WHO FAITHFULLY DECKS THEMSELVES OUT IN HIS CLOTHES FROM HEAD TO TOE, BUT BECAUSE WHAT HE’S SAYING CONTAINS A WHOLE LOT OF TRUTH. AND UNDER THE WEIGHT OF FASHION’S LAYERS OF SURFACE-DRIVEN PRETENCE, THAT TRUTH INCREASINGLY CUTS THROUGH. AN AR-RANGED HOUR WITH OWENS AT HIS 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS QUICKLY TURNS INTO TWO AS YOU DRINK IN PRACTICALLY EVERY WORD, SAVE FOR HIS CALIFORNIAN INFLECTED DISCOURSE MARKERS (PLENTY OF “LIKE” AND “YOU KNOW”). HIS BENGAL CAT GAIA, MEANWHILE, WEAVES AROUND US IN LANGUID MOTION. PERMANENCE. EVANESCENCE. CREATION. AND SO WE BEGIN: SL: I, ALONG WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE, FEEL THAT THERE NOW SEEMS TO BE THIS SENSE OF URGENCY IN YOU. MORE THAN BEFORE EVEN, YOU’VE BEEN ARTICULATING SOME REALLY BIG, MONUMENTAL IDEAS IN YOUR COLLECTIONS. RO: I FEEL LIKE I’M ADDRESSING THE HUMAN CONDITIONS AND EMOTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS. I’M JUST ARTICULATING IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SOME PEOPLE ARTICULATE IT IN MORE OF AN ESCAPIST WAY, BUT EVEN IN THOSE ESCAPIST WAYS, YOU CAN READ THAT AS A REACTION, SO MINE ARE JUST MAYBE A BIT MORE ANALYTICAL AND AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL. I’M THINKING IF I’M FEEL-ING THESE THINGS, I’M PRETTY SURE THERE’S A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE FEELING THESE THINGS BECAUSE I’M NOT THAT SPECIAL, I HAVE ORDINARY EMOTIONS LIKE ALL OF US DO AND MAYBE I JUST ARTICULATE THEM A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, A LITTLE BIT MORE BLUNTLY. SL: YOU SAY BLUNT BUT IF WE’RE LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL CLOTHES THEMSELVES, I DON’T FEEL THAT I’M BEING CLOBBERED WITH THE IDEA OF SAY, CLIMATE CHANGE OR FEMALE SOLIDARITY... RO: I’M REALLY TRYING NOT TO COME OFF LIKE I KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS AND THAT I HAVE A SET OF RULES THAT ALL SHOULD FOLLOW, THAT IS SOMETHING I DESPERATELY TRY AND AVOID BECAUSE I ALWAYS RESENT IT, BEING TOLD ABOUT RULES, AND ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE SHOULD BEHAVE. ALL I’M DOING IS... I’M KIND OF, POINTING OUT CONCERNS OF MINE, AND PROPOSING THEM IN AS GENTLE A WAY AS POSSIBLE. I APPRECIATE A GENTLE TOUCH IN THE WORLD. SL: IS HIGH RISE SCAFFOLDING A ‘GENTLE TOUCH’ DO YOU THINK? RO: IT IS, IN A WAY, I MEAN IT COULD HAVE HAD FIREWORKS! SL: OR A PENIS HANGING ON DISPLAY? RO: I THOUGHT THE PENIS THING WAS A GENTLE TOUCH TOO. OF COURSE, IT’S PROVOCATIVE. I LIKE BE-ING PROVOCATIVE, PROVOCATIVE IS FUN. THE PENIS THING WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT VULNERABILITY AND MASCULINITY AND A MEN’S SHOW IS ABOUT WHAT IS MASCULINE, AND WHAT CAN BE MORE MASCULINE THAN A PENIS? AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD HOW YOU COULD BE SO PRECIOUS AND PRO-FANE AT THE SAME TIME. SL: WELL IT’S PRECIOUS FOR SURE! RO: YEAH, BUT IT’S ALSO SO THREATENING TO EX-POSE IT IN A MALE DOMINATED SOCIETY, WHEREAS WOMEN HAVE BEEN USED TO HAVING THE MALE GAZE ON THEM FOR SO LONG. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GENTLE DIG IN THE RIBS AT THIS STRAIGHT WHITE MALE MENTALITY. I KNEW THEY WOULD GET NERVOUS, AND I KNEW IT WOULD INFURIATE MEN AND FREAK THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY DON’T LIKE THAT VULNERABILITY, AND THE FACT THAT WE DIDN’T SHOW IT IN A SEXUAL WAY, ALMOST IN AN INDIFFERENT WAY, MADE IT EVEN MORE THREATENING. SL: WITH THOSE GESTURES IN THE SHOWS, YOU DO KIND OF OSCILLATE. YOU GO FROM SOMETHING THAT IS SOFTER AND QUIETER, TO STEP DANCERS, OR EVEN WOMEN WEARING ONE ANOTHER... RO: YEAH, THERE ARE DEGREES OF INTENSITY. SL: BUT THE GESTURE IS ALWAYS QUITE POWERFUL WITH THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES. RO: I TRY AND DO THINGS I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN GOING TO SEE, AND I MEAN I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SOMETHING THAT TALKS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON. SL: OR THINGS THAT WE ALL OBSERVE. RO: ALSO THINGS THAT WE ARE ALL FEELING. I MEAN, WE ALL FEEL THREAT, AND WE ALL FEEL A RUSH OF EMOTION AT THE THOUGHT OF PEOPLE SUPPORT-ING EACH OTHER. WE ALL FEEL VULNERABLE. I DON’T KNOW, MAYBE THERE’S THIS SENSE OF WANTING TO DO SOMETHING ALMOST CONSOLING WHEN I SET OUT TO DO THINGS THAT TALK ABOUT WHAT WE’RE ALL KIND OF FEELING. I THINK IT’S A WAY OF SHARING. I DON’T WANT IT TO BE ABOUT LECTURING OR PREACH-ING, WHICH IS WHY IT’S TRICKY. I DON’T WANT IT TO BE TOO HEAVY HANDED, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A BIT OF BOMBAST IS FUN. THERE’S SOMETHING JOYOUS ABOUT BOMBAST. SL: IN TERMS OF YOUR OWN VULNERABILITY, WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL VULNERABLE? RO: WELL I KNOW THAT BY NOW, I’M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH GROUPS. AND I KNOW I’M NOT SO COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE IN GENERAL. I’M VERY MUCH A LONER. WHY DO I FEEL THREATENED? IS IT BECAUSE I WAS AN ONLY CHILD AND I WAS USED TO PLAY-ING BY MYSELF AND THAT’S JUST MY COMFORT ZONE, OR WAS THERE SOMETHING WHEN I WAS YOUNG BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF A SISSY IN A SMALL TOWN THAT WAS VERY CONSERVATIVE AND VERY HOSTILE. BUT THEN I’M THINKING EVERY KID FEELS HOSTILITY, EVERY KID FEELS VULNERABILITY AND EVERY KID GETS NERVOUS SO I DON’T KNOW REALLY. SL: BUT NOT EVERYONE CHANNELS IT IN LATER LIFE, INTO SOMETHING LIKE YOU DO. RO: THERE’S A BIT OF VENGEANCE IN WHAT I DO TOO BECAUSE I WAS PICKED ON A LOT FOR BEING WEIRD, OR FLAMBOYANT OR EFFEMINATE. SL: ME TOO ACTUALLY. RO: WEIRD, FLAMBOYANT AND EFFEMINATE?! SL: OH, WEIRD, IT WAS MOSTLY BECAUSE I DRESSED WEIRD. RO: SEE THAT’S THE THING, I AM USING THAT AS AN EXCUSE BECAUSE EVERY KID FEELS PICKED ON FOR BEING WEIRD. SL: IT’S A LINEAR EXPLANATION FOR WHAT YOU HAVE BUILT. RO: SOME KIDS HANDLE IT WELL, AND SOME KIDS GO ALL COLUMBINE AND THIS IS MY VERSION OF GOING COLUMBINE, LIKE WHEN I DO SHOW THE PENIS HANGING OUT, IT’S LIKE A F CK YOU TO ALL OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE SYSTEMS AND FALSE MORALITY THAT I FELT WERE REPRESSING ME FOR ALL THAT TIME. SL: IT’S DEFINITELY NOT QUITE AS VIOLENT AS COLUMBINE... AFFECTIONATE. I DON’T WANT IT TO BE HOSTILE. I LIKE A LITTLE PROVOCATION AND I LOVE THAT THERE WERE THESE OLDER CONSERVATIVE GUYS THAT WERE INFURIATED BY THAT, LIKE KARL LAGERFELD ON TV. SL: WHAT DID HE SAY? RO: THAT NIGHT OF THE SHOW, SOMEONE ASKED ‘WHAT DID YOU THINK OF RICK OWENS’ SHOW?’ AND HE WAS GOING ‘I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST DISGUSTING. I HEARD THAT HE HAD TO GO TO BERLIN TO FIND BOYS THAT WOULD SHOW OFF THEIR CHARCUTERIE.’ AND I REMEMBER THINKING THAT’S EXACTLY THE KIND OF GUY THAT I WANT TO MAKE NERVOUS, ESPECIALLY SINCE KARL LAGERFELD IS A MAN WHO HAS TURNED HIS LENS ON THE GLISTENING PUBIC HAIRS OF YOUNG MEN LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS FOR YEARS. HE’S THE ONE THAT’S BEEN MAKING THESE TITILLATING IMAGES OF MEN. OKAY, WELL HERE’S A D CK, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THIS? AND HE FREAKS OUT AND IT’S KIND OF FUNNY. SL: THAT STRIKES ME AS REALLY SURPRISING, AS HE’S ALWAYS TRYING TO THROW OUT HIS OWN VERSION OF PROVOCATION. RO: THAT’S JUST THE THING, THE PENIS IS SACRED TO ANY MAN, EVEN TO A MAN LIKE KARL. EXPOSING THE PENIS EXPOSES SOME WEIRD PRIMAL CHORD IN MEN, AND THEY REACT ABOUT THAT IMAGE OF VULNERABILITY, I THINK. HE SEEMS LIKE THE MOST LIBERAL PERSON IN THE WORLD, SO YES IT’S FUNNY. SL: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT VIRTUE SIGNALLING? RO: VIRTUE SIGNALLING? SL: THE KIND OF CLIMATE WE’RE IN WHERE IF SOMETHING IS REMOTELY POLITICALLY INCORRECT PEOPLE GET QUITE ‘UPPITY’ ABOUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA RO: IT’S A MOB MENTALITY. AM I GOING TO GET CRITICISED FOR CALLING IT A MOB MENTALITY? SENSITIVITY IS HEIGHTENED AND THAT’S DANGEROUS. SL: ARE YOU REMOTELY INTERESTED IN INSTAGRAM RICK? RO: I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY WE HAVE AN INSTAGRAM CHANNEL, NO IT’S NOT A CHANNEL – WHAT IS IT CALLED? SL: INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT, BUT YOU CAN CALL IT A CHANNEL. RO: OH, ALRIGHT, IT SOUNDED AWKWARD… LIKE A GRANDMA. SL: NO, IT’S OKAY, YOU’RE STILL WITH IT. RO: I LOVE BEING ABLE TO EDIT OUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT, I LOVE BEING ABLE TO SHOW WHAT WE DO. I MEAN, I’M ABLE TO CONTROL WHAT IT IS THAT WE STAND FOR ON AN INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. ANYTHING VISUAL LIKE THAT I LOVE. SL: BUT DO YOU LOOK AT, SAY, VIDEOS OF CATS EVER? RO: I DO EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. I DO HAVE VIDEOS OF MY CATS BECAUSE THEY’RE F CKING CUTE. BUT I’VE MAYBE DONE TWO SELFIES OR SOMETHING. MY INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT IS VERY EDITED, CALCULATED AND VERY FORMAL AND I DON’T THINK THAT’S BAD. I THINK THE WORLD NEEDS MORE OF THAT, I THINK THERE’S A LITTLE TOO MUCH SPONTANEITY AND A LITTLE TOO MUCH SLOPPINESS – THAT’S WHY I’VE ALWAYS LOVED EMAILED LETTERS. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY I HAVE TO TALK IN PERSON, BUT I LOVE AN EMAIL. SL: I LOVE YOUR ALL-CAPITAL-LETTERED EMAILS. WHAT’S WITH THE ALL CAPITALS? RO: WELL I ALWAYS THOUGHT, FOR ME, IT’S KIND OF CHEERFUL. I KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE IT’S YELLING, BUT WHEN I SAY CHEERS WITH AN EXCLAMATION MARK, I THINK IT’S KIND OF LIKE ‘CHEERS!’ YOU KNOW, IT’S A LITTLE ARTIFICIAL, IT’S LIKE A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. IT’S NOT REAL LIFE, AND IT’S MORE FORMAL AND STYLISED. SL: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR VOICE, WHEN I READ IT. I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE. RO: SO I THINK THERE’S A SINCERITY THING TO IT WHICH IS LIKE, THIS IS WHO I REALLY AM AND THIS IS HOW I COMMUNICATE. AND EVERYTHING COMES ACROSS – EVEN IF IT’S SHOUTING TO SOME PEOPLE – IT’S KIND OF LIKE A LOUD CHILD OR SOMETHING, AND THERE’S A NAIVETY TO IT THAT’S KIND OF FUNNY. SL: LET’S TALK ABOUT THE CONTRADICTIONS IN YOUR WORK: SOFT, HARD, DARK, LIGHT, DEATH, LIFE… RO: LIFE IS ALL ABOUT CONTRADICTIONS. ONE OF MY MAIN POINTS IS THAT I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE SET OF RULES ARE. I’M DOING MY BEST TO FOLLOW MY OWN SET OF RULES AND INSTINCTS ON WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT, BUT WHO AM I TO TELL YOU WHAT’S RIGHT OR WRONG. I HOPE I’M NOT BREAKING RULES THAT ARE THAT IMPORTANT. I DO GET TO BE A CREATOR AND, UM, CREATE. SL: BUT YOU TREAT IT AS A PRIVILEGE. RO: IT IS COMPLETELY A PRIVILEGE, AND I GET TO MAKE THE CLOTHES THAT I MAKE IN THE WAY THAT I WANT TO MAKE THEM. I’M MAKING CLOTHES THAT NOBODY REALLY NEEDS, I’M NOT CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING NECESSARY TO WORLD. SL: BUT YOU DO STAND FOR SOMETHING. RO: I THINK THAT I’M PROMOTING IDEAS THAT I THINK ARE KIND, THAT I THINK ARE BASED ON KINDNESS AND I THINK THAT’S A VERY VALUABLE THING. I’M ABLE TO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF LOOKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX OF WHAT YOU THINK IS BEAUTIFUL, I’M PROPOSING DIFFERENT IDEAS OF BEAUTY. I FEEL LIKE I’M IN FASHION AND I’M ABLE TO TALK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL PHYSICAL GESTURES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN WOMEN IN HIGH HEELS AND HUGE BALL GOWNS. IT’S THE IDEA OF CARING FOR SOMEBODY, AND THE IDEA OF NURTURING, I’M ABLE TO TALK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL GESTURES, BEAUTIFUL URGES AND BEAUTIFUL IDEAS. I THINK THAT KIND OF ENERGY IS WHAT MAKES CIVILISATION ACTUALLY CIVILISED. I MEAN OTHERWISE – IN ANY CULTURE – FIRST THERE’S SURVIVAL, HOW DO YOU SURVIVE? AND THEN WHEN SURVIVAL IS KIND OF ESTABLISHED, WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT? THERE’S PLAY, AND THERE’S ASPIRATIONAL EXPRESSION, THAT’S WHAT A CIVILISATION DOES WHEN SURVIVAL IS ESTABLISHED AND THAT’S THE MEANING OF LIFE. IT IS! IT’S EXPRESSING BEAUTY, IT’S EXPRESSING PLEASURE, IT’S EXPRESSING JOY AND COMMUNICATING THAT WITH PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH I’M NOT VERY POLITICAL I ADMIT. SL: ARE YOU NOT? BUT YOU’RE AWARE OF IT. YOU HAVE TO BE. RO: I’M AWARE OF IT, BUT MY POLITICS ARE MORE GENERAL. I’M THINKING ABOUT EVERYBODY AT THIS POINT IN THE HISTORY OF TWENTY MILLION YEARS. I’M NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE STATES PRESIDENTIALLY. I’M NOT THINKING OF SPECIFIC POLITICS, BECAUSE I CAN’T. I REALLY CAN’T GET BOGGED DOWN IN THAT. SL: IT’S THAT ABILITY TO SEE THIS LONG TIMELINE SHRINK... AND STEP BACK FROM IT. RO: I’M THINKING OF MYSELF WITH THE PERSPECTIVE OF HISTORY AND IT’S VERY REASSURING TO ME, BECAUSE IT MAKES ME FEEL INSIGNIFICANT IN A NICE WAY, TO KNOW THAT MY WORK WON’T MAT-TER. NOBODY’S GOING TO CARE ABOUT WHAT I SAID 200 YEARS FROM NOW SO IT’S VERY HUMBLING, BUT IT’S ALSO LIBERATING LIKE ‘GOD, DON’T TAKE IT ALL SO SERIOUSLY’. I’M LOOKING AT AFRICAN ART, I’M LOOKING AT CLOTHES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA, I’M LOOKING AT BALENCIAGA, I’M LOOKING AT LAND ART. EVERYTHING THAT I DO IS A CONSOLIDATION AND COMPOSITION OF ALL OF MY PERSONAL REFERENCES THAT EVERYBODY ELSE KNOWS. EVERYBODY HAS ALL OF THOSE PERSONAL REFERENCES BUT I GET TO DO A COMPOSITION IN MY OWN PERSONAL, POETIC WAY AND I’M JUST KIND OF GOOD AT IT, IT’S KIND OF LIKE FLOWER ARRANGING, SOME PEOPLE ARE GOOD AT IT AND SOME PEOPLE AREN’T. SL: YEAH, BUT YOU’RE NOT DOING NORMAL FLOWER ARRANGING – YOU’RE DOING JAPANESE IKEBANA. PRECISE. DELIBERATE. RO: THAT JUST ME, THOUGH. I’VE USED HAIKU AS A REFERENCE TOO. SL: THAT’S VERY SPARSE AND CONCISE. RO: IT’S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THIS STUFF AND JUST REDUCE IT TO A FEW THINGS. IT’S ABOUT FOCUS, IT’S ABOUT MODESTY, BECAUSE IT’S NOT ABOUT POURING A LOT OF STUFF INTO THE MESSAGE. THERE’S DISCIPLINE WHEN YOU DO A COMPOSITION THAT TIGHT. SL: LIKE TRAILING FEATHERS OR MASSES OF TULLE GATHERED AROUND THE HIPS? RO: YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ELEMENT OF JOY! I MEAN I COULD BE VERY DOUR AND SERIOUS AND TRY TO MAKE MY STUFF OVERLY INTELLECTUAL BUT THERE HAS TO BE MOMENTS OF GIDDINESS. WHERE WOULD LIFE BE WITHOUT THE GIDDINESS... I MEAN WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF JOY. SL: IT’S THAT CONTRADICTION AGAIN. RO: WITH THOSE OLD PERFUMES AND ALL THOSE FLOWERS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT ALMOST SUBLIMINAL NOTE OF WEIRDNESS OR ICKINESS TO MAKE THINGS WORK. THAT’S THE WAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PERFUMES ARE MADE, BECAUSE IT GIVES IT DEPTH AND RESONANCE. THIS IS WHY I TALK ABOUT DEATH A LOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT IN THERE SOMEWHERE TO GIVE IT THE GRAVITAS TO ENGAGE WITH. IT CAN’T JUST BE ICING. SL: DO YOU THINK THERE’S A LOT OF “ICING” IN THE WORLD? RO: THE WORLD IS DRIPPING IN ICING NOW, THE WORLD IS SLATHERED IN ICING, AND WE’RE DROWNING IN ICING. SEE, NOW I’M BEING JUDGEMENTAL LIKE I KNOW ALL THE RULES... RESISTING MORTALITY EVERY MOMENT COUNTS FOR OWENS. AFTER HEDONISTICALLY PARTYING IT UP IN LOS ANGELES THROUGH HIS YOUTH WITH HIS WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY – A BONNIE TO HIS CLYDE – OWENS WENT COLD TURKEY. THEY’VE BOTH BEEN SOBER FOR OVER 20 YEARS NOW. BUT OWENS’ ABILITY TO SEE THAT SHARP EDGED PRECIPICE OVER WHICH ONE CAN FALL AT ANY GIVEN TIME INFORMS MUCH OF HIS RAISON D’ÊTRE AS A DESIGNER. AWARENESS OF HIS OWN MORTALITY ONLY SERVES TO INCREASE HIS APPETITE TO CREATE. HIS DEDICATION TO PERFECTION APPLIES TO HIS GYM-PUMPED MUSCULAR PHYSIQUE AND CAREFULLY DYED AND STRAIGHTENED RAVEN MANE [APPROVED PORTRAIT OPPOSITE] BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO HIS COLLECTIONS. THAT’S NOT TO SAY OWENS HAS ANY GRANDIOSE NOTIONS ABOUT HIS WORK. IT’S A VOCATION AND A PRIVILEGE RATHER THAN AN EGOMANIAC’S WHIMSY. YOU MIGHT PUT THAT DOWN TO HIS CATHOLIC SCHOOL UPBRINGING. BUT BY CONSTANTLY ACKNOWLEDGING HIS OWN RELATIVE INSIGNIFICANCE, AND REFUTING THE WEIGHT OF HIS CONTRIBUTION, IT ONLY MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY HIS OUTPUT DEFIES TIME. THE MEANING OF THE WORD ‘TIMELESS’ HAS BEEN DEBASED IN FASHION VERNACULAR BUT IN THE CASE OF OWENS, HIS CLOTHES CAN’T REALLY BE PLACED INTO A DEFINED STYLISTIC GENRE. LONG AFTER WE ARE DOWN IN THE GROUND, ANTHROPOLOGISTS WILL HAPPEN UPON ONE OF OWENS’ CRUMPLED LEATHER JACKETS AND OVER-DYED JERSEY T-SHIRTS (THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF OWENS’ SIZEABLE BUSINESS) AND ANALYSE THE MEANING OF THE WAY FABRIC HAS BEEN TREATED TO LOOK LIKE IT HAS BEEN WORN FOR YEARS. AND SO WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF OWENS BEING LUCID OF HIS MORTALITY, HE ALSO NAVIGATES CONTRASTS THAT MEANS HIS WORK CAN WITHSTAND THAT TEST OF TIME. ANCIENT AND MOD-ERN. SOFT AND HARD. LEATHER AND FEATHERS. SEX AND REPRESSION. LIGHT AND DARK. NOTHING IN BE-TWEEN. THESE EXTREMES ARE ALSO OBSERVED WITH NUANCE AND HUMOUR. WHEN YOU’RE CONFRONTED WITH A LIFE-SIZE WAX FIGURINE OF OWENS PISSING ON THE FLOOR OR WITH GODZILLA MONSTER TAILS, IT’S ABOUT DEFACING THE POMPOSITY OF A SELF-PORTRAIT. OR WHEN OWENS PHOTOGRAPHS HIMSELF DECAPITATED OR PUTTING A GUN TO HIS HEAD, HE’S RECOGNISING THE ALMOST COMICAL ABSURDITY OF DEATH. HERE LIES THE FALLACY BEHIND THAT WHOLE GOTHIC CLICHÉ THAT HAS FOLLOWED HIS CAREER. SL: MORTALITY COMES UP A LOT. DO YOU THINK ABOUT DYING ALL THE TIME? RO: I DON’T BUT, ALL OF US TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, DO ALL OF THE TIME. IN A VERY SUBLIMINAL WAY, WE’RE CONSCIOUS OF OUR MORTALITY AND I THINK AMBITION IS DEFINITELY LINKED TO MORTALITY AS ARE CREATIVE URGES. IF WE FELT THAT WE WERE GOING TO LIVE FOREVER, I DON’T KNOW IF OUR CREATIVE URGES WOULD BE SO URGENT. SL: BUT THE WAY MOST PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIVES IS THAT ONCE THEY FIND A PLACE OF COMFORT, THEY JUST GO WITH THE MOTIONS EVERY DAY. THEY DON’T THINK ABOUT A FINITE END POINT AND I’M NOT SURE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO FIT IN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THAT END POINT. RO: BUT HAVE WE BECOME DESENSITISED? WHEN WE SEE THE NEWS YOU SEE PEOPLE DYING EVERY DAY, YOU SEE, HOW FRAGILE LIFE CAN BE. IF YOU’RE CONSCIOUS OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN, MORTALITY HAS TO BE ON YOUR MIND SOMEWHERE, YOU CAN’T PRE-TEND IT’S NOT THERE. I UNDERSTAND NOT WANTING TO, AND THAT’S FINE. I’M NOT SAYING THAT’S A BAD THING. MAYBE I’M NOT THAT HEALTHY, IF I’M SO CONSCIOUS OF MORTALITY, BUT THAT’S THE WAY I AM. SL: HAS THAT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE? HAVE YOU HAD PEOPLE DIE IN YOUR LIFE? RO: ACTUALLY NO, I HAVEN’T. SL: INTERESTING. RO: YES, IT IS. I’VE BEEN TO ONE FUNERAL WHEN I WAS A KID I THINK, IT WASN’T LIKE A TRAUMA, I WENT TO SEE THE OPEN CASKET AND EVERYTHING, BUT I REMEMBER IT BEING VERY KIND. IT WASN’T SOMEBODY I WAS INTENSELY CLOSE WITH. MY FATHER DID DIE LIKE, TWO YEARS AGO. THAT IS SOME-THING THAT I REFLECT ON A LOT BECAUSE WE HAD A VERY INTENSE RELATIONSHIP AND I WAS THE ONLY SON. THERE WAS THAT WEIRD FATHER-AND-ONLY-SON INTENSITY. I DON’T KNOW HOW I WOULD’VE BEEN AS A FATHER BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS REALLY AN INTELLECTUAL BULLY WITH ME. SL: IS THAT WHAT STOPPED YOU FROM HAVING KIDS? RO: PROBABLY, BUT I’M PROBABLY REALLY SELFISH. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I COULD SEE MYSELF BEING OBSESSIVE – OBSESSIVELY NERVOUS ABOUT THEM, OBSESSIVELY SCARED BUT ALSO A LITTLE BIT LIKE MY FATHER, THINKING OF THEM AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL CONTINUATION AND WANTING TO CONTROL THEM. SL: SO YOU’D DYE THEIR HAIR BLACK AND WANT THEM TO WORK OUT DAILY? RO: I WOULD FORCE THEM TO DO SPORTS. I WOULDN’T BE AS EXCESSIVE AS MY FATHER. WE DIDN’T HAVE A TV IN THE HOUSE UNTIL I WAS SIXTEEN. MY MUM INSISTED ON IT FINALLY. INSTEAD THERE WAS A LOT OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND THEORETICAL LECTURES... THAT’S WHY I DON’T LIKE OVER EXPLAINING, BUT THEN I DO. SL: ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR THAT SENSE OF INSTILLED DISCIPLINE? OR DO YOU RESENT IT? CHILDHOOD WITHOUT ANY FEAR OR SHAME AND BULLYING, I WOULDN’T HAVE THIS MANIC DRIVE I HAVE NOW AND I WOULDN’T HAVE THIS DISCIPLINE, AND THE DISCIPLINE THING IS A PLACE OF COMFORT. I’M NOT TO BE PATTED ON THE BACK BECAUSE OF MY DISCIPLINE BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE I WANT TO BE. PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE THEY WANT TO BE AND DISCIPLINE DOESN’T HAVE TO APPLY TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON, NOT EVERYBODY HAS TO LIKE WORK ON THEIR BODY. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. SL: IS THAT WHY YOU WORK OUT? YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT PROLONGING LIFE? RO: AT FIRST, IT WAS ABOUT VANITY – ACTUALLY IT WASN’T EVEN SO MUCH ABOUT VANITY, IT WAS MORE ABOUT AESTHETICS. I WANT THINGS TO LOOK AS BEAUTIFUL AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN, AS POLISHED AND SLEEK AND SOPHISTICATED AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN, BUT ALSO, IT’S ABOUT A MORALITY THING TOO. I’M THINKING AS I’M HERE, I WANT TO DO MY VERY BEST. IT’S ABOUT DISCIPLINE. SL: YOU WOULDN’T JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON’T DO THE SAME? RO: NOT AT ALL, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHILDREN THAT PUT ALL OF THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT I PUT INTO THE GYM, THEY’RE PUTTING INTO THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT’S A FABULOUS FORM OF DESTINY TOO. THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF DEATH. SL: WE CIRCLE BACK TO DEATH AGAIN… RO: IT’S PART OF THE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS, AND I REALLY THINK THAT EVERYBODY, EVEN THOUGH OSTENSIBLY THEY’RE GOING ABOUT THEIR DAY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT, IT’S THERE IN THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE. AND THERE ARE THESE PRIMAL URGES – PRIMAL URGES TO F CK. LIKE A MAN AND A WOMAN, THEY HAVE THIS URGE TO WANT TO PROCREATE, AND WANT TO LIVE FOREVER, THAT’S IMMORTALITY. WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU’RE TOUCHING IMMORTALITY AND THAT IS A HUGE ROMANCE. I MEAN ALL AROUND US, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE ARE BEING USED IN ADVERTISING TO SEDUCE US, I MEAN THE WHOLE IDEA OF SEDUCTION, IT’S THE OPPOSITE OF DEATH, IT’S WHAT YOU DO INSTEAD OF DIE. SL: LET’S SAY WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THE BIG IDEAS – THERE’S DEATH, AND THEN THERE’S LIFE AND THEN THERE’S CREATING LIFE. DO YOU THINK THAT’S WHAT PEOPLE SEE WHEN THEY WALK INTO YOUR STORES? RO: I THINK WHEN YOU WALK INTO MY STORES IT’S NOT LITERAL AND IT’S NOT IN YOUR FACE, BUT ANYTHING THAT I DO IS GOING TO BE A REFLECTION OF MY PERSONAL THOUGHTS AND INTERESTS. EVERYTHING THAT I DO IS ONE UNIFIED STORY AND IF THESE ARE MY INTERESTS SOMEHOW IT’S IN THERE. I CAN’T GUARANTEE EXACTLY HOW, BUT I THINK IT’S JUST IN THERE. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE CLOTHES, ALL OF THOSE SUPPOSEDLY BIG IDEAS ARE THERE: THE SEARCH FOR IMMORTALITY, WANTING TO BE NOTICED, WANTING TO COMMUNICATE, WANTING TO CONNECT... SL: ARE YOUR CLOTHES IMMORTAL? RO: NO. SL: WON’T THEY LIVE FOREVER? RO: MY CLOTHES WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NICHE, BUT SOMEBODY’S GOT TO REACT AGAINST ME, THE WAY PEOPLE REACTED AGAINST LACROIX. SL: I’M NOT SURE. I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE OF THEIR TIME, AND THAT WILL ALWAYS BE OF THEIR TIME, AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO DEFY THAT AND BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS, AND YOU’RE IN THAT CATEGORY. RO: I WONDER. I GUESS I SEE THAT MY THING BECAME VERY VISIBLE AND IT GOT KNOCKED OFF A LOT. SL: WELL, YOU’VE BECOME AN ADJECTIVE. SOMETHING CAN BE VERY RICK OWENS-Y. RO: YEAH, AND I’M SURE THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF EYE-ROLLING ATTACHED TO THAT, WHICH IS FINE TOO. ANY TIME YOU GET THAT KIND OF VISIBILITY AND YOU GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POPULARITY, THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE A BACKLASH. THAT’S THE WAY FASHION WORKS, THAT’S THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS, AND IT WOULD BE GREEDY OF ME TO WANT TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN KIND OF STATUS FOREVER. I’VE HAD A GREAT RUN. SL: YOU SPOKE IN THE PAST TENSE THERE. IS THAT YOU GETTING YOUR CFDA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD TALKING? RO: IT COULD BE, YOU KNOW IT IS KIND OF A SIGNIFICANT THING, IT MEANS THAT YOU’VE REACHED A CERTAIN LEVEL THAT’S PRETTY HIGH, SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT COMES NEXT. EVERYONE WANTS TO STAY IN THEIR PRIME, BUT THE MINUTE YOU START EVEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR PRIME, YOU’RE AUTOMATICALLY TALKING ABOUT DEATH TOO. SL: NOW HERE I WAS THINKING I COULD WRITE ABOUT REFUTING THAT PRINCE OF DARKNESS THING... DO YOU LIKE THOSE WORDS – GOTHIC, DARKNESS, ETC. RO: NOT REALLY, BUT I GET IT. IT’S A BUSY WORLD, PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE, THEY NEED TO SUMMARISE. I SUMMARISE ALL THE TIME. I TOTALLY JUDGE PEOPLE. EVERYBODY DOES NO MATTER HOW YOU SAY YOU DON’T. SO WHEN I SEE A PICTURE OF MYSELF NEXT TO OTHER DESIGNERS I SAY OKAY THE LONG HAIR, THE BLACK CLOTHES, PRINCE OF DARKNESS OKAY, IT’S EASY. I DON’T BLAME PEOPLE FOR IT BUT I DON’T THINK I WOULD’VE COME UP WITH IT. IT’S BETTER THAN KING OF BLING. I LOVE IT IF PEOPLE THINK I’M SINISTER, AND I LIKE IT WHEN I GET TO TALK TO PEOPLE, AND IT ALWAYS SURPRISES THEM THAT I’M MUCH FRIENDLIER THAN THEY THINK I AM. SL: IS THAT THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT YOU? RO: PROBABLY, BUT I WOULDN’T GO OUT OF MY WAY TO STOP IT. I’VE ALWAYS LOVED MENACE, WE ALL DO. MENACE IS ATTRACTIVE. SL: ARE THERE MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE CLOTHES AS WELL? BECAUSE I ALSO THINK THAT AS MUCH AS YOU DO GESTURE, IDEAS, AND STATEMENTS, THERE’S A LOT OF CRAFT IN WHAT YOU DO. RO: IT’S NOT OVERLOOKED, THOUGH, I WOULDN’T HAVE LASTED THIS LONG IF IT WAS OVERLOOKED. I MEAN, IT’S NOT THE FIRST THING A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT, BUT IT’S THERE, AND THAT’S WHAT PEOPLE ARE BUYING, AND THAT’S WHAT I’M SURVIVING ON. THE REST IS JUST KIND OF ICING; ME, MY PERSONALITY, MY HAIR, WHATEVER, BUT THE CLOTHES ARE – THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE, AND THEY MEAN SOMETHING AND PEOPLE RESPOND TO THAT. SL: DO YOU THINK PEOPLE – LET’S SAY YOUR HARDCORE FAN BASE – ARE THEY BUYING THE IDEA OR THE CRAFT? RO: I THINK THEY’RE BUYING BOTH, THAT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN TO ME SOMETIMES, BECAUSE MY WHOLE IDEA WAS TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE WORLD AND THEN, AT ONE POINT, I FEEL LIKE IT HAD BECOME AN EXCLUSIVE ONE THAT MIGHT BE A TURN-OFF TO PEOPLE. LIKE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT MAYBE GO TO MY SHOW AND THEY SEE THIS CULT THING, AND THAT BUILDS A WALL. IT’S A TURN-OFF. SL: I WAS PRETTY INTIMIDATED BY THAT CULT I HAVE TO SAY. WHEN I FIRST WENT BACKSTAGE TO INTERVIEW YOU I WAS COMPLETELY TERRIFIED. RO: WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUSIVE, BECAME SOMETHING FORBIDDING, AND THAT’S A SHAME. I’M A PRACTICAL PERSON AND WHEN I STARTED I ALWAYS RESENTED THIS HIGH FASHION THING BECAUSE IT JUST WASN’T ACCESSIBLE. THAT THERE WOULD BE THESE DESIGNERS WHO WOULD PRESENT THESE FLOATS AND COME OUT AT THE END IN JEANS AND A T-SHIRT. IT INFURIATED ME, LIKE WHY DON’T YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU’RE PRESENTING. JEANS AND A T-SHIRT IS A MESSAGE, IT SAYS I WANT TO LOOK COMPLETELY AVERAGE... AND I WANT TO LOOK THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. I DON’T WEAR MY COMPLETE RUNWAY THINGS BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT I’M PART OF THAT WORLD, YOU CAN SEE THAT’S MY WORLD… SL: AND YOU’RE GETTING BEHIND IT. RO: AND THE OTHER THING WAS THAT THERE WAS A FLASHINESS TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS; I LOVE THE THEATRE OF OLD HOLLYWOOD, OVER THE TOP GLAMOUR AND ALL OF THAT, BUT I THOUGHT IF I COULD MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE, SOMEHOW, HAVE THIS KIND OF USED FEELING OR MAKE IT FEEL INTEGRATED INTO EVERY-DAY LIFE. IT’S KIND OF FUNNY BECAUSE I STARTED OUT VERY ANTI-RED CARPET… SL: BUT NOW YOU’RE SORT OF MORE BEND-ING TOWARDS THE IDEA? RO: I DON’T KNOW, BECAUSE WHAT I’M DOING NOW IT’S STILL ALL ACCESSIBLE. I MEAN, BREAK IT ALL DOWN, IT’S STILL WHAT I SELL IN MY STORES AND EVERY SINGLE THING THAT IS ON THE RUNWAY IS IN MY STORES. MAYBE THAT’S WHAT HAS CHANGED. I ALWAYS CONCENTRATED ON MAKING BEAUTIFULLY MADE CLOTHES THAT WERE SPECIAL BUT AT SOME POINT, I THOUGHT I HAVE TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER. I AM TRYING TO STICK TO MY ORIGINAL INTENTIONS BUT I FEEL LIKE IN THIS DAY AND AGE, ESPECIALLY WITH ALL OF THE FASHION SHOWS AND THE FASHION THING JUST BLOWING UP, YOU HAVE TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOUR ETHOS IS. AND GOD KNOWS, I DON’T MIND THEATRE! MY LIFE IS, I SUPPOSE, AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT THEATRICAL... AMBITION IS A WEIRD THING INDEPENDENCE IS COVETED IN FASHION. IT’S A PRINCIPLE THAT GUIDES DESIGNERS IN THEIR BEGINNINGS UNTIL MONEY TALKS. IT SHOUTS AT YOU THROUGH IRRESISTIBLE OFFERS FROM CONGLOMERATES THAT PROMISE THE WORLD, UNTIL THE COFFERS DE-MAND PROFIT FROM PRODUCT STREAMS THAT DEVIATES FROM A DESIGNER’S ORIGINAL INTENT. MORE STUFF! MORE SHOPS! WHAT ABOUT A BEAUTY LINE? RICK OWENS HAS LEARNT THE FINE ART OF SAYING NO. HE FIRST SAID NO TO AN OFFER TO BUY OUT HIS LABEL IN 2004. HE CHOSE FINANCE CLOSER TO HOME. IT’S ONE OF THE REASONS HE’S CONSTANTLY NAME-CHECKED AS A DESIGNER’S DESIGNER – RAF LOVES HIM, J.W. LOVES HIM ETC, ETC. HE’S UP THERE IN THAT PANTHEON WITH THE LIKES OF REI KAWAKUBO, WHO INCIDENTALLY INVITED OWENS AND LAMY TO BE HER GUESTS AT THIS YEAR’S COSTUME INSTITUTE MET BALL GALA. WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, OWENS WAS ALSO BACK IN NEW YORK RECEIVING THE GEOFFREY BEENE LIFE-TIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD AT THIS YEAR’S CFDA, AN ACCOLADE THAT HAS MADE OWENS REFLECT ON HIS BODY OF WORK AS A WHOLE, AS OPPOSED TO A SERIES OF SHOWS. AND SO ONCE YOU REACH THAT HIGHLY REGARDED, MEGA RATED ECHELON, ONE QUESTION TO ASK IS WHERE DO YOU GO NEXT? DO YOU EMULATE THE ACTIONS OF THOSE AFOREMENTIONED CONGLOMERATES AND CARRY ON RELENTLESSLY BUILDING THAT CONVENTIONAL EMPIRE – STORE-BY-STORE, PRODUCT-BY-PRODUCT? STABILITY IN FASHION ISN’T CELEBRATED ENOUGH THOUGH. IT’S PERCEIVED AS STAGNATION. THE END GOAL FOR OWENS DOESN’T NECESSARILY REVOLVE AROUND “BIG D CK TERRITORY” AS HE CALLS IT. AFTER ALL, THE LEAN-AND-CLEAN OWENSCORP MODUS OPERANDI IS KEY TO OWENS’ LONGEVITY. INSTEAD AMBITION TAKES ON A DIFFERENT FORM. SELF-IMPROVEMENT AND DISCIPLINE IS INGRAINED INTO OWENS. AND SO THE ENERGY THAT COULD BE EXPENDED ON SUPERFLUOUS PRODUCT LINES OR INDULGENT STORES IS CHANNELLED INTO HIS COLLECTIONS. GETTING BETTER IS OWENS’ ONLY WISH. BUT WHAT IS BETTER BY OWENS’ STANDARD? SL: WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT SO MANY OTHER DESIGNERS NOW RATE YOU SO HIGHLY. FOR THEM YOU ARE THE BEST! RO: I THINK A LOT OF IT IS TO DO WITH THE FACT WE REMAINED INDEPENDENT WHICH HAS BECOME SO UNUSUAL, WHILE ALL OF THESE DESIGNERS ARE BEING ASSASSINATED IN THEIR PRIME IN THESE HOUSES. SL: ASSASSINATED? THAT’S EXTREME! RO: I THINK I’M PROBABLY MORE VISIBLE RIGHT NOW AND BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE I CAN SEE HOW TO CERTAIN DESIGNERS, MY LIFE MIGHT SEEM LIKE SOMETHING MORE IDEAL. I’M ALLOWED TO DEVELOP WHAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN, AND WITH A LOT OF THOSE DESIGNERS THEY CAN’T MAKE ANY DECISIONS WHERE THEY DON’T HAVE TO ANSWER TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND SO IT MUST BE HORRIBLY FRUSTRATING THAT YOUR IDEAS CANNOT GO THROUGH UNFILTERED. SL: HAVE YOU EVER WANTED THAT – BEING WITHIN A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE? RO: OH GOD NO. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A MINUTE WHERE I ALMOST DID IT. AN OPPORTUNITY DID COME UP WHEN I HAD BEEN DOING MY THING FOR TEN YEARS AND I THOUGHT, ‘I MIGHT NEVER HAVE A CHANCE AT THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY EVER AGAIN. WHAT IF I DON’T ACCEPT THIS MONEY AND TWO YEARS LATER, I’M TANKED, DONE.’ IT’S AWFULLY TEMPTING, YOU’RE THINKING, SURVIVAL, SURVIVAL, SURVIVAL… BUT IT WAS NEVER MY DREAM TO HEAD TO DIOR OR WHEREVER. I MEAN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A COMPROMISE. I WOULD RATHER BE RICK OWENS. I DON’T WANT TO BE ON THE LIST OF THE DESIGNERS THAT DID DIOR. I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS HAVING MY OWN LABEL AND I WANT TO BE DIOR. NOW THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE, I SHOULDN’T SAY THAT… BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF DOING THE RIGHT THING. I HAVE CERTAIN STANDARDS, I DO HAVE MORALITY. I REALLY DO. BEING SOMEBODY WHO CREATES STUFF, I’VE ALWAYS THOUGHT HOW CONNECTED IT IS WITH EGO, BECAUSE FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME TO BE SO CONVINCED THAT MY VISION IS SO WORTHWHILE AND THAT I NEED TO INSIST AND PUSH IT OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT AND ABSORB IT – WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN? WHERE DID I GET THIS EGO THAT THINKS I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY OF SUCH VALUE TO OTHERS? SL: DID YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING? BECAUSE PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY DEVELOP THAT EGO AFTER A WHILE ONCE THEY’VE BEEN FETED AND FAWNED OVER? RO: WELL I WAS ALWAYS GOOD AT ART. I DREW WELL AND I WAS ALWAYS THE ART CLASS WHIZ KID, SO I DID HAVE VALIDATION VERY EARLY ON FOR CREATIVITY. I KNEW I COULD DO THAT BETTER THAN A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE. SL: WHAT WAS THE EARLY AMBITION? RO: WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT AS A DESIGNER? I DON’T KNOW, I WANTED TO BE CHARLES JAMES, I’VE SAID THAT A LOT IN INTERVIEWS TOO, BECAUSE I DIDN’T HAVE THE AMBITION... I LIKED BEING ESOTERIC AND NOT COMPLETELY POPULAR. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY ARROGANT THING TO SAY, BUT I LIKED THE IDEA OF BEING ECCENTRIC AND WEIRD AND NOT COVERING THE WHOLE NATION. SL: BUT WAIT, YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE DIOR!. RO: BUT BEING DIOR IS A DIFFERENT THING. DIOR ALWAYS, WAS ABOUT REFINEMENT AND A HOUSE-HOLD NAME – BUT I DIDN’T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THEN OF AIMING THAT HIGH. I ALWAYS THOUGHT I’M GOING TO BE A GLAMOROUS WEIRDO. I DIDN’T THINK I COULD EVER MAKE IT TO THAT KIND OF LEGENDARY-NESS. BUT I CAN MAKE IT TO ECCENTRIC WEIRDO... SL: WELL THEN IN TERMS OF AMBITION, WHERE CAN IT GO NOW? OR WHAT CAN IT BECOME? IS BEING LIKE DIOR THE AMBITION? DO YOU WANT A THOUSAND LICENSING DEALS OR, I DON’T KNOW, A RICK OWENS PERFUME AD RUNNING ON TV OR CINEMA SCREENS? RO: WELL, NO, THAT’S SOMETHING I REGRET A LITTLE BIT. IF I HAD GONE DOWN THAT ROUTE I WAS TALKING ABOUT... THERE ARE LEGENDARY AD CAMPAIGNS LIKE THE HELMUT LANG AD ON THE TAXI CAB. THERE’S SOME THINGS THAT I DO GO, ‘OH I WISH I’D DONE THAT.’ OR ‘I WISH I HAD AN IRVING PENN PORTRAIT DONE!’ I WAS TALKING MYSELF INTO IT BECAUSE I WAS THINKING WELL I’VE DONE IT A CERTAIN WAY FOR TEN YEARS AND I KNOW THAT I LOVE ROUTINE, MAYBE IT’S GOOD THAT I’M BREAKING THE ROUTINE, MAYBE IT’LL INVIGORATE ME AND MAYBE IT’LL BE INTERESTING LEARNING HOW TO PAINT WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF BRUSHES.... ANYWAYS, I DIDN’T DO IT FINALLY, AND THANK GOD. SL: WHAT STOPPED YOU? RO: I GOT A BETTER OFFER. I GOT ALL THE MONEY I WANTED. MY PARTNERS, WHO WERE THE INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, WHO’D COME TO LOS ANGELES, SAID ‘IF YOU LET US DISTRIBUTE YOU, WE CAN HOOK YOU UP WITH A MANUFACTURER AND WE CAN ALL SPLIT IT.’ ANYWAY AT THE TIME I SAID ‘SORRY GUYS. I MIGHT NEVER GET THIS BIG MONEY AGAIN AND I REALLY WANT TO BUY THIS HOUSE’ AND THEY GO ‘OKAY, WHAT IF WE BUY THIS HOUSE FOR YOU?’ AND I GO ‘OKAY, THAT’LL WORK.’ SO THEY COMMITTED TO BUYING THE HOUSE FOR ME. SL: NOW THOUGH YOU’RE OBVIOUSLY NEVER GOING TO SELL YOUR BRAND – NOT FOR A BAZILLION DOLLARS... WELL, MAYBE A BAZILLION DOLLARS? RO: NO, NOT EVEN A BAZILLION DOLLARS, SUSIE. WHAT WOULD I EVEN DO WITH A BAZILLION DOLLARS OR EUROS. THAT’S THE OTHER THING, AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU MAKE THE MONEY THAT YOU NEED RE-ALLY. DO I NEED VACATION HOMES THAT I VISIT ONCE A YEAR? NOT REALLY. DO I NEED A JET? NO. I DON’T REALLY TRAVEL THAT MUCH. IT’S ALL ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE MAKING MONEY AND ARGUING ABOUT MONEY AND TRYING TO MAKE MORE MONEY. SL: IN FASHION I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN THE END GAME REALLY WRONG AND THAT’S WHY YOU HAVE A LOT OF NOT SO GREAT DESIGNERS – BECAUSE PEOPLE’S AMBITION IS LIKE JUST MUCH BIGGER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE. RO: I WANT TO GET BETTER, I HAVE MORE DRIVE NOW THAN I THINK I EVER DID, MAYBE IT’S BECAUSE I CAN SEE WHO I AM. I FEEL LIKE I’M LEARNING, I FEEL LIKE I’M GETTING BETTER, I FEEL LIKE I’M BETTER NOW THAN I WAS TEN YEARS AGO AND I’M THINKING MAYBE IN TEN YEARS I’LL BE EVEN BETTER. I WANT THINGS TO GET MORE REFINED, I WANT MY THINGS TO BE SMARTER, I WANT THEM TO BE MORE RELEVANT, I WANT THEM TO BE AN EXPRESSION THAT I’M REALLY PROUD OF. I WANT THEM TO BE AS SOPHISTICATED, AND AS ELEGANT AND AND AS REFINED – CONCEPTUALLY, PHYSICALLY – AS POSSIBLE. I LOVE BEAUTIFUL, SMART THINGS AND I WANT TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL, SMART THINGS. BUT BE BIGGER? MORE STORES? NO! I CAN’T VISIT THEM ALL ANYWAY. WHAT IS THE POINT? IS THAT LIKE HAVING A BIG D CK? I DO THINK ABOUT GIORGIO ARMANI ACTUALLY BECAUSE ARMANI WAS ALWAYS SOMEONE THAT I PERSONALLY IDENTIFIED WITH. I LOVED THE NEUTRALITY. SL: YOU MEAN EIGHTIES ARMANI? RO: EVEN NOW HE’S CONSISTENT. HERE’S SOMEBODY WHO HAS HIS VISION, THERE’S DEFINITELY INTEGRITY THERE. FROM MY GENERAL PERCEPTION I STILL SEE A SIGNATURE, AN EMPIRE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF NEUTRALITY, ELEGANCE, A 1930S THING, WHICH I’M, OF COURSE, TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH. SL: SO HE HAS LIKE TOWELS, HOTELS AND COSMETICS... DO YOU WANT ALL OF THAT? RO: WELL THAT’S JUST IT, I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I’M THINKING, ‘I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S WHERE I REALLY WANT TO GO’. I LOVE THAT HE DID IT THAT WAY, BUT WHEN IT GETS THAT BIG, IT’S NOT AS EXQUISITE. SL: COULD YOU NOT MAKE AN EXQUISITE TOWEL, RICK? RO: IT BECOMES BIG D CK TERRITORY. SL: YOU COULD DO A GREAT RESTAURANT. VISIT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO ME? BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU CAN’T STAY STILL OR ELSE YOU DIE. IF YOU REACH A PLATEAU AND PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT, IT’S TROUBLE. YOU CAN’T COMFORTABLY STAY IN A PLATEAU – YOU HAVE TO MOVE. BUT THERE’S DIFFERENT WAYS OF MOVING AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT GETTING BIGGER IS THERE’S MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED. I HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW, I DON’T WANT MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO TALK TO. I DON’T WANT TO HAVE MORE MEETINGS. IF I DON’T WANT TO DO MEETINGS, I HAVE TO GIVE CONTROL OVER TO A GROUP OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THINGS UNDER MY NAME. THAT MAKES ME SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE, I DON’T LIKE THAT. SL: DELEGATING. COMPROMISING. RO: THAT’S WHAT A RESTAURANT IN HONG KONG ENTAILS, IT ENTAILS COMPROMISE. SL: JUST OUT OF INTEREST, WHAT WOULD YOU SERVE? RO: OH, IT’D BE ALL BIO, LIKE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ORGANIC THINGS LIKE MADE FROM A GARDEN THAT WE GROW. SL: ON BLACK PLATES? RO: PROBABLY NOT, PROBABLY WHITE. I LIKE WHITE TABLE CLOTHS AND WHITE PLATES. THERE’S A REAL CLASSIC STREAK TO ME. SL: OK SO NO OTHER REALMS THEN? RO: WELL, NEVER SAY NEVER... I MEAN IN FIVE YEARS TIME I MIGHT BE COMPLETELY VORACIOUS AND WANT STORES EVERYWHERE AND, YOU KNOW, HOOKERS AND COKE. I DON’T KNOW! I HAD THIS CHILDHOOD THAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY OPPRESSIVE, ALTHOUGH I ALWAYS THINK THAT EVERY KID FEELS THAT WAY, SO WHAT MAKES ME SO SPECIAL. BUT THEN WHEN I GOT OLDER, I WAS ABLE TO BE AS FREE AS I WANTED AND I WAS AS EXCESSIVE AS I COULD POSSIBLY BE. I WAS AS FLAMBOYANT, ECCENTRIC AND HIGH AS I COULD BE ALL THE TIME UNTIL THAT WORE ITSELF OUT. PARTLY PHYSICALLY BECAUSE MY BODY JUST COULDN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE, BECAUSE I WOULD STILL DRINK IF I DIDN’T GET HANGOVERS. I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING A LUST FOR LIFE. I LOVE MY FRIENDS THAT CAN ELEGANTLY HANDLE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL EVERY NIGHT. THEY’RE PARTICIPATING AND SATISFYING LUSTY APPETITES, THEY’RE SEIZING THE WORLD BY THE HORNS AND ENJOYING IT IN AN ELEGANT WAY WITHOUT SEEMING TO SUFFER ANY SIDE EFFECTS. SL: THEY’RE JUST WANTING TO ESCAPE? RO: BUT IT’S NOT TO ESCAPE. IF THERE ARE ALL THESE PLEASURES OUT THERE, AREN’T THESE PLEASURES MEANT TO BE ENJOYED? THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT JUST USE THEM FOR ENJOYMENT’S SAKE, NOT TO ESCAPE. I DID IT TO ESCAPE AND THAT’S BECAUSE OF ME, AND THAT’S MY FAULT AND THAT’S MY WEAKNESS. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ENJOY PLEASURE. AND I THINK THAT’S A FANTASTIC THING. I WISH I WAS LIKE THAT, I WISH I COULD DO THAT MORE. SL: SO WHAT GIVES YOU PLEASURE? RO: CREATING BEAUTIFUL THINGS, DISCIPLINE, FEELING ORGANISED, FEELING CLEARHEADED, STABLE. SL: LIKE A CREATIVE MONK! RO: I LIKE EATING CAKE. I LIKE STUPID MOVIES SOMETIMES, AND I LIKE GOING DANCING. MY PAST OF EXCESS BECAME DISCIPLINE. MY CLOTHES ARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THAT CONTROL AND COLLAPSING – LIKE THAT PART OF YOU THAT EVERYBODY HAS. LIKE WHAT IF I JUST LET GO AND COMPLETELY INDULGED MYSELF IN EVERYTHING AND THOUGHT OF ONLY PLEASURE. WHAT IF I WAS JUST COMPLETELY SELFISH AND JUST FORGOT ABOUT ALL RESPONSIBILITIES AND DISCIPLINE, AND ORDER. EVERYBODY LIKES TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE WICKED JUST FOR A SECOND AND THAT’S THE ID SPEAKING TO US. THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I’M VERY CONTROLLED WITH MY CLOTHES AND THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I’VE LUGUBRIOUSLY COLLAPSED. SL: WICKED MOMENTS... RO: THERE WAS A BRUTALISM PHASE, AND THEN THERE WAS AN ART NOUVEAU PHASE AND ART NOUVEAU IS VERY MUCH ABOUT GIVING INTO SENSUALITY. CURVES, ORGANIC AND DRIPPING AND I INDULGED IN THAT FOR A WHILE WITH MY CLOTHES AND IT WAS KIND OF A COMMENTARY ON DISCIPLINE AND CHAOS AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WHEN YOU INDULGE IN THAT MUCH ‘DRIPPINESS’ IT’S A REACTION AGAINST CONTROL. THAT’S KIND OF THE STORY OF MY LIFE – TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE BETWEEN THEM. SL: AN EQUILIBRIUM? RO: YES, EXACTLY, AN EQUILIBRIUM. A BALANCE THAT EMBRACES KINDNESS, LOVE AND BEING. CONTRIBUTING IN A POSITIVE WAY TO THE WORLD. AND FULFILLING YOUR POTENTIAL IS KIND OF A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TOO. SL: MORAL – REALLY? RO: YEAH, I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN I DO THE SHOWS, I FEEL MORALLY I NEED TO TALK ABOUT BEAUTY THAT ISN’T CLICHÉ, THAT ISN’T STANDARDS OF BEAUTY THAT ALREADY GET TALKED ABOUT A LOT EVERYWHERE ELSE. SL: WHO OUT THERE DO YOU LIKE? RO: CLOTHES WISE? I DON’T KNOW... I DON’T LIKE ANYBODY JUST BECAUSE I’VE BECOME SO ANALYTICAL. ALTHOUGH I DID SEND A TEXT TO RAF THE OTHER DAY AND I SAID ‘I JUST WENT TO THE CALVIN KLEIN STORE AND I CAN’T WAIT TO GO BACK WHEN IT IS AN APEX OF JOHN PAWSON, RAF SIMONS, CALVIN KLEIN AND STERLING RUBY AND WHEN ALL OF THOSE FORCES COLLIDE IN THAT SPACE I’M GOING TO FALL DROOLING ON THE FLOOR.’ AND I WASN’T KIDDING. I RESPECT JOHN PAWSON A LOT, I RESPECT WHAT CALVIN DID, I RESPECT RAF, I RESPECT STERLING RUBY, WHO IS SUPPOSED TO REDESIGN THAT STORE I BELIEVE, SO I’M THINKING WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I’M REALLY GOING TO LIKE BEING IN THERE. IT’S KIND OF GOING TO BE LIKE THE TATE. IT’S GOING TO BE A MOMENT OF CONTEMPORARY AESTHETICS CONVERGING IN A PLACE THAT I LIKE AND THAT’S WHY GOING TO THE MET, OR GOING TO THE CFDA, THESE THINGS FOR ME WERE GREAT BECAUSE THEY WERE MOMENTS WHERE ALTER-NATIVE AESTHETICS WERE NOW BEING RECOGNISED. SL: DID IT FEEL LIKE THAT WHEN YOU WERE THERE THOUGH? RO: NO, NO, NO! GOD, IT WAS F CKING CRAZY. [RICK GOES OFF THE RECORD TO DESCRIBE REI KAWAKUBO AT THE MET WATCHING KATY PERRY SINGING ‘REI MAKES ME FEEL SO SEXY...’] SL: AND WAS IT ODD TO RECEIVE THE CFDA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD, EVEN IF WHAT YOU DO IS SOMETIMES A “F CK YOU” TO THE FASHION ESTABLISHMENT. RO: BUT IT’S NOT. IT’S A TWEAKING AND IT’S TEASING AND IT’S A GENTLE REMINDER; IT’S NEVER REALLY A HOSTILE F CK YOU. LIKE I SEE OTHER THINGS THAT I THINK ARE ACTUALLY F CK YOU’S. MY THING IS MORE LIKE ‘HEY! OVER HERE! WE’VE GOT LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT AESTHETIC THING IF YOU’RE INTERESTED!’ THAT’S HOW I WANT IT TO BE. I DON’T WANT IT TO BE A F CK YOU. AND I DON’T THINK IT IS. I THINK WHEN I DO THINGS THEY ARE AFFECTIONATE. SL: BUT THEN WHEN YOU RECEIVED THAT CFDA AWARD, WAS THERE EVER A FEELING LIKE, ‘OH WELL TEN YEARS AGO NONE OF YOU WANTED TO KNOW, BUT NOW YOU DO.’ RO: NO, I CAN SEE HOW IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THAT BUT I HAVEN’T MADE AN EFFORT TO BE A PART OF THAT GROUP AND I’M NOT PART OF THE US FASHION INDUSTRY AND IT’S NOT LIKE I WAS SUPER FRIENDLY OR ANYTHING. I’M NOT THAT GREGARIOUS, SO I GET IT. EVERYBODY HAS A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO DO, AND IT’S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO NOTICE ME. SL: WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU WERE TOLD YOU WERE GETTING THE AWARD? RO: IT WAS VERY VALIDATING. I’LL BE HONEST THOUGH, I THOUGHT SOMEONE LIKE THE CFDA WILL PROBABLY RECOGNISE ME LIKE, TEN YEARS FROM NOW IF I LAST, BECAUSE IF I CAN LAST FOR A LONG TIME AT A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO GET AROUND TO ME SOONER OR LATER. BUT COMING AT THIS MOMENT, I WAS LIKE ‘WOW THEY REALLY NOTICED.’ I MEAN SOMEBODY REALLY NOTICED THAT I WAS DOING STUFF AND THAT’S KIND OF AMAZING. BECAUSE I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT I’M FAIRLY INVISIBLE SINCE WE’RE A SMALL COMPANY, AND IT’S NOT LIKE I HAVE HUGE INSTAGRAM LIKES OR ANYTHING. SL: DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL MORE LIKE AN AMERICAN DESIGNER? RO: THERE AREN’T MANY AMERICANS THAT HAVE BEEN TOLERATED IN PARIS FASHION IN THIS WAY, SO IT DOES FEEL LIKE AN ACHIEVEMENT. I MEAN, I KIND OF MUSCLED MY WAY IN HERE AND PEOPLE DECIDED IT WAS OKAY. THAT’S KIND OF GREAT. SL: DO YOU THINK YOU’LL BE AN AMERICAN IN PARIS FOREVER? RO: PROBABLY, BECAUSE I’M JUST VERY AMERICAN, I MEAN JUST THE WAY I TALK. HOW COULD I BE MORE BLATANTLY AMERICAN? I’VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MY AESTHETIC WAS VERY MUCH AN AMERICAN REDUCTIVE, BLUNT INTERPRETATION OR SIMPLISTIC INTERPRETATION OR ADMIRATION OR FASCINATION WITH EUROPEAN COMPLEXITY SO I ALWAYS FELT LIKE I WAS DOING A CARTOON INTERPRETATION OF EUROPEAN ALLURE. A BRUTALIST VERSION. SL: I KNOW YOU SAID YOU’RE NOT POLITICAL BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT WHAT’S GOING ON IN AMERICA? RO: I’M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WHOLE DIVISIVE THING IN THE STATES. AFTER EVERYTHING THAT THE WORLD HAS BEEN THROUGH AND AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY, FOR US TO BE REVERTING BACK TO THAT KIND OF DIVISIVENESS, IT’S DISTURBING – ISN’T IT A SHAME? BUT THEN I’M THINKING LIFE IS NOT FAIR – PEOPLE NEVER SEEM TO LEARN. THERE ARE SOME BASIC PETTY ATTITUDES THAT ARE NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY. YOU’D HAVE TO BE A UTOPIAN IDEALIST TO THINK OTHERWISE. YOU’D THINK AFTER EVERYTHING WE’VE GONE THROUGH IN OUR HISTORY WE WOULD HAVE MADE ENOUGH PROGRESS TO LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES BUT THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN. SL: WHY WAS IT THAT LAST YEAR FELT RATHER LIKE 1930S GERMANY? RO: I THINK PEOPLE ARE WIRED TO HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF SELFISHNESS AND THERE’S A PERCENTAGE OF THE WORLD WHOSE URGES MIGHT NOT BE AS PURE. WHEN I SEE CONFLICTS OR SITUATIONS THAT ARE UNATTRACTIVE IN THE WORLD, THERE’S THAT FATALIST INSIDE OF ME WHO SAYS THAT’S THE WAY THE WORLD IS SUPPOSED TO BE. IT’S ALMOST LIKE WATCHING THE MAN NEXT DOOR BEAT HIS WIFE. SL: YOU THINK YOU CAN’T STOP IT? RO: YOU CAN STOP IT, YOU CAN STOP IT IF IT’S NEXT DOOR, YOU CAN’T STOP IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND YOU CAN’T STOP IT WHERE IT’S HAPPENING IN SO MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN PROTECT, YOU CAN HELP AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. AND I’M NOT SAYING LET’S JUST GIVE UP EITHER, I’M UNFORMULATED – I HAVEN’T COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. SL: BUT YOUR WORK IS A FORM OF PROTEST? RO: PROTEST AND HOPE – THINGS THAT I HOPE FOR THE WORLD AND THINGS THAT I HOPE FOR ALL OF US. SL: IF I JUST ASKED SOMEONE RANDOMLY ON THE STREET IF CLOTHES CAN TRULY BE A FORM OF PROTEST, THEY’D LIKELY LAUGH. RO: WELL NO, I THINK CLOTHES CAN BE A FORM OF PROTEST. I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE 70S WHEN CLOTHES WERE GARISH, FLAMBOYANT, AND ALMOST GROTESQUE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF A GREAT REACTION, BECAUSE IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT PROTEST AND SEXUALITY AND SEXUAL BOMBAST. BUT THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING KIND OF HUMOROUS ABOUT IT. YOU HAD TO HAVE A SENSE OF CAMP TO ENJOY EVERYTHING. I THINK THERE’S A NEW GENERATION OF DESIGNERS GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AND I LOVE IT. I LOVE A F CK YOU, AND I LOVE GROTESQUE, I’M JUST NOT COMPLETELY SOLD BECAUSE, ALL I SEE IS NEGATION, AND I DON’T NECESSARILY SEE WHAT THEY’RE STANDING FOR. SL: THAT DOESN’T SEEM TO MATTER TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THESE DAYS. RO: MAYBE THAT’S EVOLUTION, MAYBE WE HAVE GONE THROUGH SINCERITY AND EARNESTNESS AS FAR AS IT CAN GO AND NOW WE HAVE TO GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. NOW IT HAS TO BE ARCH, AND CALCULATED AND CYNICAL. THAT’S INTERESTING TOO. SL: BUT YOU COULD NEVER DO THAT. RO: NO, IT’S JUST NOT THE WAY I’M BUILT, BUT I APPRECIATE SEEING THE YOUNG REACT. THINK ABOUT LACROIX, HOW THE LACROIX PEOPLE FELT ABOUT MARGIELA’S WRINKLED COTTONS. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN AFFRONTED. THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT ‘I DON’T UNDERSTAND THIS, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?’ AND THEN WHAT IS THE STEP AFTER THAT? THERE IS A GENERATION THAT NEEDS TO REACT TO EARNEST INTEGRITY AND AUTHENTICITY BY GOING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION, WHICH IS BRIGHT POLYESTER AND UGLY THRIFT STORE JACKETS, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO REACT AGAINST MY EARNEST THING, AGAINST ME TALKING HERE ABOUT HOPE AND THE HUMAN CONDITION...

I DON’T THINK CAROLINA HERRERA HAS THOSE ON HER RÉSUMÉ.” IT’S JUNE, A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE CFDA AWARDS, AND RICK OWENS AND I ARE SITTING IN HIS GARDEN IN PARIS, BEHIND THE CONCRETE PALACE THAT HAS BEEN HOME TO HIM, HIS WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY, AND THEIR BUSINESS SINCE 2003. HE IS ABOUT TO BE PRESENTED WITH A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD BY THE AMERICAN FASHION INSTITUTION, AND HE IS COMPLETELY DELIGHTED BY THE PROSPECT, UNLIKELY AS THAT MIGHT SEEM OF THE OFT-TITLED DARK PRINCE OF FASHION. “THE THING ABOUT THE CFDA IS THAT IT’S A PANTHEON OF CREATORS, AT THIS POINT IN TIME, AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY, AND I’VE BEEN INVITED TO BE A PART OF THAT. IN A HISTORICAL SENSE, THAT’S VERY MOVING. I REALLY AM HONOURED.” THAT’S THE THING ABOUT RICK OWENS – FASHION VIDEOS OF HORSE AND FIST-F CKING ASIDE, HE IS INCREDIBLY GENTLE. HE SPEAKS SOFTLY AND ELOQUENTLY; HIS FASHION SHOWS, EVEN WHEN THEY MIGHT APPEAR CONTROVERSIAL BY EXPOSING PENISES OR HARNESSING WOMEN TO ONE ANOTHER, ARE GRACEFUL STATEMENTS OF INTENT; HIS CLOTHES, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE OFTEN BEEN LABELED AS ‘GOTH’, ARE SO THOUGHTFULLY COMPOSED AND CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED THAT SUCH A MARGINAL TERM IS MOST CERTAINLY A MISNOMER. WHAT OWENS HAS CREATED OVER THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER IS A UNIVERSE THAT IS AS INTIMATE AS THOSE VIDEOS ARE PROVOCATIVE, AND ANYWAY, “AFTER DADAISM AND CUBISM AND ALL OF THE AESTHETIC GESTURES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST, HOW CAN ANYBODY BE SURPRISED BY ANYTHING LIKE THAT?” NOW, YET ANOTHER ESTEEMED INSTITUTION, THE MILAN TRIENNALE, IS PAYING TRIBUTE TO HIS CAREER BY INVITING HIM TO EXHIBIT A RETROSPECTIVE OF HIS OEUVRE THIS DECEMBER; A TOUR THROUGH A WORLD OF HIS OWN MAKING, ONE THAT IS STAUNCHLY INDEPENDENT AND WHICH CELEBRATES INDIVIDUALITY ABOVE ALL ELSE. IN HIS OWN WORDS, “THERE’S ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT I HAVE WANTED TO SAY, BUT A LOT HAD TO DO WITH BEING AN OUTSIDER, ASKING WHY AM I RESTRICTED TO THESE NARROW PARAMETERS OF WHAT IS AESTHETICALLY ACCEPTABLE? WHO HAS DECIDED THE RULES AND WHY CAN’T I EXPERIMENT WITH THEM?” AS A MAN, OWENS IS A FREUDIAN FANTASY: HE WAS AN ONLY CHILD AND ATTENDED CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN A PAINFULLY NORMAL AMERICAN TOWN; HIS CHILDHOOD WAS “PRETTY MISERABLE”, HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS CONSERVATIVE FATHER SO FRAUGHT THAT HE REGULARLY REFERS TO HIM AS A NAZI. WHILE GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA, OWENS’ HANDWRITING WAS SO FAINT THAT IT WAS ILLEGIBLE TO HIS TEACHERS; NOW, EVERY COMMUNICATION THAT COMES FROM OWENSCORP IS WRITTEN IN CAPITAL LETTERS. IN MANY WAYS – PERHAPS TOO MANY, HE MUSES – HIS WORK, TOO, IS VISIBLY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FIRST TIME HE BECAME INTERESTED IN CLOTHING WAS THROUGH THE RITUALISTIC GARB OF THE NUNS AT HIS SCHOOL AND THEIR DESCRIPTION OF BIBLICAL FIGURES. “IN PORTERVILLE, EVERYTHING WAS SO ORDINARY, SO NORMAL, BUT HERE WERE THESE PEOPLE DRESSED IN VEILS AND ROBES EVERY DAY. FOR SOMEBODY DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR EXOTICISM, THAT WAS IT.” HE SIGHS. “I’M SO OBVIOUS.” WHILE SUCH INSPIRATION MIGHT BE OBVIOUS TO OWENS, ITS MANIFESTATION IS ANYTHING BUT. ON THE RUNWAY THIS SEASON, THOSE FORMATIVE INFLUENCES PLAY OUT IN PIECES THAT HAVE EVOLVED FROM THESE THEOLOGICAL ROOTS, BUT ARE REFRACTED THROUGH A PRISM OF WEIRDNESS: MAKESHIFT BUT MAGISTERIAL VEILS CONSTRUCTED OUT OF WIRE AND SWEATSHIRTS; TABARDS AND VESTIGIAL ROBES PEELED AWAY FROM THE BODY IN FOLDING SWATHES OF FABRIC OR FUR. IT’S A TRIBUTE TO “THE GLITTER OF CIVILISATION”, HE SAID BACKSTAGE, BECAUSE “I’VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF RUNWAY SHOWS AS CONTEMPORARY CEREMONIES. CEREMONIES ARE ABOUT GROUPS AGREEING ON CODES OF BEHAVIOUR AND COLLECTIVELY COMMITTING TO THEM… COMMUNITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND KINDNESS USUALLY TOP THE LIST.” WHILE THESE VALUES ARE THE SAME THAT HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONED THROUGHOUT OWENS’ CAREER, THE AESTHETIC OF HIS SEASONAL COLLECTIONS HAS MOST CERTAINLY EVOLVED: WHERE ONCE THERE WAS ASCETIC SEVERITY, NOW THERE ARE BALLOONING DUVETS AND MUTED PASTELS AND SWADDLING. IT MIRRORS HIS OWN PERSONAL SHIFT: “I HAVE BEEN VERY SELF-DESTRUCTIVE AND SELF-CRITICAL,” HE SAYS, “AND I LEARNT HOW TO ACCEPT A LOT OF MY FAULTS AND FLAWS AND NOT MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT. JUST TO GET OVER MYSELF.” THAT’S NOT TO SAY THAT THE CORE OF THE BRAND’S COMMERCIAL OFFERING – THE EXCEPTIONAL CASHMERE KNITWEAR, THE MOST REFINED LEATHER JACKETS, THE OVERSIZED T-SHIRTS THAT DRAPE LOOSELY AND HAVE BECOME A MUSIC INDUSTRY STAPLE – HAVE DISAPPEARED. THESE ARE, AFTER ALL, THE PIECES UPON WHICH THIS MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS IS FOUNDED, AND WHICH HAVE FOUND FANS ALL THE WAY FROM THE COUNTER-CULTURAL DEVOTEES OF THE BRAND TO MAINSTREAM HIP-HOP STARS. “I LOVE THAT I HAVE ALL THESE STRAIGHT GUYS BUYING MY CLOTHES WHO WOULD HAVE KICKED MY ASS IN HIGH SCHOOL,” HE GRINS – AND PERHAPS THAT’S WHAT’S JUST SO EXCEPTIONAL ABOUT OWENS: THE CODES OF BEHAVIOUR THAT DEFINE HIS WORLD, EVEN MORE SO THAN THE DRAPERY OR THE LEATHER JACKETS, HAVE REMAINED THE SAME. IT’S THE WORLD THAT HAS SHIFTED. SUCH A REALITY WAS HARDLY IMAGINABLE WHEN OWENS FIRST SET UP SHOP IN LOS ANGELES IN 1994. HE DROPPED OUT OF ART SCHOOL BECAUSE “I DIDN’T THINK I WAS CEREBRAL ENOUGH” AND ENDED UP WORKING AS A KNOCK-OFF PATTERN CUTTER AND HANGING AROUND PARTYING ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD BEFORE MEETING LAMY AND REALLY GETTING STARTED IN HIS LATE THIRTIES. “MY BUSINESS PLAN WAS THAT I WAS GOING TO JUST KEEP ON MAKING STUFF AND SELLING IT ON MY OWN AND STRUGGLING UNTIL SOMEONE CAME ALONG WHO WOULD NOTICE IT AND THEN SOMEHOW HELP – WHICH IS A NAÏVE APPROACH, BUT IT KIND OF WORKED,” HE SAID – AND IT DID, TO SAY THE LEAST. BUT SUCH A ROUNDABOUT APPROACH MEANS THAT HIS ARCHIVE IS RATHER SCANT, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING HE’S ABOUT TO EMBARK ON AN EXHIBITION THAT OUGHT TO PLUNDER IT. “IT WAS JUST ABOUT SURVIVAL; IT WASN’T REALLY EVER ABOUT LEGACY,” HE EXPLAINS, “BECAUSE I DON’T THINK I EVER EVEN HAD THE SELF-ESTEEM TO THINK WE WOULD LAST LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE ONE.” SO, IN LIEU OF THE ORIGINAL PIECES, “WE ARE FILLING IN A LOT OF THINGS,” HE SAYS. “WE DON’T HAVE THAT MUCH STUFF. IF PEOPLE GO TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND WANNA SEE THE ORIGINAL STUFF, I GUESS IT’S KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT. WELL I’M SORRY, IT’S JUST NOT THERE.” IN SPITE OF THIS, ASSEMBLING THE ARCHIVES HAS BEEN FAR FROM A CHORE, HE SAYS. “DOING IT IS JUST THE MOST DELICIOUS THING; IT’S KIND OF VALIDATING TO LOOK OVER YOUR SUCCESSES, AND YOU CAN JUST QUIETLY ERASE EVERY MISTAKE YOU’VE EVER MADE. IT’S MY VERSION OF MY STORY, AND IT’S MOTIVATING; IT MAKES ME EVEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC FOR THE FUTURE.” HE PLANS TO CREATE A POP-UP CATALOGUE SIMILAR TO DUCHAMP’S BOÎTE-EN-VALISE WHICH, IF REFERENCED BY ANY OTHER DESIGNER, MIGHT SOUND ALIENATINGLY AVANT-GARDE – BUT WHEN OWENS TALKS ABOUT DUCHAMP, IT IS WITH SUCH UNABASHED EXCITEMENT THAT THE SENSE OF ANY AIRS AND GRACES ARE SWIFTLY DISSIPATED; ALLUSIONS TO HUYSMANS AND MALLARMÉ ARE MADE IN THE SAME MANNER. CANONICAL CULTURAL REFERENCING ASIDE, AND BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF THE INTIMIDATINGLY UNIFORMED ACOLYTES WHO SO OFTEN SURROUND THIS DESIGNER, OWENS’ VISION FOR HIS UNIVERSE IS REMARKABLY INCLUSIVE. WHAT THIS TRIENNALE EXHIBITION WILL OFFER IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OWENS TO BE THE AUTHOR OF HIS OWN NARRATIVE, ONE THAT OPENLY COMMUNICATES THAT SPIRIT WITH THE SAME GRACE THAT HE BOTH SPEAKS AND DESIGNS, DISMANTLES THAT GOTHIC MISNOMER AND EXPLORES THE NUANCE OF HIS CREATION. “I AM GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE WHAT I DID,” HE SAYS. “I’M LEARNING WHO I WANT TO BE, WHO I AM, HOW FAR I’VE GOTTEN, WHAT THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE. IT’S NOT HARD AT ALL. IT’S PURE PLEASURE.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

PERHAPS IT’S OVERDUE. TO SOME, RICK OWENS STILL SEEMS LIKE AN ENFANT TERRIBLE FROM THE LA UNDERGROUND, BUT FOR 23 YEARS HE HAS BEEN FORGING A RADICAL AESTHETIC IN FASHION AND BUILDING AN IMPRESSIVELY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS. AS HE PREPARES TO OPEN AN EXHIBITION FEATURING 100 ARCHIVE PIECES AT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO — UNDER THE TYPICALLY OWENS TITLE SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN — WE FIND HIM IN A SWEET SPOT: HEADING UP AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS WITH A TURNOVER IN EXCESS OF €100M A YEAR, NINE FLAGSHIP STORES, AND MENSWEAR AND WOMENSWEAR AVAILABLE IN ABOUT 800 RETAIL POINTS WORLDWIDE. IT’S DIFFICULT TO THINK OF A RADICAL INNOVATOR WITH SIMILAR STATUS IN FASHION WHO HASN’T EITHER FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE OR BEEN ABSORBED BY THE TRACTOR BEAM OF KERING OR LVMH. “I’VE HAD A FEW OFFERS IN THE PAST,” EXPLAINS OWENS FROM THE BUNKER-LIKE HQ AND HOME HE SHARES WITH HIS WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY IN THE SEVENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS. “I WAS TEMPTED IN MY FORTIES BECAUSE I WONDERED IF I’D BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THIS AS A CAREER, AND IT MIGHT BE THE MOST MONEY I’D EVER GET.” THE DESIGNER, WHO TURNED 56 THIS YEAR AND WHO MOVED FROM LA TO PARIS IN 2003, NEVER SOLD OUT. INSTEAD, HE ESTABLISHED OWENSCORP IN 2004 WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELSA LANZO AND COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR LUCA RUGGERI. BEING A VERTICAL BUSINESS IN FASHION IS INCREASINGLY COMMON IN THE MASS MARKET — BRANDS LIKE ZARA OWN AND MANAGE EVERY ASPECT OF DESIGN, MANUFACTURING AND RETAIL. THERE ARE NO MIDDLEMEN. FOR A NICHE, DIRECTIONAL LUXURY LABEL LIKE RICK OWENS, IT’S MORE UNUSUAL, BUT THE DESIGNER HAS ACHIEVED IT. “WE ABSORBED OUR MANUFACTURING INTO THE COMPANY,” OWENS EXPLAINS. “WE WERE NO LONGER LICENSING IT OUT. IN THIS BUSINESS, YOU WANT TO HAVE AS MUCH CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS [AS POSSIBLE]. ALSO, YOU GET MORE PROFIT, WHICH IS NICE. WE BOUGHT THE FACTORY WE WERE USING IN CONCORDIA, AND NOW IT’S RICK OWENS LAND — IT’S A TOTAL FORTRESS JUST FOR US.” BEFORE BECOMING A FULL VERTICAL OPERATION, THE DESIGNER’S MANUFACTURING WAS HANDLED BY A SEPARATE COMPANY, UNDER LICENCE. AFTER OWENSCORP WAS ESTABLISHED, IT CAME TO HIS ATTENTION THAT THE LICENSEE HAD USED A FACTORY IN MOLDOVA FOR CERTAIN GARMENTS, WHICH WERE THEN FINISHED IN ITALY AND SOLD WITH A “MADE IN ITALY” TAG. IT WAS COMMON AND LAWFUL PRACTICE FOR MANY LUXURY BRANDS, BUT IT MADE OWENS WANT TOTAL CONTROL. THEN THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS CHANGED AND THE GARMENTS HAD TO HAVE “MADE IN MOLDOVA” ON THE LABEL. “THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD MOMENT TO TAKE OVER MANUFACTURING,” HE SAYS. TODAY HE OWNS BOTH THE ITALIAN AND MOLDOVAN FACTORIES. HE KEPT THE LATTER BECAUSE “IT HAD BEEN OPENED EXCLUSIVELY TO CREATE RICK OWENS, AND THERE WAS NOTHING SUBSTANDARD ABOUT THE WORK. WE CURRENTLY MAKE 5 PER CENT OF OUR MERCHANDISE THERE — OUR DRKSHDW LABEL. AND THE FACTORY WILL BE FULLY SA8000 [A SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARD] CERTIFIED IN 2018.” EVEN CONSIDERING THE PROFITS, THE BENEFITS OF “GOING VERTICAL” ARE OBVIOUS: YOU CAN BE NIMBLE IN TERMS OF MATCHING MANUFACTURING NUMBERS TO WHAT’S SELLING. AND OWENS HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT THAT — HE HAS MANAGED TO REMAIN AN “INSIDER LABEL” WHILE SPINNING THE AVANT-GARDE INTO GOLD. HIS SS18 COLLECTIONS FOR MEN AND WOMEN, BOTH ENTITLED “DIRT”, SCRAMBLE BODY SHAPES WITH VOLUMES AND ZIPS. THE USE OF SPECIALLY DEVELOPED CANVAS IS A NOD TO ALL THINGS ART SCHOOL, WHILE THE SILHOUETTES ARE, AS IS NOW USUAL WITH OWENS, AKIN TO EXPERIMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL MAQUETTES. BUT WHILE THE RUNWAY AND THE SHOPFRONTS ARE FULL OF FUTURE MUSEUM PIECES, THERE ARE ALWAYS BASICS BEHIND THEM. VARIATIONS ON HIS SIMPLE BUT DISTINCTIVE VOLUMINOUS BLACK TEE AND SUPERSIZED SNEAKERS SELL IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS. “THEY’RE ALWAYS BREAD AND BUTTER,” SAYS OWENS. “TO THIS DAY, ALMOST ALL OF THE 13 PIECES FROM MY FIRST COLLECTION STILL SELL WELL. I’M PROUD OF THAT. I WAS ABLE TO CREATE SOMETHING TIMELESS.” THE RICK OWENS AESTHETIC IS THOUGHT OF AS UNCOMPROMISING AND AGGRESSIVE. AND IT IS — PURPOSELY. INDEPENDENCE BRINGS FREEDOM, WHICH HAS LET THE DESIGNER WORK ON GAY ZOMBIE MOVIES WITH FILM-MAKER BRUCE LABRUCE, AND PRODUCE A VIDEO THIS YEAR WITH THE TRANSGRESSIVE PERFORMER CHRISTEENE ENTITLED “BUTT MUSCLE”. AND YET, WHILE OWENS WORKS ON HIS AW18 DESIGNS IN HIS PARIS STUDIO — LISTENING ALTERNATELY TO JULIE LONDON AND 1990S HARDCORE TECHNO — HE EXPLAINS THE CLASSICISM BEHIND IT ALL: “MY JERSEY DRAPED PIECES ARE ALL BASED ON A LANGUID BIAS SILHOUETTE THAT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO WHEN I WAS LIVING ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. I KEEP GOING BACK TO THE 1930S, AND I STILL WATCH THOSE BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIES EVERY MORNING. THAT AESTHETIC IS EMBEDDED IN ME — IT’S A PATINA, LIKE A HOLLYWOOD SLEAZE FILTER.” AS RICK OWENS CHANGES HIS SHAPES SEASON AFTER SEASON, THAT MIX OF THE DECO DRAPE AND THE STREET URCHINS OF SUNSET BOULEVARD UNDERPIN EVERYTHING. IT’S LIKE GARDENIA WITH A TWIST OF AMYL NITRATE. HE’S NO LONGER THE PUNK UPSTART, HE’S THE NEW ESTABLISHMENT — A 21ST-CENTURY YVES SAINT LAURENT. WITH HIS CAREER — WHICH INCORPORATES LIMITED-EDITION FURNITURE AS WELL AS THE AFOREMENTIONED MUSICAL AND CINEMATIC PROJECTS — AT FULL THROTTLE, WHY A RETROSPECTIVE NOW, AT THIS PRECISE MOMENT? SITTING IN HIS ATELIER, SIFTING THROUGH MOUNTAINS OF OLD SHOW INVITATIONS AND EPHEMERA, HE EXPLAINS: “I HAD BEEN LOOKING AT MY ARCHIVES, AND THEY WERE SHAMBOLIC. I WONDERED WHY I NEVER HAD THE SELF-CONFIDENCE TO BELIEVE WE WOULD LAST. BUT BACK THEN IT WAS ABOUT SURVIVAL RATHER THAN LEGACY. AND THEN I WAS OFFERED THIS BEAUTIFUL 1930S BUILDING IN MILAN, WHICH IS RIGHT UP MY STREET, ARCHITECTURALLY. I’M NOT SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO BE REPRESENTED, AND THEY WERE OFFERING ME THE CHANCE TO SUMMARISE MY OWN STORY IN MY OWN WORDS. I COULDN’T THINK OF A MORE IDEAL SCENARIO.” RICK OWENS CONTINUES TO DO THINGS HIS OWN WAY. YOU CAN BUY IT OR NOT. PLENTY OF PEOPLE ARE DOING THE FORMER AROUND THE WORLD. DON’T EXPECT HIM TO BECOME ABSORBED INTO THE CORPORATE TORNADO OF FASHION AND START CREATING LOGO T-SHIRTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. “I’M DEFINITELY NOT SELLING THE COMPANY ANY TIME SOON,” HE SAYS. “I DON’T NEED THE MONEY.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

WHATEVER HE WANTS - DECEMBER 15 2017 - BY HETTIE JUDAH YOU ENTER THE RICK OWENS EXHIBITION AT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO THROUGH A TALL NOTCH SLICED FROM A WHITE WALL ANGLED LIKE A ZIGGURAT. WITHIN, A DARKENED ANTECHAMBER HAS A BACKSTAGE VIBE. TWO COLUMNS OF SPOTLIGHTS MOUNTED ON A SCAFFOLDING ARCH FACE OFF, CREATING A WALL OF LIGHT BEAMS THROUGH WHICH YOU CROSS, AS IF PASSING THROUGH A FINAL CHECK BEFORE STEPPING OUT ONTO THE RUNWAY. &quot;SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN&quot; IS THE FIRST RETROSPECTIVE IN MR. OWENS&#39;S 23-YEAR FASHION CAREER. THE RUNWAY ATMOSPHERE IS NOT COINCIDENTAL, MR. OWENS SAID. ON THE ONE HAND, THE INTROSPECTION THAT GOES INTO A SELF-CURATED RETROSPECTIVE DICTATES THAT &quot;THIS IS KIND OF A PORTENTOUS, SIGNIFICANT MOMENT.&quot; ON THE OTHER: &quot;IT&#39;S ALSO ANOTHER SHOW, AND I DO FOUR SHOWS A YEAR. IF I DIDN&#39;T, SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE A LOT MORE INTENSE, PROBABLY. IT&#39;S KIND OF A SHOW OF ALL MY SHOWS.&quot; ICY-CRISP WINTER DAYLIGHT COURSES THROUGH HIGH WINDOWS IN THE EXHIBITION PROPER, WHICH OPENS WITH A GROUP OF WHITE-CLAD MANNEQUINS ON RAISED PLATFORMS. THEIR DRESS IS RICK OWENS CLASSICAL - DRAPED, TWISTED AND PLEATED GRECIAN ROBES QUEERED WITH HORSEHAIR, BEATEN LAMBSKIN AND OUTSIZE BUGLE BEADS. THE ATMOSPHERE IS CYBER-TEMPLE: MADAME GRÈS GOES &quot;STAR WARS.&quot; UNDERCUTTING THIS ETHEREAL ATMOSPHERE IS AN OMINOUS BLACK GLOBULAR FORM THAT BURSTS THROUGH THE FRONT WALL AND STREAMS IN SERPENTINE COILS THROUGH THE 330-FOOT LENGTH OF THE TRIENNALE&#39;S HORSESHOE-SHAPED GALLERY. THIS SCULPTURAL INTRUSION IS, IN PART, A REFERENCE TO MR. OWENS&#39;S NOTORIOUS PRONOUNCEMENT, MADE SOME 20 YEARS AGO, THAT HE WOULD &quot;LAY A BLACK GLITTERING TURD ON THE WHITE LANDSCAPE OF CONFORMITY.&quot; SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING BY METAL CABLES, THE STRUCTURE ITSELF CONTAINS A WITCHY AMALGAM OF CONCRETE, CRUSHED LILIES, SAND FROM VENICE AND WADS OF THE DESIGNER&#39;S OWN HAIR. FOR 30 YEARS, MR. OWENS HAS STORED THE SHED HAIR FROM HIS BRUSH. IN ITSELF IT IS, HE SAID, ANOTHER KIND OF CREATED OBJECT. &quot;MY HAIR IS NATURALLY CURLY AND WHITE. I WANTED CHER HAIR. I WANTED JOE DALLESANDRO HAIR. I WANTED JOE DALLESANDRO ABS. I DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY OF THAT STUFF, AND I MADE IT HAPPEN. I GOT A TRAINER, I TOOK STEROIDS, I WENT TO THE GYM FOR YEARS, I GOT THE ABS, I STRAIGHTENED THE TEETH, I STRAIGHTENED THE HAIR WITH CHEMICALS, I DYED IT. IT&#39;S A SELF-INVENTION. THIS IS MY DRAG. I MADE THIS.&quot; IN THE MILAN SUNLIGHT, MR. OWENS&#39;S HAIR HAS THE IMPROBABLE BLACK SHEEN OF LABORATORY CARBON. SLIM AND TANNED TO THE TIPS OF HIS EARLOBES, HE IS BUNDLED UP AGAINST THE COLD IN A HIGH-NECK CASHMERE SWEATER AND PODLIKE DUVET COAT. HE CHEWS GUM AND EMITS THE DELICIOUS SMELL OF AESOP FACE CREAM. THE COILING BLACK STRUCTURE WAS, THE DESIGNER SAID, HIS FIRST IDEA WHEN THE TRIENNALE OFFERED HIM THIS SPACE, THOUGH HE ADMITS: &quot;IT&#39;S SO FIRST DEGREE&quot; THAT HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, &quot;THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY DUMB TO USE IT.&quot; THE SNAKING SCULPTURE ALSO REFLECTS MR. OWENS&#39;S CURRENT INTEREST IN MONUMENTAL WORKS OF LAND ART BY MICHAEL HEIZER AND RICHARD LONG. (IT&#39;S A GENRE THAT&#39;S &quot;ABOUT LEAVING YOUR MARK, WRESTLING WITH THE WORLD, SHAKING YOUR FIST AGAINST THE SKY AND SAYING &#39;I&#39;M GOING TO CONTROL YOU,&#39;&quot; HE SAID.) WHILE IT&#39;S AN UNCONVENTIONAL INCLUSION IN AN EXHIBITION OF FASHION AND FURNITURE DESIGN, THE STRUCTURE SERVES A NUMBER OF INTERESTING FUNCTIONS, BREAKING UP THE SPACE, STEERING VISITORS AND OFFERING AN EARTHY, ABJECT COUNTERPOINT TO SUCH CHERISHED QUALITIES AS BEAUTY, ELEGANCE AND REFINEMENT. MR. OWENS RETURNS OFTEN TO THE IDEA OF EQUILIBRIUM. IT&#39;S A THEME HE SEES UNDERSCORING HIS LIFE AND WORK, IN WHICH HE POSITIONS HIMSELF AS A COUNTERBALANCE TO JOYLESS AND CONSERVATIVE TENDENCIES. HE FIGHTS HARD AGAINST BINARIES AND CONVENTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE PREVALENT WITHIN HIS OWN INDUSTRY. &quot;I THINK JUDGING PEOPLE ON THEIR APPEARANCE UNFAVORABLY IS THE KERNEL OF INTOLERANCE AND BIGOTRY,&quot; HE SAID. IF HE CAN MAKE &quot;THE STRICT RULES ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO LOOK LIKE A BIT MORE FLEXIBLE, THEN THAT&#39;S MY ROLE.&quot; IN THE SAME BREATH, HE ADMITS THAT HE IS &quot;AS JUDGMENTAL AS ANYBODY. &quot;I TALK ABOUT PEOPLE JUDGING - I&#39;M THE WORST. I KNOW BOTH SIDES OF IT, AND I JUDGE MYSELF FOR JUDGING.&quot; MR. OWENS, WHO WAS BORN IN CALIFORNIA, STUDIED PAINTING AND SCULPTURE AT WHAT IS NOW OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE PURSUING A TECHNICAL QUALIFICATION IN PATTERN-CUTTING AND DRAPING. THE ACT OF HAND-MAKING IS, HE ASSURED ME, STILL HIS DAY-TO-DAY. AN HOURLONG VIDEO, FIRST PRESENTED AT AN EXHIBITION OF HIS FURNITURE DESIGN AT MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART, LOS ANGELES, IN 2016, SHOWS HIM CREATING A GARMENT FROM SCRATCH ON A MANNEQUIN. &quot;I TOOK THE VIDEO JUST WITH MY PHONE, AND IT ENDED UP BEING ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS THAT I&#39;VE EVER DONE,&quot; HE SAID. &quot;BUT THAT WAS JUST LUCK: YOU ONLY DRAPE SOMETHING GOOD ONE OUT OF 50 TIMES.&quot; FROM A CREATIVE PERSPECTIVE, HE DOES NOT, HE ADMITS, WORK WELL WITH OTHERS: &quot;I DON&#39;T HAVE A TEAM OF DESIGNERS,&quot; HE SAID. &quot;I DON&#39;T WANT TO HAVE A DEBATE, I DON&#39;T WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. I&#39;M NOT GOOD AT SHARING. I WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE SO I JUST AUTOMATICALLY GET POLITE. I GET PASSIVE. AS A GROUP, THAT WOULD NEVER WORK CREATIVELY - IT CAN ONLY BE A COMPLETE DICTATORSHIP.&quot; THE TRIENNALE, BUILT IN 1933, IS AN EXCELLENT VESSEL FOR MR. OWENS&#39;S DESIGNS. HE&#39;S A BIG FAN OF PRE-CODE HOLLYWOOD EPICS AND DESCRIBES, EXCITEDLY, BOTH THE ART DECO ELEGANCE AND &quot;LURID FUN&quot; OF CECIL B. DEMILLE&#39;S 1932 FILM, &quot;THE SIGN OF THE CROSS,&quot; HIGHLIGHTS OF WHICH INCLUDE &quot;VIRGINS BEING EATEN BY CROCODILES&quot; AND &quot;A SEQUENCE OF GIANT WOMEN FIGHTING AFRICAN PYGMIES, WHICH IS SO DELICIOUSLY POLITICALLY INCORRECT.&quot; THERE&#39;S MORE &quot;LURID FUN&quot; IN A SET OF VITRINES LOADED WITH SHOW INVITATIONS, CATALOGS AND EPHEMERA. THESE INCLUDE GAUNTLETS APPARENTLY STITCHED FROM SHED SNAKESKIN, AND A HAIRY, RING-SHAPED, &quot;GOAT EYE&quot; SEX ACCESSORY PRESENTED IN A WALLET OF BLEACHED TOAD SKIN. THERE IS, HE SAID, NO SEQUENCE TO IT: &quot;IT&#39;S ALL MIXED TOGETHER, JUST A COMPOSITION OF HOW I WOULD WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY&#39;S LIFE LAID OUT. I WANT TO SEE AN IKEBANA FLOWER ARRANGEMENT. I DON&#39;T WANT A TEXTBOOK.&quot; DESPITE MY REPEATED REQUESTS, MR. OWENS NEVER DETAILED THE THEMES, STRUCTURE OR NARRATIVE OF &quot;SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN&quot; FOR ME. IT WAS ONLY MUCH LATER THAT I REALIZED I HAD BEEN ASKING THE WRONG QUESTION, USING THE WRONG LANGUAGE. THESE CONVENTIONS OF EXHIBITION-MAKING ARE JUST THAT - CONVENTIONS - AND AS SUCH THEY FALL OUTSIDE OF MR. OWENS&#39;S NATIVE VOCABULARY. INSTEAD, THE SHOW SEEMS TO BE STRUCTURED ACCORDING TO … WELL, GUT INSTINCT. HE WORRIES A LITTLE ABOUT HOW HIS EXCREMENTAL SCULPTURE WILL BE READ. &quot;PEOPLE ARE SO SENSITIVE NOW,&quot; HE SAID. &quot;A LOT OF TIMES, PEOPLE SAY THE THINGS THAT I DO ARE TRANSGRESSIVE OR SHOCKING, AND I THINK, &quot;DOESN&#39;T THIS GENERATION REMEMBER DADAISM OR SURREALISM OR CUBISM?&#39;&quot; MR. OWENS SAID THAT HE HABITUALLY REJECTS THE IDEA THAT FASHION MIGHT BE ART. IN THIS EXHIBITION OF GARMENTS THAT RADICALLY RECONFIGURE THE HUMAN BODY, FOOTWEAR THAT ACCEPTS NO LOGIC OF WHAT A SHOE MIGHT BE AND UNCOZY FURNITURE, DADAISM DOES SEEM AN APT POINT OF REFERENCE. WRITING IN A 1916 MANIFESTO, THE ARTIST AND POET TRISTAN TZARA PROCLAIMED THAT &quot;DADA IS LIFE WITH NEITHER BEDROOM SLIPPERS NOR PARALLELS.&quot; ONE COULD SAY MUCH THE SAME FOR THE VISION OF LIFE DELIVERED BY RICK OWENS.

AS ANY SELF-RESPECTING RICK OWENS FAN WILL KNOW, TODAY MARKS THE OPENING OF SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN, THE ANTICIPATED RETROSPECTIVE OF THE INIMITABLE DESIGNER&#39;S WORK AT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO, COMPRISING GARMENTS AND ACCESSORIES FROM HIS SEMINAL ARCHIVE, ALONGSIDE FURNITURE, GRAPHICS, FILMED FOOTAGE AND OTHER OBJECTS REALISED OVER THE COURSE OF HIS PROLIFIC 23-YEAR CAREER. &quot;I WANTED TO BE THE NARRATOR OF MY STORY,&quot; OWENS TELLS US OVER EMAIL, IN HIS SIGNATURE BLOCK CAPITALS, SHORTLY BEFORE THE SHOW&#39;S UNVEILING. &quot;I WOULDN&#39;T HAVE DONE IT UNLESS I COULD.&quot; THIS IS HARDLY SURPRISING: THE DESIGNER IS NATURALLY PROTECTIVE OVER HIS EVER-EXPANDING EMPIRE AND ITS UNIQUE VERNACULAR, HAVING PERSONALLY DESIGNED EVERY PRODUCT SOLD UNDER HIS NAME SINCE THE LAUNCH OF HIS THEN-LA-BASED FASHION LABEL IN 1994. IN AN EXCLUSIVE SHORT FILM DOCUMENTING THE SHOW&#39;S INSTALLATION, WE GET A MONOCHROMATIC SNEAK PEEK AT WHAT TO EXPECT: A TRIBE OF HEADLESS MANNEQUINS APPEAR TO FLOAT IN MID-AIR LIKE GRACEFUL SPECTRES, CLAD IN FLOOR-LENGTH DRESSES EMBODYING THE IMMACULATE ATTENTION TO DRAPE, TEXTURE AND SILHOUETTE WITH WHICH OWENS HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS; THE DESIGNER SCRUPULOUSLY PERUSES A MUSEUM DISPLAY CASE LITTERED WITH PREPARATORY SKETCHES AND A MYSTERIOUS SWATHE OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE HUMAN HAIR (MORE ON THAT BELOW); RAYS OF LIGHT ILLUMINATE A BILLOWING CLOUD OF DRY ICE. IT&#39;S AN ENIGMATIC PREVIEW, BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS AS IF THE VISIONARY CREATIVE HAS BEEN DREAMING UP AN EXPERIENCE TO RIVAL THAT OF HIS MESMERIC RUNWAY SPECTACLES, HIS AIM, HE HAS REVEALED, TO CONTINUE HIS INTERROGATION OF &quot;IDEAS OF BEAUTY AND ACCEPTABILITY WITHIN OUR SOCIETY&quot;, WHILE EXPLORING THE EVOLUTION OF HIS CREATIVITY AND THE IDEAS AND ICONS THAT HAVE INSPIRED IT. WE CATCH UP WITH OWENS TO FIND OUT MORE ON WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. WHY DID NOW FEEL LIKE THE RIGHT MOMENT FOR YOUR RETROSPECTIVE? RICK OWENS: WELL, IT&#39;S NOT LIKE YOU MAKE A PROCLAMATION: &#39;I AM READY FOR MY RETROSPECTIVE NOW&#39; - SOMEONE NEEDS TO INVITE YOU, AND MILAN INVITED ME. BUT THANKS FOR THE IMPLICATION THAT I WAS DECLINING A FLOOD OF OFFERS BEFORE SETTLING ON THIS ONE. CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOUR CHOICE OF TITLE FOR THE SHOW? RICK OWENS: IT&#39;S AN ATTRACTIVELY ROBOTIC TERM THAT REFERENCES THE SELF DOUBTS, HIGHS, LOWS AND SELF-DELUSIONS WE ALL FORGIVE OURSELVES FOR EVERY DAY. WHAT WAS THE PROCESS LIKE OF LOOKING BACK RETROSPECTIVELY OVER YOUR WORK - BOTH PRACTICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY? RICK OWENS: DELICIOUS. EDITING YOUR OUTPUT SO YOU ONLY COME OUT IN THE MOST FAVOURABLE LIGHT IS SUPER SATISFYING. OBVIOUSLY IT&#39;S A MOMENT RIPE FOR GAUGING THE MEANING AND ARC OF YOUR LIFE BUT I&#39;M NOT THAT COMPLEX SO I DON&#39;T LET MYSELF INDULGE IN THAT TOO MUCH. I COULD GET MELANCHOLY AND PONDER MY DECLINE BUT I PREFER TO WALLOW IN PLEASURE LIKE A PIG IN S IT. WHAT STRUCK YOU MOST ABOUT THE PATH YOU&#39;VE TAKEN AND THE WAY YOUR CREATIVE PRACTICE HAS EVOLVED? RICK OWENS: IT GOES BY SO FAST. STUFF THAT FELT LIKE I DID IT YESTERDAY HAPPENED OVER TEN YEARS AGO. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT EVERYTHING I MADE, IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THEY WOULD TURN OUT THAT WAY… FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. WHAT WERE YOUR KEY AIMS IN TERMS OF THE CURATION, AND THE WAY VIEWERS WILL EXPERIENCE THE PIECES ON DISPLAY? RICK OWENS: LIKE EVERY SHOW I DO I WANTED IT TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF THE VALUES AND INFLUENCES I BELIEVE IN, ARRANGED IN A GRACEFUL COMPOSITION THAT SUGGEST AN APPRECIATION OF RITUAL, ORDER AND HUMANITY. WITH A RIDICULOUS FLOURISH THROWN IN EVERY NOW AND THEN. YOU&#39;VE ALWAYS PIONEERED BEAUTY AND HOPE THROUGH YOUR WORK. WHY IS THAT? RICK OWENS: I DIDN&#39;T LIKE BEING TOLD THERE WAS A SET OF RULES IN BEHAVIOR OR APPEARANCE THAT WERE A SET STANDARD TO FOLLOW. REJECTING PEOPLE BASED ON APPEARANCE IS THE KERNEL OF BIGOTRY AND INTOLERANCE. THIS IS PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION AND THOSE RULES WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR BUT I FEEL MY ROLE IS TO TRY AND BALANCE THEM OUT BY SUGGESTING A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY… TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NEW SCULPTURAL INSTALLATION? RICK OWENS: I CALL IT A PRIMAL HOWL OF EGO, RAGE, ASPIRATION, FATALISM AND JOY. ITS AN EARTHWORK COMPOSED OF CONCRETE, LILIES, ADRIATIC SAND AND THE WADS OF MY HAIR I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING OVER THE YEARS. THE WORKING TITLE WE USED DURING ITS CONSTRUCTION IS TURDNADO.

RICK OWENS CAN DEFINITELY BE COUNTED AS ONE OF THE FEW. THIS IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE &quot;RICK OWENS. SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN&quot; EXHIBITION, WHICH OPENS FRIDAY AT MILAN&#39;S TRIENNALE DESIGN MUSEUM. DESIGNED AND CURATED BY OWENS HIMSELF, THE IMPRESSIVE RETROSPECTIVE, HOUSED IN A CURVED ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE THIRTIES MUSEUM, OFFERS AN EXTENSIVE SUMMARY OF THE DESIGNER&#39;S 20-YEAR OEUVRE, WHICH ACTUALLY SPANS FROM FASHION TO ART AND DESIGN. ALONG WITH HIGHLIGHTING KEY PIECES OF HIS FASHION COLLECTIONS, THE EXHIBITION, WHICH WELCOMES VISITORS THROUGH A THEATRICAL FOG-LIKE HAZE, ALSO DISPLAYS THE DESIGNER&#39;S INTERIOR DESIGN PIECES, SUCH AS A RANGE OF WOODEN CHAIRS COVERED WITH SUPERSOFT CAMEL HAIR IN A SOPHISTICATED AND WARM AMBER TONE, AND FEATURES VIDEOS OF HIS RUNWAY SHOWS. WHILE CLOTHES ARE DISPLAYED ON MANNEQUINS LOCATED ON PODIUMS, A STUNNING SUSPENDED ORGANIC SCULPTURE MADE BY OWENS GUIDES VISITORS THROUGH THE EXHIBIT&#39;S ENTIRE PATH. WWD: SO HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PUT TOGETHER THE SELECTION FOR THE EXHIBITION? R.O.: WE HAD TO RE-CREATE A LOT OF THINGS. MAYBE 20 PERCENT OF THE CLOTHES HAD TO BE RECREATED AND MAYBE 30 PERCENT WAS VERY RECENT, SO THERE&#39;S NOT A LOT OF REALLY OLD STUFF. THERE ARE A LOT OF RECENT THINGS, OF COURSE, BECAUSE THEY WERE THE EASIEST TO GET. BUT THERE IS A GOOD SUMMARY OF THE MOST RECENT THINGS AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS STUFF PUT TOGETHER YOU DEFINITELY HAVE A SUMMARY OF YOUR LIFE. WWD: WAS THERE SOMETHING EMOTIONAL ABOUT DOING THIS JOURNEY THROUGH YOUR CAREER? R.O.: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN, IF I WOULDN&#39;T DO SHOWS FOUR TIMES A YEAR. IT WOULD BE EMOTIONAL IF I WASN&#39;T IN SHOW MODE ALL THE TIME. I&#39;M ALWAYS IN SHOW MODE IN A WAY, IT&#39;S ALWAYS ABOUT TRYING TO FIND THE MOST HONEST, INTIMATE, MOST PERSONAL EXPRESSION I CAN. SO I&#39;M KIND OF USED TO THINKING IN THAT WAY. IT&#39;S NOT ACTUALLY TAKING ME BY SURPRISE. WWD: WAS IT VERY DIFFERENT FROM MAKING THE EDIT FOR A FASHION SHOW? R.O.: IT WAS THE SAME, ACTUALLY. IT WAS A COMPOSITION OF A LOT OF ELEMENTS…THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT WITH THIS KIND OF SHOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT ARE NOT AS MUCH UNDER MY CONTROL…I HAD TO GIVE THE EXECUTION TO OTHER PEOPLE. SO FOLLOWING THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN FOLLOWING A FABRIC MANUFACTURER. IT IS A DIFFERENT SET OF TOOLS. SO IT MADE THAT HARDER, BUT IT MADE IT FUN TOO. WWD: LET’S TALK ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE SCULPTURE YOU ASSEMBLED FOR THE EXHIBITION. R.O.: MY FAVORITE ARTISTS ARE USUALLY LAND ARTISTS LIKE MICHAEL HEIZER, OR RICHARD BLUNT, OR RICHARD SERRA AND JOSEPH BEUYS. WHEN THEY GAVE ME A BIG, BEAUTIFUL WHITE SPACE THE FIRST THING I WANTED WAS TO INVADE IT IN A VERY PRIMAL, FUNDAMENTAL, PRIMITIVE WAY, THE BRUTALIST WAY. AND DOING A LAND PIECE OR EARTH WORK IS WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HAVE LOOKED MOST BEAUTIFUL, ALSO CONSIDERING THE SPACE. I THOUGHT IT NEEDED A BRUTALIST, PRIMAL GESTURE. AND I LIKE TO KEEP THINGS KIND OF SIMPLE BUT BIG…PUTTING THIS KIND OF BRUTALIST EARTH WORK IN HERE WAS KIND OF SENDING A MESSAGE, A VERY EASY, FAST MESSAGE TO ABSORB. IT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS ALL THE DRIVE THAT IT TAKES ANYONE TO EXPRESS ANYTHING AND THE MOTIVATIONS FOR THAT DRIVE ARE EGO, REACTION, AMBITION, ASPIRATION, THE QUEST FOR IMMORTALITY…THERE ARE ALL THESE FORCES WHICH ARE GOOD OR BAD AND THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. THAT IS WHAT IT REALLY REPRESENTS — THIS HUMAN DRIVE, THE GOOD AND THE BAD. AND IT ALSO IS WHAT MY CLOTHES ARE ABOUT…IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT ALL THE REAL THINGS WE ALL EXPERIENCE. WWD: WHAT IS THE SCULPTURE MADE OF? R.O.: IT’S MADE OF CONCRETE AND I PUT LILIES IN IT, CRUSHED LILIES. I’VE LIVED IN VENICE [FOR] HALF A YEAR AND SO IT ALSO HAS ADRIATIC SAND FROM THE BEACH BECAUSE I PLAN TO BE BURIED IN VENICE AND SO IT’S KIND OF MY HOME SAND AND IT HAS MY HAIR, LIKE OUT OF MY BRUSH. MY HAIR, YOU KNOW, OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN FALLING OUT. I USED TO HAVE VERY THICK, BEAUTIFUL HAIR; NOW IT’S THIN AND SLEAZY, WHICH I LOVE, TOO. OVER THE YEARS I’VE GOTTEN A LOT OF HAIR, AND IT’S WEIRD, I WANTED TO SAVE FOR SOMETHING AND THIS CAME UP…JUST PERFECT. SO THERE’S MY HAIR IN THAT. WWD: WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE SCULPTURE WHEN THE EXHIBITION WILL BE OVER [ON MARCH 25]? R.O.: WE WON’T THROW IT AWAY. WE’LL KEEP IT IN OUR SHOWROOM IN PARIS. WWD: ARE YOU ALREADY PLANNING TO BRING THIS EXHIBITION SOMEWHERE ELSE? R.O.: NO PLANS. IF IT IS THE ONLY RETROSPECTIVE THAT I’LL EVER DO IN MY LIFE, IT’S TOTALLY FINE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I’M ONLY 56 SO I GUESS THAT IF I CAN KEEP MAKING THINGS MAYBE SOMEONE WILL HAVE ANOTHER ONE. BUT IT’S VERY FULFILLING TO BE ABLE TO WRITE YOUR OWN STORY, INSTEAD OF HAVE IT INTERPRETED BY SOMEONE ELSE. IF SOMEONE SAYS, “WE WILL HAVE A SHOW BUT IT WILL BE CURATED BY SOMEONE,” I WOULD NOT DO THAT. TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE WHAT I’VE DONE ON MY OWN SETS A STANDARD. SO I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SET A STANDARD WITH THIS. ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS WILL BE AN INTERPRETATION THAT IS UN-DEFINITIVE…WHICH IS GOOD, I LIKE THAT. I WAS ABLE TO DO IT IN MY OWN WAY AND AFTER THIS IT DOESN’T MATTER. WWD: HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE PUBLIC TO REACT TO THE EXHIBITION, WHICH IS DEFINITELY PRETTY INTENSE AND DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY ARE USED TO SEEING IN MILAN? R.O.: I DON’T CARE, ACTUALLY. IT IS WHAT IT IS AND PEOPLE CAN INTERPRET IN THE WAY THEY NEED IT AND THEY WANT TO. I DON’T NEED TO DIRECT EVERYTHING. IT’S ALL JUST A PROPOSAL. IT’S A GENTLE PROPOSAL. IN EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE, I NEVER WANTED TO SAY, “MY WAY IS THE ONLY WAY” AND THAT MY AESTHETIC IS THE ONLY WAY, BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT I HAVE RESISTED MY WHOLE LIFE. THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT I’VE ALWAYS DONE – [MY WORK IS] A REACTION TO AN AESTHETIC WORLD, A SPECIFIC SORT OF AESTHETIC I WAS FORCED TO ADAPT WHEN I WAS YOUNG. I WAS RAISED IN A VERY CONSERVATIVE AREA, IT WAS VERY RESTRICTIVE AND VERY OPPRESSIVE. [IT WAS ALL ABOUT] AESTHETIC RULES AND BEHAVIORS… MY REACTION WAS TO PROPOSE OTHER OPTIONS AND, WHEN I PROPOSE OTHER OPTIONS, I DON’T PROPOSE THEM AS ALTERNATIVES, I PROPOSE THEM AS OPTIONS. ALSO, I’M SAYING “THE RULES ARE VERY RIGID, WHAT ABOUT SOME FLEXIBILITY?” AND I SUGGEST WAY TO BE FLEXIBLE AND THAT’S WHAT MY WORK IS ABOUT… IT’S ABOUT FLEXIBILITY, IT’S ABOUT EMPATHY, IT’S ABOUT TOLERANCE AND IT’S ABOUT KINDNESS. I KNOW THAT IN MY WORK PEOPLE SEE A LOT OF DARKNESS, POST APOCALYPTIC…BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL MORE UTOPIAN THAN POST-APOCALYPTIC. BUT I GET IT…IT’S EASY TO SEE THE DRAMA AND YOU KNOW, I LOVE DRAMA. AND WE ARE IN MILAN, THE CITY OF OPERA AND WHAT’S MORE DRAMATIC THAN OPERA? WHO CAN RESPOND BETTER? MILAN IS A TOUGH AUDIENCE, I MEAN FOR FASHION…SO TO BE ACCEPTED IN MILAN IS PRETTY FLATTERING. WWD: DO YOU LIKE MILAN? R.O.: I LOVE MILAN. EVERYTHING EVERYBODY CRITICIZES MILAN FOR, THE GRAYNESS AND THE SEVERITY, IS DEFINITELY WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT. AND, FOR EXAMPLE, ALL OF THE PLANTS HANGING OFF THE BALCONIES, THEY DO IT IN SUCH A DIFFERENT WAY THAN PARIS, IT HAS A KIND OF SHAGGY QUALITY THAT I LOVE. WWD: ARE YOU EXPECTING FRIENDS TO COME AND CELEBRATE THE OPENING WITH YOU? R.O.: I DON’T HAVE MANY FRIENDS IN MILAN. I DON’T HAVE MANY FRIENDS PERIOD. I’M A TERRIBLE FRIEND, I’M NOT VERY ATTENTIVE, I DON’T REMEMBER ANYBODY’S BIRTHDAY.[…]I’M NOT ON FACEBOOK, I DON’T FOLLOW ANYONE ON INSTAGRAM. I JUST BELIEVE IN BEING POLITE, I BELIEVE IN BEING KIND IN EVERYTHING, BUT I THINK I’M VERY RECLUSIVE. I’M MORE COMFORTABLE BY MYSELF. I’M VERY FOCUSED AND I HAVE A LOT TO DO, I HAVE MICHELLE [HIS WIFE]. I REALLY DON’T NEED A LOT, I DON’T NEED A LOT OF STIMULATION. SO YES, I’M A TERRIBLE FRIEND. I DON’T REALLY NURTURE RELATIONSHIPS VERY WELL. BUT YOU KNOW, I LEARNT THAT THAT’S OK. I WAS THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING THIS MORNING…THE IDEA OF, “YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.” AND I SAY, “WHY?” BUT I DO REALIZE IN MY PERSONAL LIFE THAT I PROTECT MY COMFORT ZONE BECAUSE I PUSH MYSELF SO MUCH IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. I’M SO SELF-CRITICAL IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE THAT I ALWAYS SAY TO MYSELF, “YOU HAVE TO LEARN MORE, YOU HAVE TO GO FURTHER, YOU HAVE TO TAKE MORE RISKS.” AND ACTUALLY I WANT TO GO AS DEEP AS POSSIBLE IN WHAT I DO, I WANT TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE.

HIS FIRST-EVER RETROSPECTIVE — HIGHLIGHTING THE FULL RANGE OF HIS CREATIVITY, FROM CLOTHES AND ACCESSORIES TO FURNITURE DESIGN AND VISUAL RECORDS OF THE OFTEN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE PIECES THAT PASS FOR FASHION SHOWS IN HIS MULTIVERSE — OPENED AT THE TRIENNALE IN MILAN, WHERE IT WILL BE ON DISPLAY UNTIL MARCH 25. OWENS SAYS HE’D PROBABLY HAVE FELT MORE EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE EXHIBITION IF IT HADN’T BEEN SHOE-HORNED INTO HIS ANNUAL FOUR-SHOW SCHEDULE. “IT FELT FAMILIAR, LIKE ANOTHER SHOW.” THEN HE HAD TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE PRESS, AND HE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE IN HIS EAR, SAYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER. “THE MORE I TALK ABOUT IT, THE MORE REDUNDANT I SOUND.” SO, A FEW DAYS LATER, HE’S HOPING THE PASSAGE OF TIME WILL EVENTUALLY BRING A LITTLE MORE OBJECTIVITY AND RESTORE THE SENSE OF SIGNIFICANCE THAT SUCH A WAY STATION DESERVES. A RETROSPECTIVE DOES, AFTER ALL, CONJURE UP A RECKONING OF A LIFE. “I LOVE THAT WORD ‘RECKONING’,” RICK PURRS. “I LOVE HOW BIBLICAL IT SOUNDS.” AND GOD REALLY IS IN THE DETAILS OF THE OWENS STORY. HIS MIDDLE NAME, FOR INSTANCE. SATURNINO! “I KNOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?” HE MARVELS. “IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXOTIC THINGS MY FATHER EVER DID. IT’S KIND OF FUNNY BECAUSE HE WAS SO CEREBRAL AND EMPIRICAL, BUT HE WAS VERY INTO ASTROLOGY. SATURNINO WAS MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER’S MIDDLE NAME ON MY MOTHER’S SIDE, AND MY FATHER LIKED IT BECAUSE HE SAID SATURN WAS IMPORTANT IN MY HOUSE.” AS FAR AS THAT GOES, OWENS INSISTS HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ASTROLOGY, BUT HE IS, FOR THE RECORD, A SCORPIO. A SATURNINE SCORPIO, TO BOOT. “I CAN SEE HOW A SATURNINE QUALITY WOULD WORK AS A DESCRIPTION FOR ME,” HE ADDS WITH A DRY CHUCKLE. “DAD PROGRAMMED ME!” THE RETROSPECTIVE IS CALLED SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN. IS THIS THE OWENS EQUIVALENT OF TITIAN’S “THREE AGES OF MAN”? “NO, IT’S MORE ABOUT SOMETHING WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON. PRIMAL URGES, CONTROLLED URGES AND DELUSIONAL MOTIVATIONS. THEY’RE THINGS I EXAMINE IN MYSELF. I’M ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT MY FLAWS: THE FLAWS I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR, THE FLAWS I USED TO PUNISH MYSELF FOR, FLAWS I CAN’T TAKE TOO SERIOUSLY ANYMORE. IT’S MY JOURNEY BUT EVERYONE GOES THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT WHO THEY ARE. I THOUGHT SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN WAS A WONDERFULLY ROBOTIC, CLINICAL PHRASE THAT REFERS TO THE MESSY EMOTIONS EVERYONE IS TRYING TO NEGOTIATE. I LOVE HOW CREEPY IT SOUNDS.” IT’S GOT A STRIDENT NOTE OF NIETZSCHE ABOUT IT TOO. “YES, YES, YES,” OWENS ENTHUSIASTICALLY AGREES. “IT STRIKES A NICE CHORD.” WHICH REMINDS ME, IN A FREE ASSOCIATIVE WAY, OF SOMETHING GORE VIDAL ONCE WROTE ABOUT THE US’S MARCH FROM BARBARISM TO DECADENCE, BYPASSING CIVILISATION ALONG THE WAY. IN THE SHOW AT THE TRIENNALE, STUNNINGLY ELEGANT, REFINED, SERENE PIECES OF CLOTHING SHARE SPACE WITH OWENS’ MONUMENTAL, BRUTALIST FURNITURE DESIGNS. AND SNAKING THROUGH THE WHOLE EXHIBITION IS A MASSIVE, CRUDE, EARTHWORM-Y SHAPE, LIKE A STRAND OF VOMITOUS PLASMA, WHICH OWENS CALLS HIS “PRIMAL HOWL,” ALMOST AN EXORCISM OF ALL THOSE FLAWS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. IF THIS ISN’T A SCREAMING MATCH — OR A HEATED CONVERSATION — BETWEEN BARBARISM AND DECADENCE, THEN IT IS AT LEAST A STUDY IN EXTREMES THE LIKES OF WHICH HAS SELDOM EVER BEEN SEEN IN FASHION. “I’M ALWAYS AIMING FOR A SERENITY AS A UTOPIAN IDEAL,” OWENS EXPLAINS, IN THE SEDUCTIVE, MEASURED DRAWL WITH WHICH HE TYPICALLY EXPRESSES HIS DARKEST, MOST CONVOLUTED THOUGHTS. “IT’S THE NEXT LEVEL, BUT I’M NEVER GOING TO GET TO IT. TO GET THERE IS MESSY, IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FEROCITY AND DRIVE. I THINK ABOUT MY EGO A LOT. WHY AM I SO DETERMINED THAT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS OF SUCH VALUE THAT I MUST INSIST PEOPLE LISTEN TO IT? IT TAKES AN UNPLEASANT AMOUNT OF EGO AND AGGRESSION TO FORCE YOURSELF INTO A POSITION WHERE PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO YOU. I’M PROUD I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT.” TRUE, THE “PRIMAL HOWL” IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE, MUCH MORE SO THAN THE EERILY LIFELIKE SCULPTURES OF OWENS THAT POPULATE HIS STORES AROUND THE WORLD. IT MAKES ME WONDER IF HE FEELS COMPELLED TO JUSTIFY HIS EXISTENCE ALL THE TIME, BY PLACING HIMSELF SO PHYSICALLY, SO INESCAPABLY IN THE WORLD HE’S CREATED. (HIS CLOTHES COULD BE SAID TO FILL THE SAME FUNCTION IN FASHION.) “NOT REALLY,” HE COUNTERS. “I FEEL A MORAL OBLIGATION TO LEAVE GOOD ENERGY BEHIND. AS LONG AS YOU’RE HERE, YOU GOTTA DO YOUR BEST. WHEN I LOOK AT ALL THOSE CLOTHES AND THINK OF ALL THAT WASTE AND HOW MUCH THIS INDUSTRY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLLUTING, I CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE FACT THAT THE WORLD NEEDS BEAUTY. THAT’S ONE OF OUR GREATEST GIFTS WHILE WE’RE ON EARTH. MY JOB IS TO PROMOTE BEAUTY AND FIND NEW VERSIONS OF IT AND PRESENT IT AND TALK ABOUT IT AND ENJOY IT AND, I SUPPOSE, PROVIDE IT. WHO AM I TO SAY WHAT’S BEAUTIFUL? I’M JUST DOING THESE PROPOSALS BUT ENOUGH PEOPLE SEEM TO ENJOY IT THAT IT MEANS IT HAS SOME VALUE. AND I THINK THAT’S IMPORTANT.” THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE I ENJOY TALKING TO IN FASHION MORE THAN RICK OWENS, BECAUSE HE IS SO TANGIBLY, DELIBERATELY A WORK IN PROGRESS, WITH ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT IMPLIES. FOR INSTANCE, HE CAN FRET ABOUT RELEVANCE, AND THEN REFLECT ON HOW MUCH HE LOVES THE NOTION OF BEING THE KIND OF EXOTIC OBSCURITY WHOM POSTERITY DELIGHTS IN UNCOVERING (THE KIND OF INDIVIDUAL WHO RENDERS RELEVANCE IRRELEVANT, IN OTHER WORDS). “I THINK I’M PROMOTING REALLY FUNDAMENTAL, ALMOST PROVINCIAL VALUES,” OWENS MUSES. “WHICH IS GOOD, BUT IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY NOW, THERE ARE MORE NUANCES. RELEVANCE IS A SMALLER WINDOW THAN IT USED TO BE. I LOVE HOW SHARP FASHION IS GETTING, HOW CRUEL AND HARD. FASHION IS ABOUT CODES THAT YOU’RE FLASHING LIKE GANG CODES, AND THE CODES ARE GETTING MORE OBSCURE. THE VIP ROOM IS GETTING SMALLER, SHUTTING DOWN AND POPPING UP IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAT ARE HARDER TO FIND. WE’RE SO OVERSATURATED WITH FASHION THAT THE CODES HAVE TO GET MORE COMPLICATED TO BE COOLER.” HE INSISTS THERE IS A NEW WAVE IN FASHION CREATING NEW CODES, BUT HE WON’T BE DRAWN ON WHO THEY ARE. “I DON’T LIKE TO SOUND LIKE I PRESUME TO KNOW WHAT THEY’RE DOING, BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THAT’S THE KIND OF IMPRESSION I’M GETTING. MAYBE I’M COMPLETELY WRONG. WHEN I MENTION THEIR NAMES TO OTHER PEOPLE, THEY SAY, ‘IMPOSSIBLE, THEY’RE TOO STUPID.’ BUT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE INSTINCTS. THEY CAN BE IDIOT SAVANTS, LIKE A BRIGHT DOG. YOU SEE DOGS THAT HAVE A SHARPNESS ABOUT THEM, A VISION, A LIGHT. PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING. I REMEMBER MY DAD MUMBLING THAT MADONNA WAS POISON TO YOUNG PEOPLE, BUT WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE RESPONDED TO HER? WHY WERE THEY SO GALVANISED, SO CAPTIVATED? IF THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE SWEPT AWAY WITH IT, IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING. THOUGH I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS EXACTLY.” OWENS HAS FAMOUSLY REMODELLED HIMSELF PHYSICALLY: THE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR STRAIGHTENED, THE GREY DYED CROW-BLACK, THE MUSCLES PUMPED AND PUMPED AGAIN, THE SKIN TANNED. HE IS A WALKING, TALKING WARRIOR FABLE OF SELF-INVENTION. BUT EVERY SO OFTEN WHEN HE’S RIDING ON THE METRO, HE’LL SEE A MAN HIS AGE (HE’S IN HIS MID-FIFTIES) AND THINK, “I’D PROBABLY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THAT GUY IF I HADN’T DECIDED I WANTED TO LOOK LIKE SOMEONE ELSE.” AND HE HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH THIS FELLOW TRAVELLER THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, IF YOU JUDGED OWENS PURELY BY HIS LOOKS OR THE LIBERTINE LIFE THAT FINDS SUCH FULSOME EXPRESSION IN HIS RETROSPECTIVE. HIS SAGE DISTILLATION OF THOSE DECADES — “AFTER YOU’VE BEEN TO ALL THE FISTF CKING CLUBS ALL OVER THE WORLD, YOU END UP IN A WALLED GARDEN WITH KITTENS AND BABIES, BECAUSE THEY’RE THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF LIFE THAT EVERYONE IDENTIFIES WITH,” — RINGS TRUE-ISH AS THE COUNSEL OF THE KIND, TRUSTWORTHY UNCLE CHARACTER HE IMAGINES HIMSELF TO BE IN POLITE COMPANY. “KINDNESS.” THAT’S HOW HE ANSWERS, WITHOUT HESITATION, WHEN I ASK WHAT HE’D LIKE TO BE REMEMBERED FOR. BUT HE IMMEDIATELY QUALIFIES HIS DECLARATION. “LURID, DEPRAVED KINDNESS. THAT’S WHAT I’M TEACHING THE KIDS. AND I GET THE FEELING THAT’S WHAT THEY’RE RESPONDING TO.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

I HAVE SENT YOU KIMONOS HE KEPT FROM HIS TIME IN JAPAN DURING WORLD WAR II WHEN HE WAS STATIONED THERE AS PART OF THE AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. I REMEMBER THESE KIMONOS FROM MY CHILDHOOD AS SOUVENIRS HE KEPT IN AN ARMY TRUNK IN THE BACK OF A CLOSET. FOR MANY YEARS HE WOULD TAKE THE PADDED BURGUNDY AND BEIGE STRIPED WINTER KIMONO OUT ON CHRISTMAS MORNING TO WEAR AS WE LISTENED TO HANDEL’S MESSIAH ON THE FLOOR OF HIS MUSIC ROOM AS HE DRANK JAPANESE TEA. HE WAS A STERN AND DISAPPROVING FIGURE, IMPATIENT WITH MY LACK OF INTELLECTUAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND MORAL DEBATING HE WANTED ME TO PARTICIPATE IN WITH HIM. I FELT HIS DISAPPOINTMENT KEENLY AND HE DIDN’T MAKE ANY EFFORT TO DISGUISE IT. HE COULD BE SOFTLY AND AMUSINGLY SARDONIC AND HAD A SINCERE KINDNESS IN HIM BUT NOT MUCH OF A FILTER WHEN IT CAME TO HIS QUIET MISANTHROPY. HE WAS BORN DURING THE AMERICAN DEPRESSION WITH HIS MOTHER DYING EARLY ON AND AN ALCOHOLIC FATHER WHO SENT HIM TO AN ORPHANAGE AT AN EARLY AGE. HE WAS VERY CONTEMPTFUL OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND PERSONAL ADORNMENT, ESPECIALLY IN AN EFFEMINATE SON. THAT’S WHY THE KIMONOS, HAND-PAINTED CALLIGRAPHIC SCROLLS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIMSELF DRESSED IN KIMONOS IN BEAUTIFUL GARDENS KEPT IN THIS MILITARY TRUNK WERE ALWAYS A SOURCE OF MYSTERY AND ALLURE TO ME — THEY WERE HINTS OF A TIME IN HIS EARLY ADULTHOOD WHEN HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF A MOMENT OF EXOTICISM AND PERSONAL ADORNMENT. THIS ISN’T TO SAY HE SUPPRESSED HIS AESTHETIC SENSITIVITY — HE HAD A LIBRARY OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE AND CLASSICAL MUSIC THAT FILLED MY CHILDHOOD… PROUST, MALLARMÉ, MAETERLINCK… WAGNER, SCHOENBERG, BARTÓK… THESE ARTISTS REPLACED THE TV HE WOULDN’T ALLOW IN THE HOUSE. AN ARRANGEMENT I RESENTED AT THE TIME BUT OF COURSE AM COMPLETELY GRATEFUL FOR NOW ALTHOUGH I DON’T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THE STRENGTH TO IMPLEMENT IF I HAD HAD CHILDREN… I RECOGNIZE HOW HE INSTILLED RIGOR AND DISCIPLINE IN MY LIFE — THE FOUNDATION OF EVERYTHING I DO AND A GREAT SOURCE OF PERSONAL SATISFACTION. HE TAUGHT ME FEAR AND SHAME, BUT WOULD I HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO REACT TO OTHERWISE? HE HAD VERY UNKIND OPINIONS ON RACE, WOMEN, AND HOMOSEXUALITY THAT I WAS ABLE TO BALANCE OUT IN MY OWN WAY IN MY OWN PERSONAL AESTHETIC EXPRESSION, WHICH INFURIATED HIM. IN LATER YEARS, AFTER I HAD BECOME RECOGNIZED AS A DESIGNER IN PARIS, HE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO ENJOY IT WITH ME BUT ULTIMATELY DISENGAGED BECAUSE OF MY UNWILLINGNESS TO DEBATE MY MORALITY, OR LACK OF IT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE. WE DIDN’T SPEAK FOR 3 YEARS UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO GO AND WE HAD A QUIET PHONE GOODBYE. WE JUST COULDN’T HELP HAVING A SENTIMENTAL AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE WERE MORTAL ENEMIES. DEAREST RICK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR LETTER. I WAS RATHER SURPRISED AT HOW INTENSE YOUR LETTER WAS; GOING INTO THE DETAILS OF YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY. I HAD ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH FASHION INDUSTRY TILL NOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I GOT TO KNOW YOUR NAME ONLY RECENTLY. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE CONCEPT OF MY PHOTOGRAPHY WOULDN’T GO WITH FASHION, OR VICE VERSA. HOWEVER, I WAS TOUCHED AND MOTIVATED WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT YOUR FATHER LEFT KIMONOS AS HIS MEMENTO. FOR BETTER OR WORSE, THE RELATIONSHIP YOU AND YOUR FATHER HAD MUST’VE AFFECTED YOUR WAY OF LIFE. I’VE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE RELATIONSHIP MATERIALIZES AS THESE KIMONOS, WHICH ALSO EMBODY THE HISTORY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND JAPAN, AS WELL AS VERY PERSONAL ONE. IN THE CONTEXT OF ETERNAL STREAM OF TIME, THESE KIMONOS (SOME SUMMER KIMONOS, RO AND SHA, WINTER ONE DOTERA), BEING RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME, NOT IN THE PAST, ARE NOW MAKING A NEW RELATIONSHIP BEYOND THE TIME. WHAT YOUR FATHER HAD LEFT HAS TURNED INTO A SILK THREAD CONNECTING YOU AND ME NOW. I STUDIED TEXTILES WHEN I WAS IN ART SCHOOL. I HAVE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE IN KIMONOS AS I USED TO DYE THREAD, WEAVE CLOTH… I STILL HAVE THE LOOM FROM BACK THEN. I FELT THE QUALITY OF YOUR WORK WAS EXTREMELY HIGH, BRILLIANTLY REFLECTING YOUR CONSISTENT THOUGHT. IN MY EYES, YOUR BODY OF WORK SEEMS TO EXPRESS BOTH ASPECTS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT, FREEDOM AND NON-FREEDOM, POSSESSION AND NON-POSSESSION, TOLERANCE AND INTOLERANCE. I AM TRULY GRATEFUL THAT THE VERY FIRST FASHION SHOOT I DID WAS RICK OWENS.

RICK OWENS — SHOWS ARE SO AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL, AND I’VE BEEN CONCENTRATING ON DOOM FOR SO LONG. BUT CULTURALLY THINGS SEEM TO BE DECLINING, SO I WAS THINKING, “HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT GRACEFULLY?” I MIGHT HAVE DRIVEN THAT MOROSE MOOD INTO THE GROUND WITH MY LAST COUPLE OF SHOWS SO I THOUGHT I’D GIVE EVERYBODY A BREAK AND THINK IN A MORE POSITIVE DIRECTION AND CONCENTRATE ON HOW THE CREATIVE EXPRESSION IS ITSELF A GESTURE OF HOPE. IT’S THE OPPOSITE OF DEATH. THE FUNNY THING IS, I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN UP ON HOPE AGAIN, AND NOW I’M JUST THINKING OF ANGER AND AGGRESSION. SVEN SCHUMANN — WHY? RICK OWENS — BECAUSE HOPE DIDN’T WORK OUT. WHEN I’M LOOKING AT THE CYCLES OF EVERYTHING THAT I’VE LIVED THROUGH, LIFE IS VERY CRUDE. AGGRESSION AND CONFLICT ARE JUST NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY, NO MATTER HOW IDEALISTIC PEOPLE CAN BE AND HOW MUCH THEY HOPE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH. PART OF IT IS: LIFE ISN’T FAIR. SO WHEN I DO A SHOW THAT’S MORE ANGRY, I FEEL LIKE IT’S ALMOST A POSITIVE RELEASE, AND I’M INVITING PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THIS RELEASE THAT WILL BLOW OVER, AND THEN WE’LL GO ON WITH THE REST OF OUR DAY, TRYING TO BE SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE. THE PROBLEM IS, SOME PEOPLE DON’T LEARN HOW TO CONTAIN ANGER AND AGGRESSION OR CONTROL IT, AND IT ERUPTS IN UNPLEASANT WAYS. SVEN SCHUMANN — WHEN DID YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTAIN IT? RICK OWENS — I DON’T KNOW IF I EVER DID! I STILL AM SURPRISED THAT IT’S PART OF MY LIFE. I CATCH MYSELF ROLLING MY EYES AT SOMETHING OR KIND OF HAVING A SNEERING ATTITUDE, AND I JUST CAN’T BELIEVE THAT I STILL HAVE THAT IN ME. I FEEL LIKE I’M MORE DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED THAN THAT, BUT I STILL HAVE MOMENTS OF PETTINESS… IT HORRIFIES ME! I REALIZED THAT THERE ARE PERSONALITY TRAITS THAT ARE JUST OUT OF OUR CONTROL. THAT SELF-ACCEPTANCE OF GIVING YOURSELF A BREAK FOR NOT BEING PERFECT BUT STILL WORKING ON IT IS IMPORTANT. SO I TRY AND THINK ABOUT BEING TRUTHFUL AND THINGS BEING LOGICAL. AND I THINK THAT’S MY VERSION OF RELEVANCE. SVEN SCHUMANN — DO YOU STILL CONSCIOUSLY THINK ABOUT HOW TO STAY RELEVANT WITH YOUR WORK? RICK OWENS — I DON’T KNOW IF I’M IN THE CONVERSATION OF IMMEDIATE POPULAR CULTURE BECAUSE I’M NOT THAT FAMILIAR, I’M NOT THAT ENGAGED WITH IT. BUT WHAT I AM ENGAGED WITH ARE KIND OF ETERNAL VALUES THAT I THINK EVERYBODY STRUGGLES WITH INTERNALLY. I’M AWARE OF STAYING RELEVANT. I’M AWARE THAT I PUT STUFF OUT THERE, AND I WANT IT TO SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE AND SOMETHING LOGICAL. I USE THE WORD “LOGIC” AS MY WORD FOR RELEVANCE. SVEN SCHUMANN — DOES THAT FORM OF LOGIC ALSO APPLY TO THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT THE FASHION INDUSTRY AT LARGE? RICK OWENS — I DON’T REALLY THINK ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AT ALL. EVER! IN A WAY, I’M NOT REALLY PART OF IT. I AM ON THE FRINGES, I THINK. THERE’S BEEN A TURNING POINT — NOW I FEEL LIKE AN ELDER STATESMAN, WHEREAS BEFORE I WAS KIND OF A WILD CARD OR SOMETHING. I THINK PARTLY THAT HAS TO DO WITH SO MANY TRANSITIONS BEING THROWN AROUND IN THE INDUSTRY. NOW IT’S ALL ABOUT PEOPLE BEING CHEWED UP AND SPAT OUT AND NOT EVEN RECYCLED — REPLACED WITH NEWER AND BETTER… IT’S THIS FURIOUS, FURIOUS BLENDER. LIKE ONE OF THOSE KITCHEN MIXERS. I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE LIKE ME. I END UP TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE NOW BECAUSE I’M NOT PART OF THAT WORLD. AND I’M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS YET, AND I’M NOT SURE IF IT’S GOOD OR IF IT’S BAD. SVEN SCHUMANN — DO YOU STILL FEEL A CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD YOUR CUSTOMERS? RICK OWENS — OH, ABSOLUTELY! ALTHOUGH I’M SURE MANY WOULD ROLL THEIR EYES AT THAT, HAVING SEEN MY LAST SHOWS. YEARS AGO, I SWORE I WOULD NEVER SHOW SOMETHING ON THE RUNWAY THAT I DIDN’T THINK WAS A PRACTICAL WAY OF DRESSING. BUT THINGS CHANGE. SHOWING GOOD-LOOKING CLOTHES ISN’T ENOUGH ANYMORE. WITH SO MUCH OVERSATURATION OF IMAGERY OF GOOD-LOOKING CLOTHES, I THINK YOU HAVE TO GO FURTHER. I’VE STARTED GETTING PROBABLY MORE ABSTRACT THAN A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ORIGINALLY INTERESTED IN ME, AND I’M SURE THEY WERE APPALLED. BUT YOU CAN’T STAY THE SAME FOREVER, EVEN THOUGH MY VALUES ARE STILL THE SAME. THE WORLD HAS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT, AND IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS, MAYBE YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPELLING. THIS ISN’T REALLY COMPLETELY ABOUT CLOTHES — THIS IS MORE ABOUT AN ETHOS. THIS IS MORE ABOUT A SET OF VALUES THAT I STAND FOR, AND THIS IS ABOUT EXPERIMENTATION, AND THIS IS ABOUT RISK-TAKING, AND THIS IS ABOUT SEARCHING FOR MORE. SVEN SCHUMANN — SO, WHAT KIND OF IMPACT ARE YOU TRYING TO HAVE ON SOCIETY WITH THE CLOTHES YOU ARE DESIGNING? RICK OWENS — I ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE KIND OF A QUIET FLAMBOYANCE, AND I WANTED TO HAVE ROMANTICISM, AND I WANTED TO CHALLENGE AESTHETICS THAT I FELT WERE TOO NARROW AND TOO CONSERVATIVE AND TOO RIGID AND TOO JUDGMENTAL. I WANTED TO BROADEN THOSE PARAMETERS A BIT OR BLUR THEM OR FUCK WITH THEM. I WANTED TO CHALLENGE GOOD TASTE, PERCEPTIONS OF GOOD TASTE, BUT IN A KIND WAY, IN A GENTLE WAY. I WANTED THERE TO BE A GENTLE HUMOR IN PUSHING BOUNDARIES. MAYBE THAT’S A GOOD WAY OF ROUNDING THAT OFF. AND WHEN YOU’RE BLURRING THE EDGES OF CONVENTIONALIST SETTING, I THINK THAT BLEEDS INTO BLURRING THE EDGES OF INTOLERANCE AND BIGOTRY. AND THAT’S WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. SVEN SCHUMANN — HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE STATE OF FASHION TODAY? RICK OWENS — CLOTHES USED TO BE SO MUCH ABOUT COMMUNICATION, BUT THERE’S SO MUCH COMMUNICATION NOW! CLOTHES MIGHT HAVE BECOME A LITTLE BIT IRRELEVANT. MAYBE THAT’S WHY CLOTHES ARE BECOMING KIND OF MORE MARKERS OF IRONY. CLOTHES NOW ARE NOT SO MUCH ABOUT BEAUTY — MAYBE THEY’RE MORE ABOUT DISPLAYING KNOWLEDGE AND DISPLAYING WIT AND DISPLAYING SHREWDNESS. I THINK THERE IS A SHREWDNESS THAT IS EXCITING. I LOVE IT. I NEVER, EVER DISAPPROVE OF EVOLUTION BECAUSE THAT’S SILLY. I DO THINK THERE’S KIND OF A HARDNESS NOW, KIND OF A CALCULATING CRUDENESS THAT I THINK IS REALLY COOL — I THINK IT’S REALLY SOPHISTICATED AND KIND OF ELEGANT. SVEN SCHUMANN — DOES FASHION, IN YOUR OPINION, HAVE A CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY? RICK OWENS — FASHION IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT IRRESPONSIBILITY. FASHION IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT EXPRESSING YOUR INNER DESIRES AND THE THINGS THAT YOU’RE ASHAMED OF. NO, THERE’S NO RESPONSIBILITY.

WELCOME TO THE RICK OWENS WORLD! “I LIKE GRACEFUL SHAPES AND GRACEFUL FORMS, BUT ALSO TO BE AS BARBARIC AND CRUDE AS POSSIBLE,” SAYS THE DESIGNER, WHOSE FIRST LOOK BACK AT HIS OEUVRE, FROM CULT CLOTHING TO CAMEL-LEATHER FOOT STOOLS, IS ON DISPLAY AT LA TRIENNALE DI MILANO. “SUBHUMAN, INHUMAN, SUPERHUMAN” (UNTIL 25TH MARCH 2018) IS THE WARRING TITLE GIVEN TO THE FIRST FULL SHOW OF A DESIGNER WHO CAME FROM AMERICA’S WEST COAST, MOVED TO PARIS IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM AND, WITH HIS CREATIVE WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY, HAS BUILT A POWERFUL, UNNERVING AND SOLID BUSINESS. HIS NEXT MEN’S FASHION SHOW WILL TAKE PLACE IN PARIS ON 18TH JANUARY. AT AGE 56, AND HAVING RECEIVED THE 2017 LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD BY THE CFDA (COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNER OF AMERICA), OWENS DESERVES AN IN-DEPTH MUSEUM STUDY. BUT, IN SPITE OF A STRONG COLLABORATION WITH THE TRIENNALE AND THE ENTHUSIASM OF ELEONORA FIORANI, THE CURATOR OF ITS FASHION DEPARTMENT, THIS COLLECTION OF EXTRAORDINARY PIECES IS REALLY RICK’S OWN SHOW. HE WILL CELEBRATE IT WITH AN ALL-NIGHT PARTY IN MILAN AT THE WEEKEND. OH MY GOODNESS ME. BOY, WAS IT PLANNED OUT!” RICK SAYS. “FIRST OF ALL, IT’S JUST THE MOST IDEAL SPACE. THAT BEAUTIFUL ART DECO CURVE, THOSE HIGH CEILINGS AND THE WINDOWS AT THE TOP WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE TREETOPS… I LOVE IT; IT’S JUST PERFECT. WE BUILT A MODEL OF IT, SCULPTED THE SHAPE AND MOVED AROUND FIGURINES OF THE PILLARS AND PLANTS. IT WAS VERY HANDS-ON AND THROUGHOUT I KEPT TELLING EVERYBODY, ‘THE SCULPTURE ISN’T BIG ENOUGH!’ OR ‘I’M NOT SURE IT WILL WORK IN THE SPACE.’ I TOLD THEM TO ADD EXTRA STUFF TO MAKE IT MORE BRUTAL, MORE BARBARIC AND MORE RAW.” SOME OF THE PIECES DO SEEM RAW, WILD AND ALMOST SHOCKING AS A STATEMENT IN THE WOULD-BE CIVILISED WORLD: A JACKET UNPEELS TO REVEAL UNZIPPED TROUSERS AND THIGH-HIGH, THICK LEATHER BOOTS – NOT TO MENTION HAIR THAT FALLS STRAIGHT BUT WILD, IMPRISONING THE FACE. THE CURATOR POINTS OUT THAT THE MANY EXTRAORDINARY HEADPIECES ARE MADE WITH HUMAN HAIR AND RICK TELLS ME THAT HIS OWN HAIR IS INCLUDED IN THE MENACING COIL ABOVE OUR HEADS. THE STRENGTH OF THIS EXHIBITION IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IN DETAIL CREATIONS THAT I MYSELF SAW PASS BY ON THE RUNWAY, OFTEN IN A GROUP (OR SHALL WE SAY “CULT”) DISPLAY. WHILE THE POWER OF THESE RICK OWENS SHOWS CAN BE APPRECIATED IN THE LOOP OF VIDEOS AT THE END OF THE TRIENNALE EXHIBITION, THE REVOLUTIONARY QUALITY OF HIS WORK IS EXPERIENCED IN CLOSE-UP: SEEING EACH DRAPED DRESS, AS FIORANI EXPLAINS, NOT SLITHERING OVER THE BODY, BUT SUBTLY CHANGING THE FEMALE SHAPE. THE FABRICS THEMSELVES, LISTED IN A BOOKLET OF PROGRAMME NOTES, ARE UNEXPECTED MIXES OF VISCOSE AND LAMBSKIN OR, EVEN FOR THE SILVER STOCKINGS, A COMBINATION OF “ACID LAMBSKIN COWHIDE AND MERINO KNIT”. FIORANI DESCRIBES HOW THESE UNEXPECTED MATERIALS ARE USED, INCLUDING THE KNIVES AND FORKS IN DARK FABRICS AND THE SLEEVE THAT TURNS INTO A MASK. SUCH GESTURES ARE DEFINED BY FIORANI AS “GOTHIC”. I TELL RICK THAT THE PRESENTATION APPEARS TO BE LESS OF A RETROSPECTIVE AND MORE OF A BROAD SWEEP OF HIS WORK, INCLUDING THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED COLOURS HE INTRODUCED OR THE OCCASIONAL DELIBERATE SHOCKS IN THE SHAPING OF MEN’S CLOTHING TO CONCENTRATE ON THE P NIS. “TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT’S INSPIRING TO DO AN EXHIBITION. IT HAS MOTIVATED ME TO HAVE MORE AMBITION AND DRIVE, AND IT’S A LOT OF FUN,” OWENS SAYS, EXPLAINING THAT THE MUSEUM APPROACHED HIM FIRST, AND THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS A PROPERTY IN VENICE, MILAN “IS NOT THE PART OF ITALY I AM BASED IN”. ONE OF THE GREAT STRENGTHS OF THE RICK OWENS STYLE IS THAT IT HAS NO OBVIOUS HOME TERRITORY. INSTEAD, THERE IS A GENERAL SENSE OF RAW ENERGY. HENCE, THE PRESENTATION IS PLAYED OUT IN A COMBINATION OF ULTRA-SOPHISTICATED MATERIALS WITH DEEP DESIGN THOUGHTS. “HE IS RETHINKING THE GRAMMAR OF CLOTHING,” FIORANI SAYS. “HE IS CREATING CURVES WHERE CURVES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE, SO REALLY HE IS RESHAPING THE BODY. ALSO HE IS RESHAPING THE CLASSICAL ELEMENTS. BUT HE ALWAYS STILL KEEPS ONE CLASSICAL AND CENTRAL ELEMENT, WHICH IS USUALLY THE COAT.” THE “DEEPER MEANING” IS ALWAYS AN ELEMENT OF RICK OWENS’ WORLD. BUT WHAT, I ASKED HIM, INSPIRED HIS BOLD AND EVEN MYSTERIOUS TITLE? “SUBHUMAN, INHUMAN, SUPERHUMAN IS THE EQUILIBRIUM THAT WE ARE ALL TRYING TO FIND BETWEEN OUR FAILURES, OUR SUCCESSES, AND WHO WE WANT TO BE,” RICK EXPLAINS. “EVERYTHING THAT I AM DOING IS ABOUT GETTING THROUGH LIFE, FINDING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN AN AMBITION THAT I AM A LITTLE BIT ASHAMED OF AND ALSO THIS DRIVE TO SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE AND MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. THIS IS LIKE AN EMPATHETIC RUMINATION ON ALL OF THE THINGS WE ARE ALL GOING THROUGH.” MORE THAN 8,000 VISITORS HAVE SEEN THE OWENS EXHIBITION SINCE IT OPENED LAST MONTH. WHAT ARE THEY LIKELY TO TAKE AWAY FROM A PRESENTATION THAT IS ARTISTIC BUT NOT “ARTY” IN THE SENSE OF SHOWING CLOTHES THAT ARE UNWEARABLE? WILL THE LOCAL MILANESE DEFINE THE DESIGNER’S WORK AS A FASHION CULT? “YOU ARE CALLED A CULT DESIGNER WHEN YOU ARE POPULAR BUT NEVER REALLY HIT THE PRESTIGE OF THE BIG TIME,” THE DESIGNER SAYS. “THEN THEY CALL YOU ‘CULT’, WHICH IS A FUNNY THING, BUT I’M FINE WITH IT. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY COMMIT THEMSELVES TO IT, AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I PUT OUT THERE. I LIKE THE IDEA OF PICKING A CERTAIN AESTHETIC AND STICKING WITH IT – THAT’S SOMETHING I BELIEVE IN. THAT KIND OF CULT IS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE COLLECTING TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE CERTAIN VALUES, AND FOR ME THAT MEANS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INCLUSIVITY AND KINDNESS, AND A GENTLENESS, I THINK. BUT ONCE ENOUGH PEOPLE COLLECT TOGETHER, THEY CAN CREATE A CLOSING WALL TO OTHER PEOPLE. SO WHAT STARTED OUT AS INCLUSIVE ENDS UP BEING EXCLUSIVE.” CERTAIN AREAS OF CREATION HAVE REACHED A FURTHER AUDIENCE. AFTER A COLLABORATION WITH ADIDAS, OWENS HAS NOW TEAMED UP WITH BIRKENSTOCK, BRINGING A NEW SPIRIT TO THE POWERFUL GERMAN BRAND, BOTH IN HIS DESIGNS AND HIS COLLABORATION ON THE “BIRKENSTOCK BOX”, A MOBILE RETAIL CONCEPT THAT ROLLS INTO CITIES LIKE A SHIPPING CONTAINER ON WHEELS. ITS NEXT STOP IS OUTSIDE THE RICK OWENS STORE IN LOS ANGELES, WHERE IT WILL ENCOMPASS SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE DESIGNER: HIS FASCINATION WITH CULT FOOTWEAR; HIS LONG-TERM INVOLVEMENT IN ARCHITECTURE; AND HIS WIFE’S DESIGN SKILLS THAT HELPED HIM CREATE THE BOX. “I SEE THE SANDALS WORKING VERY WELL,” SAYS RICK. “THEY HAVE AN ALMOST ART DECO-BIBLICAL LOOK, WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS.” IN FLORENCE AT THE PITTI UOMO MENSWEAR SHOWS THE NEXT DAY, I SPOKE TO OLIVER REICHERT, BIRKENSTOCK’S CEO, ABOUT THIS NEW COLLABORATION. “WE ALWAYS HAVE PEOPLE ASKING TO DO COLLABORATIONS,” HE SAYS. “I TELL MY TEAM, ‘A COLLABORATION IS GOOD IF ONE PLUS ONE IS THREE. IF ONE PLUS ONE IS TWO, IT’S NOT A COLLABORATION.” YOU MARRY SOMEBODY IF YOU REALLY ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. IT VERY SELDOM HAPPENS. RICK OWENS IS ONE OF THE DESIGNERS WHO BRINGS IDEAS TO THE TABLE. HIS AWARENESS AND INTELLECTUAL THINKING ABOUT THE BRAND CREATES SOMETHING SPECIAL.” WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MAKERS OF ORTHOPAEDIC SANDALS TURNED FASHIONABLE FOOTWEAR, THERE IS ONE UNCHANGING COLLABORATION IN OWENS’ LIFE: HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MICHÈLE LAMY. I WOULD LIKED TO HAVE TALKED TO HER ABOUT RICK’S EXHIBITION, BUT SHE CURRENTLY HAS HER OWN COMMITMENT AT SELFRIDGES IN LONDON – “LAMYLAND”, WHICH IS OPEN UNTIL MARCH AND FOCUSES ON A BOXING GYM WITH WORKSHOPS AND EVENTS TO INTRODUCE A POWERFUL, BUT STYLISH TAKE ON EMPOWERMENT. IT NOT ONLY INCLUDES THE MOST STYLISH OF DECORATIVE PUNCH BAGS, BUT CONVEYS A GLAMOROUS SPIRIT THAT UNDERSCORES THE DYNAMIC ATTITUDE OF MODERN WOMEN. “SUPPOSING I WERE A PUGILISTIC, MALE OR FEMALE 22-YEAR-OLD FASHION STUDENT WHO DISCOVERED YOUR WORK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE MILAN EXHIBITION, WHAT REACTION WOULD YOU HOPE FOR?” I ASK RICK. “I WANT TO BE FOR THEM THE WAY SALVADOR DALI OR DAVID BOWIE WAS FOR ME,” HE REPLIES. “TO OFFER POSSIBILITIES BEYOND WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT BEFORE. I WANT TO SAY, ‘YOU COULD LEARN SO MANY THINGS. YOU CAN REALLY WORK OUTSIDE THE BOX. IT IS POSSIBLE. YOU DON’T HAVE TO FEEL CONFINED OR OPPRESSED.’” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

OWENS’S APPROACH IS LESS “WHY?” THAN “WHY NOT?”—A QUESTING PROCESS THAT HAS LED HIM TO FUSE NATURE’S FINEST MATERIALS (PAPER-THIN LAMBSKIN, RAW CUT SILKS) AND MANKIND’S MORE MONUMENTAL INCLINATIONS (BE THOSE ARCHITECTURAL, CINEMATIC, MUSICAL, OR OTHERWISE) TO CREATE CLOTHING THAT HAS GENUINELY SHIFTED THE FASHION DIAL FORWARD, BOTH FOR THE SUBCULTURES HE HAS NURTURED AND FOR THE FIELD AT LARGE. THAT SAID, OWENS WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT HIS WORK HAS BEEN PIGEONHOLED. “FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE I’M GOING TO BE THE SNEAKERS-AND-BAGGY-SHORTS GUY IN BLACK,” HE SAYS. “BUT I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR ANYTHING AT ALL, SO BEING ABLE TO ELABORATE ON IT IS JUST ICING ON THE CAKE.” SPEAKING TO ARTNET NEWS FROM HIS LABEL’S PRODUCTION HQ IN CONCORDIA (A SMALL TOWN IN MODENA, ITALY), OWENS IS REFERRING TO “SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN“—HIS FIRST RETROSPECTIVE EXHIBITION, CURRENTLY ON VIEW AT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO, WHICH PROVIDES AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DESIGNER TO “ELABORATE” ON HIS LIFE’S WORK. FROM AFAR, IT SEEMS AN INCONGRUOUS VENUE FOR THE EXPAT PARISIAN’S FIRST FORAY INTO PUBLIC NOSTALGIA, BUT OWENS’S LINKS WITH ITALY ARE MANY, AND THE RARE FREEDOM GRANTED TO HIM BY THE PRESTIGIOUS DESIGN MUSEUM WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUSE. “I AGREED TO IT AS I DIDN’T HAVE ANY INTERACTION WITH OTHER CURATORS AT ALL,” HE SAYS. “THAT WAS THE ONLY APPEAL IN DOING IT. I’M NOT GOOD AT NEGOTIATING, COMPROMISING, AND LISTENING TO OTHER PEOPLE SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING.” BORN FROM THAT CURATORIAL FREEDOM, OWENS’S SHOW IS A SPRAWLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY, OCCUPYING THE TRIENNALE’S CURVED GALLERY WITH TABLEAUX AND TALL PEDESTALS HOLDING MANNEQUINS DRAPED IN HIS CREATIONS—ALL OF IT ARRANGED NOT CHRONOLOGICALLY, BUT CHROMATICALLY. IN SHADES OF BONE WHITE, PEARL GREY, KHAKI, AND STARK BLACK, OUTFITS ARE NUANCED WITH EXQUISITE DETAILS: PROTRUDING FORMS OF COPPER LEATHER, STRICT ROWS OF BUGLE BEADS, GEOMETRIC ARRANGEMENTS OF HORN, STRIPES OF MINK, AND CASCADING JERSEY PLEATS REMINISCENT OF THE WORK OF MADAME GRÈS OR MADELEINE VIONNET. IN VITRINES NEARBY, OWENS TELLS HIS STORY THROUGH AN INTIMATE CURATION OF PERSONAL PARAPHERNALIA, FROM JEWELRY AND INVITATIONS TO PHOTOGRAPHY AND FASHION SHOWS TO MORE EXOTIC PIECES LIKE BONE CUTLERY AND A REUSABLE COCK RING FASHIONED FROM A GOAT’S EYELID (A PRODUCT THAT THE DESIGNER COMMERCIALIZED IN 2008, SOLD IN A TOADSKIN CASE). THOUGH OWENS’S FURNITURE LINE IS PRESENT, IT TAKES A BACKSEAT, WITH HIS COSTLIER CREATIONS IN PETRIFIED WOOD, OX BONE, ANTLER, AND ALABASTER ESCHEWED IN FAVOR OF MORE ROBUST CAMELHAIR MODULES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT. WHAT FOLLOWS IS A CONVERSATION WITH RICK OWENS ABOUT HIS SHOW, AND THE INSPIRATIONS BEHIND IT. WHERE ARE YOU AT THE MOMENT, RICK? I’M ON MY TERRACE IN CONCORDIA. IT’S OVERGROWN WITH JASMINE PLANTS. I DON’T TRIM THEM, SO I LET THEM GO WILD. I HAVE A GRETA GARBO MOVIE PLAYING AND I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH MICHELE [LAMY] WHO IS IN LONDON FOR HER LAMYLAND BOXING WORLD PROJECT. MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU LIVE FULL TIME IN PARIS, BUT IN FACT YOU ARE OFTEN IN VENICE, OR CONCORDIA, RIGHT? I SPEND ABOUT FIVE MONTHS A YEAR IN VENICE NOW, FROM ABOUT MAY TO SEPTEMBER SO I DON’T NEED TO GO THERE IN WINTER. BESIDES, THE DOCK IS CLOSED TO THE EXCELSIOR, WHICH IS WHERE I ORDER ALL MY FOOD! SO, SHOWING YOUR FIRST RETROSPECTIVE IN ITALY WASN’T SUCH A LEFT-FIELD MOVE AFTER ALL. THE WHOLE THING OF HAVING THAT SHOW IN MILAN JUST SEEMED VERY RESOLVED—IT MADE PERFECT SENSE TO ME. THIS BRAND IS ITALIAN, IN THE END, ALTHOUGH I’M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH MILAN, AS I HAVEN’T DONE A LOT OF BUSINESS THERE. WE HAVE A STORE THERE, BUT I’VE ALWAYS SHOWN IN PARIS. I LOVE THE WAY MILAN LOOKS, THOUGH: THE SEVERITY, THE SHAGGINESS. THEY HAVE A SHAGGY WAY THE PLANTS DRIP OFF THE BALCONIES. PARIS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE GROOMED. WITH ALL THAT STONE AND ALL THAT GRAYNESS AND THE SEVERITY, IT IS KIND OF STERN. I COULD TOTALLY LIVE IN MILAN. FOR ME THE TRAIN STATION REALLY SETS THE TONE FOR THE CITY. FOR THE PARTY WE HAD, WE WERE LOOKING AT SPACES IN THE TRAIN STATION, BUT IN THE END, THERE WERE TOO MANY ISSUES WITH THE ENTRANCES. DID YOU COME TO THE PARTY? YES, I THINK I SAW YOU BACKSTAGE WITH THOSE WHITE-PAINTED FAN DANCERS, JUST AS THEY TOOK THEIR UNDERWEAR OFF TO PERFORM. (LAUGHS) WELL, ORIGINALLY, I WANTED TO FIND ORIGINAL LEATHER-DADDY FAN DANCERS FROM SAN FRANCISCO, BUT NOW THOSE GUYS DO THIS NEW FLAG DANCING THAT JUST WASN’T OLD-SCHOOL ENOUGH. AND I WANTED THEM TO BE NAKED BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETE HEDONISM, TO HONOR THE QUEER FOREFATHERS THAT SUFFERED A LOT. I THOUGHT, “THIS IS A FASHION PARTY IN MILAN, IT HAS TO BE FULL-ON!” THEY WERE PRETTY GREAT, BUT THEY HAD TO LEARN FAN DANCING. IT CAN BE VERY INTRICATE! AND THEY HAD BEARDS! GUYS HAVE BEARDS THESE DAYS. SO WE EXTENDED THEM! DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO ITALIAN DESIGN? IT’S FUNNY TO CONSIDER THAT THERE’S AN ETTORE SOTTSASS SHOW AT THE TRIENNALE COINCIDING WITH YOURS. I LIKED LUIGI COLANI AT THE TIME OF SOTTSASS—HE’S THE ONE I IDENTIFY WITH THE MOST IN ITALIAN DESIGN. I REALLY LOVE HIS WORK. HE REMINDS ME OF THAT ’70S BRUTALIST MOMENT WITH DOMUS MAGAZINE AT THAT TIME. I THINK I FIRST SAW THAT MAGAZINE WHEN I WAS AT ART SCHOOL IN LA. AND I ALWAYS LIKED THE OLD STUFF LIKE CARLO SCARPA, AND LUIGI MORETTI ESPECIALLY. HOW DID IT FEEL TO CURATE YOUR OWN RETROSPECTIVE? TO SEE THIS KIND OF SHOW FOR A LIVING ARTIST OR DESIGNER, AND FROM THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE, IS RARE. OBVIOUSLY, IT MAKES YOU AWARE OF YOUR MORTALITY AND IT PRESSES SOME BUTTONS THERE ABOUT WHAT YOU’VE ACHIEVED, AND IT’S EASY TO GET A LITTLE BIT MELANCHOLY. BUT THAT FEELS A LITTLE SILLY, SO I PREFERRED TO COMPLETELY RELISH IT AND WALLOW IN IT. YOU DO THINK ABOUT THE MEANING OF YOUR LIFE AND WHAT YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR AND ALL OF THAT. IT’S REALLY VERY SATISFYING. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS BEING ABLE TO TELL THE STORY ON MY OWN TERMS, INSTEAD OF HAVING IT BEING INTERPRETED BY SOMEONE ELSE, WHICH WOULD NEVER BE PERFECT. BEING ABLE TO TELL YOUR OWN STORY IS AN AMAZING THING. IT DOESN’T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, TO BE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT YOUR STRENGTHS AND DISCRETELY SWEEP AWAY YOUR MISTAKES. IT WAS A WEIRD YEAR AS I ALSO RECEIVED THE CFDA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER, BUT THEY’RE SUCH STRONG MOMENTS OF LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT THAT IT WAS SUCH A WEIRD COINCIDENCE. I’M 56, WHICH ISN’T REALLY THAT OLD AND IT WAS REALLY VALIDATING AND SATISFYING. I’M NOT GOING TO SNEER AT THE FACT THAT I AM BEING RECOGNIZED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT. AS YOU BECOME OLDER, YOU BECOME THE ESTABLISHMENT. IT’S INTERESTING TO BE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THIS GENERATION’S AESTHETIC ELITE. IN TERMS OF THE GARMENTS ON DISPLAY, I WAS WONDERING WHY THE OLDEST PIECES OF THE SHOW ONLY DATE BACK TO 2005–06? WAS THERE A PRAGMATIC CONSTRAINT THERE, IN REGARD TO YOUR ARCHIVES? YES. LITERALLY IT WAS BECAUSE I DIDN’T HAVE ANY ARCHIVES! ORIGINALLY, MY LABEL WAS A LICENSE, SO THE SAMPLES TECHNICALLY WEREN’T EVEN MINE, SO THEY GOT SOLD OR DISAPPEARED. THE ARCHIVES WEREN’T IN MY HEAD. I DIDN’T THINK I WAS THAT KIND OF DESIGNER. I WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED TO SAVE THINGS FOR ARCHIVES IN THE BEGINNING. SO THINGS LITERALLY DISAPPEARED—EVEN WHAT MICHELE HAD. MICHELE GIVES THINGS AWAY WHEN SHE GETS TIRED OF THEM. SHE GIVES SOMETHING TO HER DAUGHTER, THEN IT GOES TO SOMEONE ELSE. I THINK IF I EVER DO ANOTHER SHOW MAYBE I WOULD DO ONE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE DISCREET AND MORE RESTRAINED AND MORE ABOUT CRAFT AND TECHNIQUE AND CUT AND THE DETAILS. THIS ONE WAS MORE THEATRICAL AND BIG, AND IF I EVER DID A SHOW THAT WAS MORE RESTRAINED, THEN IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO HUNT DOWN THINGS THAT LOOKED REALLY LOVED, AND REALLY USED. THE SHOW’S SET DESIGN IS A BIG PART OF THAT THEATRICALITY. YOU’VE SAID IT’S A RESPONSE TO YOUR OWN WORDS: “I WOULD LAY A BLACK GLITTERING TURD ON THE WHITE LANDSCAPE OF CONFORMITY.” GUY TREBAY WROTE SOMETHING IN THE TIMES A FEW YEARS AGO, WELL BEFORE THE TRIENNALE APPROACHED ME FOR THE RETROSPECTIVE. HE WROTE ABOUT MY WORK, AND HE BROUGHT UP THAT THING THAT I HAD SAID OVER 20 YEARS AGO SO, SO I GUESS IT WAS IN MY MIND. AND THE SPACE ITSELF WAS ARCHITECTURALLY RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. IT SEEMED THAT PLACING A HUGE, PRIMAL, SWEEPING GESTURE IN THERE WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. MICHELE THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY LAME, SHE TURNED HER NOSE UP AT IT AND SAID IT WAS “FIRST DEGREE.” I DID IT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE THINGS I HAVE DONE ARE SIMPLE GESTURES AND I LIKE THAT. IT WAS A FLOURISH THAT MADE SENSE WITH MY LOVE OF LAND ART AND OF SOMETHING PRIMITIVE IN THIS GRACEFUL CURVE. I REFERRED TO IT AS A “PRIMAL HOWL.” THE WORKING TITLE WAS THE “TURDNADO.” IT GETS CHEAP AND IT GETS COMICAL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE COMPOSITION OF THE “PRIMAL HOWL” PIECE? I BELIEVE IT’S MADE FROM YOUR OWN HAIR, SAND FROM THE ADRIATIC SEA, ET CETERA. IT COULDN’T JUST BE FOAM. IT HAD TO MEAN SOMETHING THAT RELATED TO MY LIFE AND THAT FELT PERSONAL. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT I HAD BEEN SAVING UP WADS OF MY HAIR OVER THE YEARS. I REALLY HAD WADS OF IT FROM HAIRBRUSHES. OF COURSE, THERE IS NOT A HAIR IN EVERY SQUARE INCH OF IT BUT IT IS IN THE MIX. IT’S ABOUT F CKING THE SPACE WITH YOUR DNA! THE SAND IS FROM THE AREA AROUND VENICE. IT’S THE BEACH THAT I AM ON QUITE A LOT, AND THE SEASIDE. I WOULD BE AT THE SEASIDE ALL YEAR LONG IF I COULD. THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT INTERSECTION OF OCEAN AND SEA AND EARTH AND SKY THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. WHAT DID YOU WANT THIS SHOW TO SAY, IF NOT TO BE A DIDACTIC A–Z GUIDE TO RICK OWENS? THERE WAS NO REAL NARRATIVE. IT IS ABOUT AS GRACEFUL A COMPOSITION AS I CAN FIND. IT’S BASED ON INSTINCT. IT WAS JUST ABOUT SCRAPING TOGETHER EVERYTHING THAT I FELT RIGHT ABOUT, AND CREATING THESE GRACEFUL COMPOSITIONS. I GUESS I HAD ABOUT 30 PERCENT MORE THAT I EDITED OUT. IT’S LIKE POETRY—YOU TRY TO COMBINE SOME SENTENCES AND SOME WORDS THAT REFLECT OFF OF EACH OTHER IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY.

SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN” AT LA TRIENNALE DI MILANO — MARCH 2018 — BY RICCARDO CONTI WITH THE EXHIBITION, SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN, PRESENTED BY TRIENNALE DI MILANO, CALIFORNIAN FASHION DESIGNER RICK OWENS SHOWS HIS TWENTY-YEAR CAREER IN A LARGE RETROSPECTIVE THAT COVERS CLOTHES, ACCESSORIES, FURNITURE, AND PUBLICATIONS CHOSEN BY THE DESIGNER HIMSELF. THE EXHIBITION OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIVE INTO THE POETICS DEFINED BY OWENS, STARTING FROM HIS FIRST COLLECTION PRESENTED IN LOS ANGELES IN 1994 UP TO THE PRESENT, WHICH TELLS OF ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DESIGNERS OF OUR TIME. IN ADDITION TO HIS ROLE IN FASHION, WHICH WAS RECENTLY CELEBRATED WITH THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD BY THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA IN 2017, RICK OWENS IS AMONG THE MOST RADICAL AND ACCLAIMED AUTHORS—EVEN BEYOND THE COMMON DEFINITION OF FASHION DESIGNER—DUE HIS PERSISTENT, INNOVATIVE, AND CHALLENGING WORK WITH FORMS AND MATERIALS. HIS WORK BECAME FAMOUS NOT ONLY FOR THE QUALITIES OF HIS CLOTHES BUT ALSO FOR THE STORYTELLING BUILT AROUND THEM, USING TRANSVERSAL LANGUAGES AND EXPRESSIVE FORMS TO EMBODY A PERSONAL AND COURAGEOUS VISION THAT HAS ANTICIPATED MANY OF MOST DEBATED THEMES IN FASHION NOWADAYS, SUCH AS GENDER FLUIDITY, OVERSIZING, AND BRUTAL CHIC AESTHETICS. WITH HIS MEMORABLE FASHION SHOWS, RICK OWENS HAS ALSO IMPOSED AN IDEA OF BODY AND BEAUTY VERY FAR FROM THE STATIC AND CONSERVATIVE IDEALS PORTRAYED ON CATWALKS AND FASHION MAGAZINES, EXPANDING THE IDEA OF HUMANITY TO UNPREDICTABLE AND SOMETIMES OUTRAGEOUS VISIONS, AS THE TITLE OF THE EXHIBITION SUGGESTS. “I WANTED TO TAKE WHAT A DISMISSIVE WORLD MIGHT MOCK AND CREATE SOMETHING FINE, EMPATHETIC, KIND, AND INCLUSIVE,” SAYS OWENS, REFERRING TO HIS WORK AND ALSO ANTICIPATING TWO OF HIS GREAT TRAITS: MENTAL FREEDOM AND INNOVATION. IN THIS CONVERSATION, WE TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT THESE ISSUES, TRYING TO DEEPEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ART AND DESIGN, BODY, AND RITUALS… RICCARDO CONTI: IN RECENT INTERVIEWS, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR AESTHETICS AS “ARTIFICE AS FORMALIZED RITUAL,” REFERRING ALSO TO KABUKI THEATER, IKEBANA, AND TEA CEREMONY. HOW DID YOU GET INTO ZEN CULTURE? RICK OWENS: I’M NOT REALLY AN EXPERT ON ZEN PHILOSOPHY, BUT IT’S CERTAINLY SOMETHING I’VE STARTED TO APPRECIATE SINCE I WAS YOUNG. AT HOME, MY FATHER HAD A LARGE LIBRARY FULL OF BOOKS ON THESE SUBJECTS; EVEN IF I COULD NOT DISCUSS PHILOSOPHY WITH MY FATHER, THOSE IMAGES BECAME PART OF MY REFERENCES. RC: CAN YOU EXPAND A BIT ON THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTIFICE, EXCESS, AND RITUAL? IN SEXUAL PRACTICES EVEN… RO: I AM VERY FASCINATED BY THE CONTRASTS THAT ARE CREATED IN SOME PRACTICES APPARENTLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. THIS KIND OF SUSPENDED TIME, WITH A WEIRD COMBINATION BETWEEN MENACE AND VULNERABILITY, NEED AND HUNGER, AND KINDNESS… THAT PART OF SOME CULTURES. IN GENERAL, EVERY KIND OF EXTREME BEHAVIOR INTERESTS ME; EVERY WAY OF THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX INTERESTS ME. YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU DIE, DON’T YOU WANT TO TRY EVERYTHING? DON’T YOU WANT TO GO AS FAR AS YOU CAN? THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO EXPERIENCE, AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS THIS FALSE MORALITY THAT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. RC: MANY OF YOUR CREATIONS SEEM TO ALLUDE TO CLOTHING ITEMS INSPIRED BY S&amp;M PRACTICES, SUCH AS STRAPS, RESTRAINTS, AND THE USE OF SOME MATERIALS. WHAT DOES THAT IMAGINARY MEAN TO YOU? RO: INITIALLY, I WASN’T PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN SUBMISSION OR DOMINATION, BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE RITUAL ASPECT OF IT. I APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF TAKING SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE, LIKE SEX, AND TURNING THAT IN A PERFORMANCE OR A THEATRICAL RITUAL. IT’S THE SAME REASON WHY I LOVE THE TEA CEREMONY: TAKING A VERY SIMPLE PLEASURE AND ELEVATING IT IN A RITUALIZED FORM. I AM INTERESTED IN THE IMPLICIT SIMPLICITY OF SATISFYING A SIMPLE PLEASURE, OF HAVING SEX OR DRINKING A CUP OF TEA WITH OTHER PEOPLE… OBVIOUSLY, HOWEVER, TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING SO SIMPLE, THE PROCESS CAN BE EXTREMELY DENSE AND ARTIFICIAL. RC: I AM INTERESTED IN THIS CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF EXPANDING CONCEPTS: YOU CONSIDER SIMPLE ELEMENTS AND TAKE THEM TO ANOTHER LEVEL OF EXCESS, NOT AS A CARICATURE, BUT GIVING THEM NEW LIFE AND MEANING. HOW DO YOU APPLY THIS APPROACH TO CREATING CLOTHES? RO: I WANT TO EXTEND BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE WEARING; A LOT OF TIME, MY CLOTHES HAVE THINGS THAT ARE EXTENDED OR THINGS THAT ARE DRAGGING. I THINK THERE IS A SUBTLE MESSAGE IN THIS PRACTICE: WHY KEEP YOURSELF WITHIN THE SAME LIMITS OF THE CLOTHES THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES? YOU CAN GO FURTHER. RC: THERE IS ALWAYS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ONE’S OWN BODY AND THAT OF OTHERS’ THAT SEEMS TO ME TO GOES BEYOND SIMPLE DRESSING… RO: IT’S WHAT I DO, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH MY T-SHIRTS, WHICH ARE ALWAYS LONGER THAN NORMAL ONES. I DO IT BECAUSE I WANT MORE FABRIC, BECAUSE I WANT GENEROSITY. THIS EXTENSION SYMBOLIZES GOING BEYOND THE RULES; IT’S A DECLARATION TO OTHER PEOPLE. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO BE, THIS IS WHAT I’M TRAINING TO BECOME, AND THIS IS MY AMBITION. I THINK THAT CLOTHES ARE ONE OF THE FIRST CODES TO AFFIRM WHAT ONE WANTS TO BE—AND WHO YOU INTEND TO BE—AND IT IS A POWERFUL AND PROFOUND THING. RC: THE LANGUAGE OF THE BODIES YOU IMAGINE AND SELECT IS FUNDAMENTAL IN YOUR POETICS. HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THEM? WHAT MEANING DO THEY HAVE FOR YOU? RO: FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THAT THE USE I MAKE OF BODIES IN CATWALKS IS TO SHOW BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR AND BEAUTIFUL EMOTIONS. ALSO, IN THIS CASE, I WANT TO TRY TO GO BEYOND THE LIMITS OF WHAT ONE ALREADY EXPECTS TO SEE AND KNOWS ABOUT BODIES, GOING BEYOND WHAT ONE BELIEVES TO BE ABLE TO USE TO EXPRESS ONE’S SELF. AS A DESIGNER, I CREATE CLOTHES THAT MODIFY SOMETHING IN THE BODY OF THE WEARER, WHICH EXAGGERATES SOME THINGS AND MINIMIZES OTHER EXISTING ONES. IF I WENT FURTHER THAN THIS, I WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE REAL BODY ITSELF, AND THAT’S WHAT I DID WITH MYSELF. RC: SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE REAL GOAL IS TO MODIFY THE BODIES MORE THAN TO CREATE CLOTHES? RO: AS FOR MYSELF, I HAVE NEVER CHANGED MY CLOTHES. I HAVE ALWAYS WORN A UNIFORM BECAUSE WHAT I DID WAS CHANGE MY OWN BODY INSTEAD; THAT IS MUCH MORE HARDCORE THAN CHANGING AN OUTFIT. I DO NOT DISAPPROVE OF CHANGING CLOTHES BECAUSE BASICALLY IT IS MY JOB—AND I PROMOTE IT—BUT FOR ME, PERSONALLY, THE GOAL IS ALWAYS TO GO BEYOND CLOTHES. WHAT I REALIZE DURING MY FASHION SHOWS IS TO EXPLORE OTHER PHYSICAL EXPRESSIONS, RATHER THAN HAVING WOMEN WHO WEAR TIGHT DRESSES ON VERY HIGH HEELS… RC: YOUR FASHION SHOWS ARE INDEED ALWAYS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED EVENTS BY YOUR AUDIENCE BECAUSE EVERY TIME IT IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE. WAS IT A CHALLENGE TO RECREATE THAT EMOTION IN A MUSEUM DISPLAY LIKE THE EXHIBITION AT THE TRIENNALE? RO:I DON’T KNOW IF I REALLY FELT THIS KIND OF CHALLENGE. MUSEUMS FOR ME ARE LIKE CHURCHES, ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE I FEEL I HAVE TO GO TO ON THIS PLANET. I DIDN’T HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS EXHIBITION, IN THE SENSE THAT THE MUSEUM IS FOR ME AN AESTHETIC MOMENT WHERE YOU GO TO ADMIRE THE RELICS. AND THAT’S OKAY: CONTEMPLATING THE RELICS IS A WAY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH A MOMENT. I DIDN’T HAVE THE FEELING OF HAVING TO RECREATE THE EXPERIENCE AT THE ORIGIN BECAUSE, FOR THAT MOMENT, THERE ARE THE FASHION SHOWS. THE ESSENCE OF A FASHION SHOW IS TO CREATE A UNIQUE MOMENT THAT CANNOT BE REPLICATED—YOU HAVE TO BE THERE AT THAT MOMENT. YOU CAN SEE SOME PHOTOS OR VIDEOS, AS OFTEN HAPPENS TODAY, BUT THAT IS PHYSICALLY CHANGING THE PERCEPTION OF THE LIVED EXPERIENCE. RC: ABOUT THIS: TODAY, THE ROLE OF FASHION SHOWS IS INCREASINGLY UNCERTAIN AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION FOR A BRAND FOR VARIOUS REASONS, ABOVE ALL ECONOMIC, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE FASHION AUDIENCE HAS CHANGED. WHAT VALUE DO THESE MOMENTS HOLD FOR YOU? RO: MANY OF THESE FASHION SHOWS ARE VERY STANDARD, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THAT FASHION SHOWS IN SOME CASES CAN REPRESENT VERY STRONG MOMENTS OF PARTICIPATION, COMMUNION, AND CELEBRATION OF BEAUTY THAT, FOR ME, HAS A PROFOUND VALUE. AND AS I SAID BEFORE, THOSE MOMENTS HAPPEN ONLY IN A CERTAIN MOMENT THAT THEN CANNOT BE RECREATED ANYMORE. THEN THERE IS AN ELEMENT THAT MAKES THEM EVEN MORE COMPELLING: THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER KNOW HOW THEY WILL REALLY GO. IN A VIDEO OR IN A PHOTO SHOOT, YOU CAN CONTROL ALL THE ELEMENTS, BUT WITH THE FASHION SHOWS, THERE IS ALWAYS THIS ELEMENT OF RISK. I DO NOT MEAN OF ACCIDENTS OR DANGERS, I MEAN OF VERY SMALL THINGS THAT CAN BE GESTURES OR EXPRESSIONS THAT YOU CANNOT COMPLETELY CONTROL. FOR THIS REASON, I THINK THEY ARE STILL A GREAT WAY TO COMMUNICATE AND BE TOGETHER. RC: STILL TALKING ABOUT EXHIBITIONS AND FASHION: WAS THERE AN EXHIBITION DEDICATED TO FASHION THAT PARTICULARLY STRUCK YOU AS A PROJECT AND AS AN EXPERIENCE? RO: WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, I REALLY ENJOYED THE EXHIBITION DEDICATED TO MARIANO FORTUNY AND CURATED BY OLIVER SAILLARD AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA IN PARIS (FORTUNY: UN ESPAGNOL À VENISE). THE EXHIBITIONS CREATED BY SAILLARD ARE ALWAYS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ONLY AESTHETIC AND ARE NOT ONLY ACADEMIC, EVEN IF THEY ARE ALWAYS IMPECCABLE FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW. IT HAS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF ALWAYS MAKING FASHION CULTURE, SHOWING HOW MUCH FASHION CAN BE RELEVANT FOR EVERYONE, AND YOU CAN ACHIEVE THAT WHEN A SHOW IS AS BEAUTIFULLY DOCUMENTED, RESEARCHED, AND EDITED AS THAT ONE WAS. RC: IS THERE ANOTHER ART EXHIBITION THAT HAS PARTICULARLY INFLUENCED YOU RECENTLY? RO: I SAW AN IMPRESSIVE MODIGLIANI SHOW AT THE JEWISH MUSEUM IN NEW YORK (MODIGLIANI UNMASKED) OVER CHRISTMAS: THERE WAS A WHOLE ROOM WITH ONLY HEADS, AND THAT ROOM IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS I HAVE SEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME, TOGETHER WITH THE JOSEPH BEUYS SHOW AT THE TATE. RC: IT IS INTERESTING, THIS PAIR OF ARTISTS THAT YOU MENTIONED, BECAUSE IN BOTH CASES THERE ARE ELEMENTS THAT ALSO ARE PRESENT IN YOUR POETICS: EXAGGERATION OF THE ANATOMY AND USE OF YOUR OWN BODY. BY THE WAY, IT WAS FUN TO SEE YOUR ALLEN JONES-STYLE DOPPELGÄNGERS IN YOUR FLAGSHIP STORES; WHERE’D YOU COME UP WITH THAT IDEA? RO: I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST FUNNY AND WEIRD AND DISTURBING—THAT’S WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT, A KIND OF NOVELTY BECAUSE THE APPROACH BEHIND MY FURNITURE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. RC: THERE ARE SEVERAL EXAMPLES AT THE SHOW IN TRIENNALE USING PARTICULAR MATERIALS. RO: YES, I DID A LOT OF PIECES USING SEVERAL MATERIALS LIKE ALABASTER, COW FUR, CONCRETE. THE FIRST OBSERVATION OF MOST PEOPLE IS THAT THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE. WELL, THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT! THERE IS ENOUGH FURNITURE IN THE WORLD THAT I DO NOT DESIGN FURNITURE TO BE COMFORTABLE. I REJECT THIS VISION OF THE WORLD TOTALLY ORIENTED TO PERSONAL COMFORT… THROUGH FURNITURE DESIGN, I SUGGEST SOMETHING MORE DISCIPLINED, MORE FORMAL. RC: SO YOUR FURNITURE PIECES, IN CONTRARY TO YOUR CLOTHES, SUGGEST A HARSHER VIEW OF REALITY? RO: WE LIVE IN THE AGE OF GREATER ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND ALL ANSWERS, WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE CONFUSE WHAT COMFORT IS WITH HAVING EVERYTHING AND THEIR DESIRES IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT LIFE IS ABOUT CARE—AND IT’S NOT EASY—AND PEOPLE THINK THEY DESERVE THE BEST, BUT I THINK THAT NOBODY DESERVES THE BEST… IF YOU’RE GETTING THE BEST, YOU ARE LUCKY! SO IN A WAY, MY FURNITURE IS EXPRESSING ANOTHER WAY TO LIVE, LESS SPONTANEOUS AND MORE STYLIZED. RC: THE BENCHES AND OTHER FURNITURE IN THE TRIENNALE EXHIBITION SEEM COMFORTABLE TO ME… EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT LIE ON IT! RO: BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE! WITH UNCOMFORTABLE, I MEAN THAT FOR THE MATERIALS—THEIR PROPORTIONS AND THEIR WEIGHT. THEY’RE NOT MADE FOR PEOPLE WHO MOVE OFTEN BUT FOR STABLE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHO THEY ARE; I DID NOT CONCEIVE THEM FOR STUDENTS, BUT FOR ADULTS. RC: WHAT ABOUT THAT SUSPENDED GIANT SCULPTURE IN THE CURVED SPACE OF YOUR EXHIBITION? RO: I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN LAND ART AND ARTISTS LIKE MICHAEL HEIZER, AND I WANTED FOR THE SHOW SOMETHING THAT COMMUNICATED AN IDEA OF SHAPELESS PRIMORDIALITY AND ETERNITY THAT CREATED A CONTRAST WITH THE BEAUTY OF CLOTHES. RC: THAT SENSE OF GIGANTISM CONVEYED BY IT IS AGAIN A SIGN OF YOUR AESTHETICS OF EXAGGERATION? RO: YES, IT WAS A VERY LONG PROCESS TO HAVE IT IN THAT WAY; IT TOOK A LOT OF PUSHING TO GET IT BIGGER, BIGGER, AND BIGGER! RC: WHAT WERE YOUR REFERENCES WHEN YOU STARTED DESIGNING FURNITURE? DO YOU HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH ITALIAN DESIGN? RO: IN MY HOUSE IN ITALY, I HAVE ARMCHAIRS BY GIACOMO BALLA AND OTHER OBJECTS FROM THE FUTURIST PERIOD, SUCH AS THE CONTINUOS PROFILE OF MUSSOLINI BY RENATO BERTELLI. I’M INTERESTED IN THE DYNAMISM EXPRESSED BY THOSE ARTISTS. MY FAVORITE ARCHITECT IS LUIGI MORETTI, AND I ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF LUIGI COLANI’S WORK. RC: AS YOU SAID BEFORE, IF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN HAS BEEN REDUCED TO CREATING “NICE” AND COMFORTABLE OBJECTS FOR EVERYONE, FASHION IN RECENT YEARS IS MAINLY SUPPORTED BY THE SALES OF BAGS AND SNEAKER. ABOUT THE LATTER: YOU HAVE BEEN AN ANTICIPATOR OF THIS SNEAKER CULTURE; HOW DID YOU START? RO: WELL, SNEAKERS HAVE BECOME THE CORSAGE OF OUR GENERATION. BEFORE, WOMEN PUT ON BEAUTIFUL CORSAGES AND THE PREVIOUS GENERATION WOULD WEAR HATS THAT WERE EXAGGERATED AND EXTREME. I THINK SNEAKERS HAVE BECOME THAT ELEMENT OF CLOTHING IN WHICH ONE CAN ELABORATE AS MUCH AS HE WANTS IN A VERY CONTROLLED PART OF HIS FIGURE; IT’S A WAY OF SELF-EXPRESSION THAT CHANGES EVERY GENERATION THROUGH DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF CLOTHING. I THINK IT’S SIMPLY THIS. MY PART IN THIS IS KIND OF ODD BECAUSE I ENTERED THE WHOLE SNEAKERS THING AS A KIND OF PARODY: I THOUGHT THAT SNEAKERS WERE THE CLEAREST EXAMPLE OF CONVENTIONALITY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS WEARING THEM TO GO TO THE GYM, SO I WANTED TO EXAGGERATE THEM. THE ORIGINAL ONES WERE OVERSIZED… THEY WERE BOMBASTIC! I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED ANYBODY TO WEAR THEM, BUT THE RESPONSE WAS KIND OF IRONIC. RC: WHAT METHOD IS BEHIND YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS, AND HOW DO YOU INNOVATE THIS LANGUAGE EVERY TIME? RO:BASED ON MY ROUTINE; THERE IS OBVIOUSLY PRELIMINARY RESEARCH AND SOME EVALUATIONS ON THE COLLECTIONS THAT I HAVE JUST FINISHED, BUT I STILL DON’T HAVE A “FORMULA.” YOU KNOW, TWO WEEKS AGO, I WAS WORKING ON THE PRE-COLLECTION, AND I WAS THINKING, “I SHOULD HAVE THIS FIGURED OUT. I SHOULD KNOW WHAT’S COMING NEXT,” BUT I WAS IRRITATED. I STARTED TO THINK THAT I SHOULD BE BETTER RIGHT NOW. I SHOULD BE MORE ADULT, SOPHISTICATED, SELF-AWARE—BUT ONCE AGAIN, I WAS NOT CAPABLE OF VISUALIZING THIS WOMENSWEAR COLLECTION, AND THAT STRESSED ME OUT! I WAS KIND SHOCKED: AFTER ALL THIS TIME, YOU KNOW, LATER IN LIFE, YOU SHOULD REACH A LEVEL OF SERENITY, OF IMPERTURBABILITY THAT CAN’T BE SHAKEN. WELL, I WAS SHAKEN; I WAS UNSTABLE TWO WEEKS AGO, AND THAT PISSED ME OFF—HOW CAN I BE SO STUPID!? (LAUGHS) RC: YOU STILL HAVE A TEENAGED BEHAVIOR! RO: IT’S STILL LIKE THAT, IT’S STILL LIKE THAT! (LAUGHS) BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK I’VE LEARNED IS TO FORGIVE YOURSELF AND LET IT GO, BECAUSE TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE NO FAULTS IS LAUGHABLE. THEREFORE, I’M PUNISHING MYSELF AND FORGIVING MYSELF AT THE SAME TIME!

WE HAVE SHAME, WE HAVE PRIDE, WE HAVE SELF DELUSION.” — MARCH 2018 — BY DELPHINE ROCHE “FASHION IS A FLEETING THING, MADE OF EXTRAVAGANCE, FANCY, AND EMOTION,” STATED DIANA VREELAND. THIS SAME UNCONVENTIONAL SPIRIT HAS DRIVEN AMERICAN RICK OWENS SINCE THE START OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. TODAY, HIS WORLD OF CONTRAST IS BEING HONORED IN MILAN FOR HIS FIRST MUSEUM EXHIBITION, DEMONSTRATING THE SCOPE OF THIS UNUSUAL CREATIVE PERSONALITY. EMOTION AND FANCY ALSO PENETRATE THE MUSIC OF THE IBEYI SISTERS, WHO MIX ELECTRONIC MUSIC WITH THE SOUNDS OF CUBA, JAZZ, AND SOUL TO CARRY THEIR VIBRANT PERSONALITIES BEYOND BORDERS. AS FOR MARTIN MARGIELA, HIS UNIQUE, PIONEERING, AND TRANSGRESSIVE SPIRIT HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE HISTORY OF FASHION. THE PALAIS GALLIERA HONORS HIS GENIUS IN AN UPCOMING RETROSPECTIVE. IN THIS ISSUE CELEBRATING FASHION, THE MIX OF STYLES REVEALS ITS MANY FACETS UNDER THE LENS OF FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPHER JEAN-BAPTISTE MONDINO. CONTEMPORARY AND FANCIFUL, HAUTE COUTURE IS REVEALED UNDERNEATH THE FINERY OF A NEO COUTURE TO EMBRACE WITHOUT RESTRAINT AND EXPRESS ITS OWN EMOTIONS. A HARD-HITTING AND UNCONVENTIONAL DESIGNER, RICK OWENS HAS BEEN MIXING SOPHISTICATED AESTHETICS AND PUNK RAGE, MINIMALISM AND FLAMBOYANCE, IN EVERY CREATIVE FIELD FROM FASHION TO FURNITURE SINCE 1994. HIS CULT OF CHAOS IS NOW TAKING OVER THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO, WHICH IS HONORING HIM WITH THE VERY FIRST MAJOR RETROSPECTIVE OF HIS CAREER. MEET HIM BELOW. NUMÉRO: HOW DID THIS EXHIBITION COME ABOUT? RICK OWENS: IT’S NOT LIKE I APPROACHED ANYBODY... THE TRIENNALE PEOPLE JUST CALLED OUT OF THE BLUE. AND SINCE MY GROUP IS ITALIAN AND MY FACTORIES ARE IN ITALY, IT SEEMED PERFECTLY LOGICAL TO DO SOMETHING IN MILAN. MILAN IS ONE OF THE CAPITALS OF FASHION, SO I FELT RATHER FLATTERED BY THIS PROPOSAL AND RESPONDED WITH ENTHUSIASM. IT’S NOT EVERY DAY I GET ASKED TO DO A RETROSPECTIVE! I WAS ESPECIALLY HAPPY THAT I WAS ALLOWED TO DESIGN THIS EXHIBITION. BECAUSE IT’S ALMOST AN OBITUARY... AFTER ALL, I ALWAYS TEND TO LOOK AT THE THINGS ON THE DARK SIDE. BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS: DETERMINING HOW YOU WANT TO BE SEEN FOR ETERNITY. SO IT’S BETTER TO BE ABLE TO DO IT YOURSELF THAN TO LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT. LETTING SOMEONE ELSE INTERPRET MY WORK WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY. I CAN’T THINK OF ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET I WOULD TRUST WITH THIS ROLE. WELL, MICHÈLE [LAMY, THE DESIGNER’S WIFE] WOULD DO IT VERY WELL, OBVIOUSLY. BUT IT’S FABULOUS TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL HOW YOU PRESENT YOURSELF TO THE WORLD. SO I WAS VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT THIS PROJECT, DESPITE THIS “FINALITY” ASPECT THAT ACCOMPANIES IT. IT COULD BE DISTURBING IF I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE DISTURBED, BUT THAT WOULD BE TOO INDULGENT. THERE’S UNDENIABLY A MELANCHOLIC SIDE TO THIS EXERCISE: A RETROSPECTIVE IS LIKE A PHOTOGRAPH THAT IMMORTALIZES YOU AT THE PEAK OF YOUR FAME, WHICH AROUSES A FEAR OF SEEING YOURSELF GO DOWNHILL FROM THERE. WAS IT CRUCIAL FOR YOU TO ALSO INCLUDE FURNITURE YOU DESIGNED IN THIS EXHIBITION? YES, BECAUSE IT’S CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH MY FASHION DESIGN. I CALLED THIS EXHIBITION SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN – A TRULY POMPOUS NAME. I TRIED TO MITIGATE THIS PRETENTIOUS ASPECT BY DESCRIBING IT AS A WORK OF ARTE POVERA. AN ARTE POVERA GESAMTKUNSTWERK: IT’S SUCH AN ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS CONCEPT THAT IT CAN’T BE POMPOUS. I ALWAYS WANTED TO OFFER A COMPLETE WAY OF LIFE IN MY CREATIONS, NOT JUST CLOTHES FOR SUNDAY OR SPECIAL OCCASIONS. I WANTED TO HAVE A COMPLETE AND SYSTEMATIC APPROACH BECAUSE IT’S MORE REAL. I RELIED ON WHAT SEEMS RIGHT TO ME. EVERYONE HAS THEIR HEROES. MINE ARE DONALD JUDD AND MICHAEL HEIZER. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO THEIR AESTHETIC. THAT’S THE KIND OF CREATOR I’M INTERESTED IN, AND SO THAT’S THE KIND OF PERSON I TRY TO BE. WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE TITLE OF THE EXHIBITION REFER TO? IT PRESENTS A PROBLEM WE CAN ALL RELATE TO. WE ARE ALL CONSTANTLY DEVALUATING WHO WE ARE, WHO WE’RE TRYING TO BE, AND WHO WE’VE BEEN IN THE PAST. WE EXPERIENCE SHAME, PRIDE, WE’RE SOMETIMES TOTALLY BLIND TO OUR OWN ISSUES. I THINK WE ALL FIND IT HARD TO ACCEPT AND LOVE OURSELVES BECAUSE WE SEE OUR OWN FAULTS SO CLEARLY. WELL, THIS IS ALL AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL. I’M JUST ASSUMING OTHER PEOPLE’S EMOTIONS ARE SIMILAR TO MINE. IN ANY CASE, I THINK MY QUESTIONING AND MY PERMANENT STRUGGLE WITH MYSELF ARE STILL WIDELY SHARED. WE ALL EXPERIENCE MOMENTS WHERE WE’RE INHUMAN, MOMENTS WHERE WE’RE FULL OF OURSELVES, AND MOMENTS WHERE WE DEMONSTRATE TRUE KINDNESS. I’M JUST TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT CONFLICTING FORCES. I DON’T BELIEVE ANYONE IS TRULY SERENE. WE ARE CONSTANTLY STRUGGLING WITH OURSELVES. I THINK THE TITLE OF MY RETROSPECTIVE SUMMARIZES ALL OF THAT PRETTY WELL: IT’S THE STORY OF HUMANITY. SO THIS EXHIBITION IS SORT OF YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY? IT’S TRUE THAT YOU CAN’T DISSOCIATE YOUR WORK FROM YOUR PERSONALITY, UNLIKE FASHION DESIGNERS WHO PRESENT EXTRAVAGANT FIGURES ON THE RUNWAY AND THEN GREET THE AUDIENCE IN BLACK JEANS AND A T-SHIRT... YES, I’VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW THE AUDIENCE DOESN’T FEEL INSULTED. I REALLY DON’T GET IT. BUT IT’S CRAZY... NOW I’M STARTING TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE. IT’S MY INHUMAN SIDE. AFTER ALL, YOU CAN DO THINGS VERY WELL IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM MINE, HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES. YOU SEE, I’M CONSTANTLY CRITICIZING MYSELF, THEN CORRECTING MYSELF, AND THEN FORGIVING MYSELF. I’M VERY BUSY! HAVE YOU EVER TRIED MEDITATION? EXERCISE IS MY MEDITATION. I ALSO TAKE A NAP EVERY DAY. IT CAME NATURALLY TO ME. IT’S NOT LIKE I JUST DECIDED THAT I HAD TO DO THIS RITUAL AS SOME SORT OF MEDITATION. IT ALLOWS ME TO HAVE A MOMENT TO MYSELF. AND WHEN I WAKE UP, I OFTEN HAVE A NEW OUTLOOK ON MY PROBLEMS AND SOMETIMES EVEN A GOOD IDEA. IT’S A FORM OF DISCIPLINE THAT LETS ME MAKE THE MOST OF MY OWN RESOURCES AND CONSERVE MY ENERGY. SO IT’S A KIND OF MEDITATION RITUAL, EVEN THOUGH IT’S PRETTY SPONTANEOUS, EVEN PRIMITIVE. YOU’VE ALWAYS MENTIONED RAGE AS AN ENERGY THAT FUELS CREATION. WHAT PLACE DOES IT HAVE IN YOUR EXHIBITION? I ADDED A SCULPTURAL ELEMENT TO THE MUSEUM THAT RUNS THROUGH ALL THE ROOMS. I SEE IT AS A “PRIMAL” VORTEX, A CONCENTRATION OF DRIVE, AMBITION, ALMOST LIKE A KIND OF ECTOPLASMIC VOMIT. OR EVEN A WORK CREATED FROM THE EARTH, A MOUNTAIN OF RAGE. I’VE BEEN THINKING A LOT LATELY ABOUT THE ROLE OF EVIL IN THE WORLD. EVIL IS A NECESSARY PART OF LIFE. IT’S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT ERADICATING IT, BUT RATHER ABOUT DOING POSITIVE THINGS THAT BALANCE IT OUT. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE THE FORCES OF EVIL HAVE PREVAILED, POLITICALLY. I DON’T CLAIM TO HAVE THE SOLUTION. I JUST THINK ABOUT HOW TO LIVE WITH ALL THIS NEGATIVITY. THE ONLY ANSWER I SEE IS THAT IN COPING WITH DISCOMFORT OR SUFFERING, WE NOW HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF LUXURY: A LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE WE DID NOT HAVE BEFORE. AND KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. THE WORLD HAS NEVER KNOWN SUCH LUXURY. BUT SORRY... WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RAGE. IF I EXPERIENCE RAGE, I ALSO EXPERIENCE MOMENTS OF SERENITY. AND I SEEK SERENITY. BUT I MUST ADMIT THAT RAGE HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF IMMENSE MOTIVATION IN MY LIFE. RAGE HAS SERVED ME WELL. BEING IN A SITUATION OF HAVING TO REACT TO PRESSURE, TO CONFLICT, CAN PROVE TO BE VERY POSITIVE. I USE CHAOS, BUT IN A VERY CONTROLLED WAY, I GUESS. IN MY EXHIBITION, THE MODELS WEARING MY CLOTHES MINGLE WITH DOCUMENTS SUCH AS VIDEOS OF MY FASHION SHOWS SHOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE AND SLOWED DOWN. IT PROVIDES A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS WE’VE ALREADY SEEN. I’M ALSO EXHIBITING INVITATIONS TO MY FASHION SHOWS. THERE’S ALSO A VIDEO I RECORDED ON MY IPHONE IN MY FACTORY IN ITALY. BY CHANCE, I STARTED FILMING MYSELF JUST AS I FOUND A SHAPE THAT BECAME IMPORTANT IN MY WORK, JUST BY DRAPING A FABRIC. IN SHORT, ALL OF THIS CREATES A NARRATIVE. IT’S NOT CHAOTIC, IT’S VERY CONSTRUCTED. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN SEE IT AS A KIND OF STIFFNESS. YOUR AESTHETIC DRAWS ON THE SYMBOLISM OF THE 19TH CENTURY, PUNK, GRUNGE... BUT I CAN ALSO GET INSPIRED BY CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS, AFRICAN SCULPTURES... WE COULD ENTERTAIN OURSELVES BY FINDING ALL THE REFERENCES I EVOKE IN MY DESIGNS ONE BY ONE. BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT CREATORS DO: WE WORK FROM HISTORICAL LAYERS. WE DON’T INVENT ANYTHING NEW; WE JUST FIND NEW WAYS TO PUT TOGETHER EXISTING THINGS. FOR MY EXHIBITION CATALOG, FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS INSPIRED BY MARCEL DUCHAMP’S &quot;VALISES.&quot; I DESIGNED A BOX, WHICH IS MY OWN VERSION OF THESE VALISES. IT ALSO BRINGS TO MIND OLD MUSIC ALBUMS, WITH THEIR BOOKLETS INSIDE, WHICH WERE INVALUABLE. WHEN WE BOUGHT A RECORD OR A CD, WE TREASURED THOSE IMAGES WE FOUND INSIDE THE CASE. I TRIED TO REPRODUCE THIS EFFECT WITH MY BOX. BUT WHEN YOU WORK WITH SOMEONE LIKE THE PERFORMER CHRISTEENE, WHAT IS YOUR GOAL? TO PUSH THE LIMITS OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE? TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE VISION OF BEAUTY? TO ME, CHRISTEENE EMBODIES THE JOY OF ABANDONING CONVENTION AND HYPOCRISY, THE JOY OF LETTING THE “ID” AND YOUR PRIMAL INSTINCTS SPEAK, WHICH ARE VERY INNOCENT AND CHARMING. THERE IS A CHILDLIKE INNOCENCE IN HER PROVOCATION. THE WORLD IS STILL VERY CONSERVATIVE. CLAIMING TO BE SHOCKED BY CHRISTEENE, IN TODAY’S DAY AND AGE, IS FAKE AND DISHONEST. BECAUSE ALL CHRISTEENE DOES IS REPEAT THEMES AND MOTIFS THAT ALREADY EXIST. SHE IS PURE THEATER, A MIX OF COMMEDIA DELL&#39;ARTE, BUSBY BERKELEY’S MUSICAL COMEDIES, GRAND GUIGNOL... THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF CREATIONS I SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY BRING BALANCE TO OUR WORLD. CHRISTEENE’S PERFORMANCES BALANCE OUT PRUDISHNESS, FALSE CONVENTIONS. THAT’S THE ROLE I WANT TO PLAY. I WANT TO BE SOMEONE WHO BRINGS THIS POSITIVE ENERGY, IN MY OWN VERY SMALL WAY. I LIKE PROMOTING THE VALUES I BELIEVE IN AND THAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE ME WITH THOSE VALUES. DO YOU FEEL WE’RE GOING THROUGH A MORE CONSERVATIVE PHASE RIGHT NOW? TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH CAN LAUNCH GLOBAL CONTROVERSIES FROM ONE SECOND TO THE NEXT. I’M STILL SHOCKED TODAY BY THE WAY PEOPLE ANONYMOUSLY RAGE ON THE INTERNET. AND BY HOW QUICKLY DIFFERENCES IN POINTS OF VIEW BECOME VIOLENT CONFLICTS. I AM ASTOUNDED BY HOW READY PEOPLE ARE TO STONE THEIR NEIGHBOR. WHEREAS... WHAT’S THAT PHRASE IN THE BIBLE? “MAY HE WHO HAS NEVER SINNED THROW THE FIRST STONE.&quot; BUT OF COURSE, EVERYONE HAS ALREADY SINNED. ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT PLEASURE OF ANONYMOUSLY ATTACKING OTHERS CREATES FEAR, WHICH LEADS TO THE CURRENT CONSERVATISM. AND WHAT WAS YOUR INTENTION WHEN YOU PRESENTED YOUR FASHION SHOW OF STEP DANCERS A FEW YEARS AGO? WAS THAT A TRIBUTE? IF I WERE TO PRESENT THIS FASHION SHOW TODAY, THEY’D KILL ME. WHILE I KNEW AT THE TIME THAT I WAS MANIPULATING THE ISSUE OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATION, I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO BE ACCUSED OF BEING INSENSITIVE, AND THAT WAS PART OF THE FUN. THINGS HAVE CHANGED IMMENSELY IN FOUR YEARS, AND THIS FASHION SHOW WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TODAY. MAYBE THAT’S A GOOD THING. BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A KIND OF HYPERSENSITIVITY. TODAY’S YOUTH IS HYPERSENSITIVE, AND ALSO MUCH BETTER INFORMED, WHICH GIVES THEM A FEELING OF SUPERIORITY. AND THEY CAN ANONYMOUSLY ATTACK OTHERS ON THE INTERNET. I FIND THAT THIS GAME BECOMES VERY DANGEROUS. LIFE IS SUPPOSED TO BE BOTH VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY UGLY. IT IS UNREALISTIC TO DREAM OF PERFECTION. LIKE I SAID, EVIL AS WELL AS IGNORANCE WILL ALWAYS EXIST. AND MAYBE THERE’S SOME VALUE IN EVIL... I DON’T KNOW. I SOMETIMES THINK A PRIEST COULD EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

GERMAN-MADE, BUILT FOR COMFORT, AND COOL WITH THE COUNTERCULTURE OF BOTH ’70S HIPPIES AND ’90S GRUNGERS, THEY’VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO PASS INTO FAMILIAR INTERNATIONAL PARLANCE AS BIRKS. WHO KNEW, THEN, THAT BIRKENSTOCK HAS NEVER YET INVOLVED ITSELF WITH A FASHION DESIGNER? RICK OWENS DOES, BECAUSE HE’S THE FIRST. “IT’S FUNNY—YOU JUST ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE, BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS DONE THEIR ‘VERSION OF,’ BUT THERE’S NEVER BEEN AN OFFICIAL BIRKENSTOCK-ENDORSED ONE,” HE MARVELS. “THAT’S WHY I WANTED TO DO IT.” SO HOW HAS HE CHOSEN TO INTERVENE IN THE DESIGN OF THE FAMILIAR SANDAL AND CLOG SHAPES WITH THE TIME-HONORED ORTHOPEDIC FOOTBED? WITH RESPECT: “I DIDN’T REALLY WANT TO DO THAT MUCH TO THEM,” HE SAYS LACONICALLY. “I DIDN’T REALLY WANT TO THROW A LOT OF SPANGLES AT IT AND CALL IT A DAY. I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO THE ARCHITECTURE, SO I JUST EXTENDED THE STRAPS SO THEY HIT THE FLOOR, AND I ADDED MORE HOLES, BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADD HOLES THEY BECOME CONFECTION, LIKE LACE. PUNCHING HOLES ALWAYS MAKES SOMETHING MORE DELICATE.” HE DESCRIBES THE TWO-BAR SANDAL IN COWHIDE AS HAVING “STRAPS LIKE FEATHERED WINGS. I DID THEM IN MY COLOR PALETTE OF GRAYS AND PEARLS. THEY’RE ACTUALLY VERY PRETTY!” VERY PUBLIC PROOF OF THE ARRANGEMENT HAS NOW PULLED UP OUTSIDE THE RICK OWENS STORE ON LA BREA AVENUE IN LOS ANGELES, IN THE SHAPE OF A SHIPPING CONTAINER MARKED BIRKENSTOCKBOX.COM/RICK OWENS. THE CORRUGATED-METAL BOX—TO BE OFFICIALLY OPENED APRIL 17—HAS BEEN ON THE MOVE FROM BERLIN, WHERE IT WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE ANDREAS MURKUDIS SHOP, TO THE STREET IN MILAN OPPOSITE THE HIGH-FASHION MAGNET 10 CORSO COMO, AND TO BOTH THE WHITNEY AND BARNEYS NEW YORK, EACH TIME FILLED WITH DIFFERENTLY CURATED BIRKENSTOCK ASSORTMENTS. ON THIS STOP, THE INTERIOR OF THE BIRK BOX HAS BEEN OVERHAULED AS A TOTAL OWENS WORLD. “I’VE FITTED IT OUT WITH MY FURNITURE, WHICH IS UPHOLSTERED IN CAMEL HAIR, FELT, OR FOAM,” OWENS SAYS. “MY GRAY FELT THING IS VERY MUCH ABOUT JOSEPH BEUYS. EVERY COLLECTION, I’VE ALWAYS DONE GRAY FELTED CASHMERE, AND WHEREVER I LIVE, I’VE ALWAYS USED ARMY BLANKETS FOR CARPETS—MY BED IS UPHOLSTERED IN ARMY BLANKETS. THAT’S MY CONNECTION WITH BEUYS.” TO OWENS, THE ATTRACTION TO BEUYS IS PERSONAL, FORMATIVE, AND SURPRISINGLY LOCAL TO L.A. “IT’S MY CONNECTION WITH HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD,” HE EXPLAINS, MULLING OVER HIS BEGINNINGS. “WHEN I FIRST STARTED MAKING CLOTHES, ALL THE PUNK KIDS USED TO BUY ARMY SURPLUS—THEY DYED IT BLACK. THOSE WERE MY FIRST COLLECTIONS, MADE OUT OF USED DUFFEL BAGS AND ARMY BLANKETS FROM HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. THERE’S A MELANCHOLY ROMANCE TO THOSE BLANKETS, BECAUSE THEY’VE BEEN USED IN THE MILITARY.” THE INFLUENCE, HE REVEALS, SEEPED PERMANENTLY INTO THE DEFAULT OWENS COLOR PALETTE. “YOU SEE, THE DYE YOU GET AT THE GROCERY STORE IS CHEAP, AND IT DOESN’T MAKE A GREAT BLACK. SO ARMY-GREEN CLOTHES IN BLACK WOULD FADE INTO THIS WONDERFUL GREEN-MURKY BLACK THAT I ALWAYS USE IN EVERY COLLECTION. I CALL IT EITHER DUST OR DARK SHADOW.” AS ALWAYS, LOOK OUT FOR SOMETHING DEEPER IN ANYTHING OWENS LAYS HIS HANDS ON. AS FOR FEET? THOSE WHO WALK AWAY FROM LA BREA IN A PAIR OF ARMY-FELT BIRKS WILL NOW KNOW THEIR SIGNIFICANCE. IT’S THE ONLY CHANCE TO GET THEM, TOO. “THIS,” HE SAYS, “IS A ONE-SHOT DEAL.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

WHERE DID YOU SPEND YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? RO WELL AT THAT AGE I WAS IN PORTERVILLE — WHICH IS JUST OUTSIDE OF BAKERSFIELD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA — AND I DIDN’T REALLY KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING. I WAS WORKING AT TACO BELL; I WAS JUST THIS POT-SMOKING, TACO BELL GUY. MY AESTHETIC WAS VERY MUCH LIKE SHORT LEVI’S CUTOFFS, FLIP FLOPS, A TANK TOP AND SHAGGY HAIR, LISTENING TO MOTORHEAD AND DRINKING BEER. OKAY WELL … I’M BEING A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS. MY DAD HAD A PRETTY GREAT LIBRARY OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE AND MUSIC IN MY HOUSE SO THERE WAS A LOT OF SHARING AND INTELLECTUAL DISCOURSE — NOT FROM ME, BUT FROM MY FATHER. SO IN A WAY I WAS PLAYING WITH THIS IDENTITY THAT I WANTED TO BE A PORTERVILLE REDNECK — I WANTED TO BE SLUTTY AND WHITE TRASH — BUT I WASN’T. I WAS KIND OF PLAYING THAT ROLE. I WAS DRESSING UP, FAKING IT. CP WERE YOU A ROCKER AT 17? RO I MEAN YEAH, INITIALLY I WANTED TO BE THE LED ZEPPELIN, KISS, MOTORHEAD GUY, BUT THEN I STARTED GETTING INTO GRACE JONES AND BOWIE AS I GOT OLDER. CP HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU HIT THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES? RO I WENT THERE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL TO STUDY ART AT OTIS. IN THE BEGINNING I DIDN’T REALLY EXPLORE L.A. I WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND SCHOOL PARTIES. OTIS AT THAT TIME WAS IN MACARTHUR PARK, SO IT WAS SUPER SKETCHY. BUT, THAT’S ALSO WHAT MADE IT GLAMOROUS AND EXOTIC; IT WAS DANGEROUS. THEN I STARTED OPENING UP, MEETING MORE PEOPLE AND GOING OUT. THERE WERE THESE PUNK-ROCK LEATHER CLUBS CALLED THEORETICALS THAT WERE VERY BIG WITH THE GAY COMMUNITY. WE WOULD GO SEE BANDS LIKE THE SCREAMERS AND FEAR AND BLACK FLAG. AND THERE WAS A PLACE CALLED AL’S BAR THAT A LOT OF BANDS PLAYED AT. CP I LOVED AL’S BAR. RO I STARTED TURNING MORE GAY AND GOING TO THE LEATHER BARS MORE. I WASN’T REALLY INTO S&amp;M AND LEATHER THAT MUCH — WELL NOT AT ALL ACTUALLY — BUT IT WAS KIND OF THE MOST GLAMOROUS SCENE THAT I KNEW OF AND THERE WAS THE PAGEANTRY OF THE COSTUMES AND OF ALL OF THE RITUAL INVOLVED. IT SEEMED VERY SOPHISTICATED TO ME AND ALSO CREEPY AND TRAGIC AT THE SAME TIME. SO THAT WAS MY THING FOR A LONG TIME, THAT AND SEX CLUBS. THE SEX-CLUB LIFE WAS GREAT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST THE DIRTIEST, DARKEST LIFE THAT YOU COULD HAVE AND THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED AT THE TIME. IT WAS THE MOST PIGGY, OINKY LIFE POSSIBLE. CP I THINK I WAS PROBABLY IN A LOT OF THE PLACES YOU WERE IN. I WAS BORN IN COMPTON AND RAISED IN LYNWOOD. I’M VERY WELL VERSED IN EVERYTHING YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT. RO WE PROBABLY RAN INTO EACH OTHER AT RON ATHEY’S, CLUB F CK. DO YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS DIRT BOSS AND POWER TOOLS? CP OH YAH. THAT WAS FUN. RO I NEVER FELT THAT I REALLY FIT IN THOUGH. I KNEW A LOT OF FUN PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING BUT I WASN’T EVER REALLY THE GUY THAT EVERYBODY KNEW AT THE DOOR. I DIDN’T HAVE MUCH POWER THEN. I WASN’T ONE OF THE COOL KIDS. I WAS SOMEBODY WAITING IN LINE. CP YOU MENTIONED DANGER BEFORE. WHAT EXACTLY FELT DANGEROUS THEN? RO SIMPLY BEING ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY, IT WAS A MARGINALIZED WORLD BASED ON THE CHEAPEST SENSATIONS POSSIBLE. AND OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE AIDS AND DRUG ADDICTION AND ALL OF THOSE DANGERS. I STILL THINK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I’VE ENJOYED A DEATH-WISH LIFESTYLE, I’VE ALWAYS DONE WHATEVER IT TOOK TO SURVIVE AND I’VE ALWAYS CLAWED MY WAY OUT … AND THEN I WAS A TOTAL ALCOHOLIC AND AT SOME POINT I DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE. THAT WAS A VOTE FOR SURVIVAL. BUT THEN I STILL SMOKE CIGARETTES, A LOT OF THEM. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE I’M A LOGICAL PERSON AND I WORK OUT LIKE A FIEND. BUT WORKING OUT ISN’T SO MUCH ABOUT HEALTH; I JUST WANT TO LOOK GOOD. I’M PRETTY SUPERFICIAL. BUT I KEEP SMOKING AND I LOVE SMOKING AND I KNOW THAT THERE’S A DEATH WISH THERE SOMEWHERE. I’M CHALLENGING MY HEALTH AND PLAYING WITH THIS THREAT. I DON’T KNOW IF IT IS ABOUT STAYING IN TOUCH WITH MY MORTALITY, JUST TO FIND COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT IT’S INEVITABLE. IT’S NOT GOING TO BE A SHOCKING STRANGER WHEN IT ARRIVES. CP I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY LIVED IN AN ERA WITH DANGER. AS A 51-YEAR-OLD MAN, I DON’T FEEL THE DANGERS THAT I FELT AS A KID AND I DON’T KNOW IF THEY EXIST ANYMORE. RO WELL WHEN WE GET OLDER OUR FRIENDS START GETTING OLDER AND SICK AND DYING, SO WE START SEEING HOW FRAGILE LIFE CAN BE. I REMEMBER LOVING DANGER AND I DON’T REMEMBER FEELING FEAR. I REMEMBER FEELING IMMORTAL AND I REMEMBER FEELING THAT I WANTED TO BE AS DANGEROUS AS POSSIBLE. NOW I LOVE THE IDEA OF DANGER AND THE IDEA OF TAKING RISKS. BUT I DON’T DRINK ANY MORE AT ALL BECAUSE IT’S TOO MUCH TROUBLE. THE HANGOVERS ENDED UP BEING JUST SO NOT WORTH IT. AND I’M AN UGLY DRUNK; IT BRINGS OUT A SIDE OF ME THAT I PROBABLY SUPPRESS. BUT I LOVE HAVING PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO ARE DRINKING AND DOING DRUGS — AS LONG AS THEY’RE FUN. I KEEP LIQUOR AROUND THE HOUSE AND IF PEOPLE WANT TO DO DRUGS I’M ALL FOR IT; I THINK DRUGS ARE GREAT. BUT I’M JUST NOT GOOD AT THEM. CP DO YOU STILL SMOKE WEED? RO NO, BUT I DID WHEN I WAS TRYING TO STOP DRINKING, JUST SO I COULD TRY AND GET TO SLEEP. BUT I NEVER REALLY ENJOYED IT THAT MUCH. I LIKE PSYCHEDELICS AND I LIKE SPEED MORE. I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MUSHROOMS IN MY HOUSE FOR LIKE A FUN NIGHT OR SOMETHING, BUT I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO IT. IT’S SOMETHING I KEEP FOR GUESTS. BUT I COMPLETELY INTEND TO INDULGE MYSELF IN MY 80’S. I’M GONNA GO ALL OUT. CP DID YOU THINK THAT YOU WOULD LIVE THIS LONG WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER? RO I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT AHEAD. I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF THE FUTURE LIKE THAT. MY BIGGEST AMBITION WAS PROBABLY TO HAVE A COOL LOFT IN DOWNTOWN L.A. OR SOMETHING. THINKING OF MOVING TO EUROPE WAS LIKE THINKING OF MOVING TO THE MOON. CP HOLLYWOOD WAS A VERY SPECIAL TIME BACK WHEN YOU WERE THERE. IT WAS SO GRITTY AND CHEAP AND EVERYBODY WAS THERE. I HAVE DISTINCT MEMORIES OF PEOPLE LIKE SEAN DELEAR. THE FEARLESSNESS OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM REALLY IMPACTED ME. HE REPRESENTED SO MUCH OF WHAT IT MEANT TO BE FEARLESS AND WALK THE WALK AND BE TRUE TO YOURSELF. IN 1979, WHEN HE WAS 15 YEARS OLD, HE WAS THE ONLY BLACK KID IN SIMI VALLEY. HE’D HANG AROUND IN BOWLING ALLE GLORY HOLES AND FLEA MARKET PARKING LOTS SUCKING DICKS. DO YOU SEE THAT FEARLESSNESS TODAY IN PEOPLE? RO I JUST SAW VAGINAL DAVIS LAST WEEK AT BERGHAIN IN BERLIN. SHE WAS OPENING FOR CHRISTEENE WHO HAS ALL OF THAT RAW GLAMOUR AND DEPRAVITY AND FEARLESSNESS AND RECKLESSNESS THAT I ALWAYS WANTED. SO I DO SEE THAT HAPPENING NOW. CP ARE YOU LATINO? RO MY MOTHER’S MEXICAN. SHE LEFT HER FAMILY IN PUEBLA TO COME LIVE IN THE STATES WITH MY FATHER, WHO WAS ANGLO FROM PHILADELPHIA, AND THEY MOVED TO PORTERVILLE. BUT OUR COMMUNITY WASN’T VERY LATINO. PORTERVILLE IS PRETTY SMALL AND ANYBODY LATINO WAS PRETTY INTEGRATED INTO THE REGULAR CULTURE. WHAT’S FUNNY IS THAT MY FATHER HAD A KIND OF RACIST STREAK, WHICH I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD, BECAUSE HE DELIBERATELY WENT TO MEXICO TO FIND A WIFE WHO HAD OLD-FASHIONED VALUES. HE THOUGHT AMERICAN WOMEN WERE TOO INDEPENDENT. HE WANTED TO FIND A WIFE WHO WOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE THE MAN. SO HE HAD REALLY TROUBLING RACIAL ATTITUDES, BUT THEN IT WAS OKAY FOR HIM TO HAVE A CHILD WITH AN “INFERIOR” MEXICAN. CP DID YOU SPEAK SPANISH AT HOME AT ALL WITH YOUR MOTHER? RO WHEN SHE MOVED TO THE STATES SHE DIDN’T SPEAK ENGLISH, SO SPANISH WAS THE FIRST LANGUAGE I LEARNED. WHEN I STARTED GOING TO SCHOOL SHE WOULD TAKE ME AND SIT IN THE BACK AND SHE QUIETLY LEARNED ENGLISH. AND NOT ONLY THAT, SHE BECAME INDISPENSABLE TO THE TEACHERS SO THEY HIRED HER AS A TEACHER’S AID. SHE ENDED UP RETIRING FROM THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WITH COMPLETE BENEFITS. SHE IS REALLY AMAZING. SHE’S A VERY QUIET, VERY SWEET, LOVING WOMEN. BUT THERE IS THIS KIND OF INVISIBLE STEELINESS IN HER, WHERE SHE KNOWS HOW TO GET WHERE SHE NEEDS TO BE. SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE FROM HER ENTIRE FAMILY WHO LEFT PUEBLA. AND WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND IT WAS LOOKING LIKE I WAS GONNA TURN INTO SOME WHITE-TRASH MEXICAN, SHE DROVE ME TO LOS ANGELES AND ENROLLED ME IN ART SCHOOL — EVEN THOUGH I WAS HER ONLY SON. SHE FORCED ME OUT OF THE NEST, WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD FOR HER. SHE KNEW THAT I HAD TO PURSUE SOME HIGHER DESTINY. AND SHE KNEW I WAS GAY — WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT I’M SURE THAT SHE SAW THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING AND THAT PORTERVILLE WAS GONNA EAT ME ALIVE. CP WERE YOU A BAD BOY? RO WELL, YEAH! LIKE HER WAKING ME UP ON THE FRONT LAWN NAKED, IN MY OWN VOMIT… YOU KNOW I JUST CAN’T BELIEVE THAT I NEVER KILLED ANYONE, LIKE DRUNK DRIVING IN SOME HORRIBLE ACCIDENT. IT’S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT I GOT THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND DIDN’T HURT ANYONE. IT’S A MIRACLE. CP DID YOU HAVE ANY DALLIANCES WITH OLDER FIGURES WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER? RO [LAUGHS] ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS 17 AND GOING OUT WITH A 35-YEAR-OLD GUY; HE CAME TO PICK ME UP TO GO AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND AND MY PARENTS WERE SO INNOCENT. I REMEMBER MY DAD WAS WASHING HIS CAR WHILE I WAS GETTING INTO THIS OLDER MAN’S VEHICLE. AND MY DAD PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID “YOU KNOW RICHARD, SOMETIMES WHEN YOU’RE A YOUNG GUY LIKE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT OLDER GUYS — JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT.” HE HAD NO IDEA; IT DIDN’T EVEN OCCUR TO HIM THAT WE WERE F CKING. CP BUT YOUR MOM KNEW? RO WELL, I’VE NEVER ASKED HER, BUT I’M SURE SHE DID. EVEN BEFORE WE TALKED ABOUT IT, LOOKING BACK ON IT NOW, I’M SURE SHE KNEW BECAUSE SHE’S AN INSTINCTIVE PERSON. CP SO WHERE DID YOU GO FOR THE WEEKEND? RO WITH WHAT’S HIS NAME? OH! HIS NAME WAS JIM! WE WENT TO HIS PLACE ABOUT 45 MINUTES AWAY. HE LIVED WITH ROOMMATES WHO WERE ALWAYS NAKED AND HAVING SEX. IT WAS LIKE THIS ORGY HOUSE IN VISALIA, WHICH IS JUST LIKE SUCH AN AVERAGE SORT OF CITY. BUT THAT’S WHERE ALL THE DEPRAVITY WAS IN THOSE DAYS … EXCEPT FOR HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD; THAT WAS ABOUT AS DEPRAVED AS IT EVER GOT FOR ME REALLY — DOING CRYSTAL METH WITH FRIENDS IN MY APARTMENT. I HAD THIS WONDERFUL APARTMENT ON WILCOX AND LOS PALMAS AND THAT WAS LIKE CRACK CORNER. IT WAS INTENSE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT IN THIS OLD HOLLYWOOD BUILDING. IT WAS JUST LOVELY AND THAT WAS PROBABLY AS DEPRAVED AS MY LIFE EVER WAS. CP WHERE DID YOU LOSE YOUR VIRGINITY? RO WHICH ONE? CP YOU TELL ME. RO THERE WAS A GUY I REALLY LIKED, BUT HE WASN’T INTO ME. SO I WENT WITH HIS BEST FRIEND AND THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME. I WAS MAYBE 16 OR 17. I MEAN, IT WASN’T THAT EARLY. I WAS KIND OF A LATE BLOOMER. CP WERE YOU SCARED? RO OH GOD NO! CP DID YOU PLAY SPORTS IN HIGH SCHOOL? RO NO, I WAS NOT A JOCK AT ALL. I WAS PROBABLY MORE EFFEMINATE THAN I AM NOW. I WAS A LOT MORE VAIN AND MY CLOTHES WERE MORE VAIN. MY BODY WAS VERY SOFT, WITH SMALL SHOULDERS. I HAD FULL MAKEUP ON ALL THE TIME, EVEN WHEN I WENT TO BED, EYELINER ALL THE TIME. IT WAS CHANEL FOUNDATION WITH POWDER AND EYE MASCARA AND THE WHOLE THING. BUT NO LIPSTICK. IT WAS GLAM, BUT I WAS NEVER REALLY INTERESTED IN BEING A WOMAN; I WAS INTERESTED IN BEING DAVID BOWIE OR KLAUS NOMI. I DIDN’T EVER WANT TO BE A GIRL, EVER. I’VE NEVER EVER DRESSED IN DRAG; ISN’T THAT FUNNY? CP I ONLY DID ONCE. BUT YEAH, I REMEMBER ALWAYS HAVING EYELINER ON IN THE ’80S. DID YOU TEASE YOUR HAIR AND HAVE THE BIG BLOWOUT? RO NO ACTUALLY I WAS GOING FOR A MORE SLEEK LOOK, THE YOUNG AMERICAN ALBUM-COVER LOOK. I HAD MY HAIR SHAVED ON THE SIDES IN A KIND OF FAUX-HAWK, BUT IT WAS ALL GELLED BACK. AND I HAD THE NOSE RING WITH THE ROSEMARY BEADS FROM MY NOSE TO MY EAR — A VERY CHRISTIAN DEATH LOOK. YOU KNOW WHAT? THE FIRST TIME I MET RON ATHEY, I WAS IN LOVVVVVVVEEE WITH HIM. I HAD THIS JOB WHERE I SCOUTED EXTRAS FOR SOME STUPID MOVIE FOR SOME GOTH CLUB SCENE AND I GOT RON TO BE AN EXTRA. HE WAS WORKING AT THAT PUNK CLUB, POSER. WE WERE REALLY YOUNG AND HE HAD WAY FEWER TATTOOS. HE WAS VERY THIN AND WHITE AND HE HAD THESE REALLY TALL SPIKES ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. AND ANYWAYS HE WAS MY STYLE ICON FROM THEN ON BECAUSE HE WAS JUST THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE I HAD EVER SEEN. AND ACTUALLY WE HOOKED UP AT A PARTY NOT LONG AFTER THAT. I WAS GOING OUT WITH THE LEAD SINGER OF RED WEDDING, MICHAEL. AND WE WENT TO SOME PARTY ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS IN L.A. AND RON WAS THERE. AND WE SNUCK OUT AND HAD SEX ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS, AND THEN I WENT HOME WITH MICHAEL AND MICHAEL’S THEN LOVER, SPIDER. CP TRASH! RO YEAH, TOTALLY. YOU’RE TAKING ME DOWN MEMORY LANE. CP NOW LET’S GET TO THE PRESENT HERE A LITTLE? WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THE KIDS NOW? RO I LIVE IN PARIS AND I’M NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE KIDS BECAUSE THEY’RE NOT SURPRISING ME. THEY’RE NOT SHOCKING ME. THEY’RE NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH. BUT I JUST PROBABLY DON’T KNOW WHAT’S REALLY OUT THERE, BECAUSE I HAVEN’T REALLY BEEN RESEARCHING. AND IN PARIS, THE YOUTH CULTURE IS SO CONSERVATIVE. THERE’S NOT REALLY A YOUTH SCENE THAT I’VE COME ACROSS THAT LOOKS EXCITING. I’LL GO OUT DANCING EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE TO THIS TECHNO THING, BUT THAT’S REALLY IT. I’M FRIENDS WITH LEATHER RITA FROM THE HOUSE OF LINGERIE AND THEY HAVE VOGUING BALLS THAT I GO TO. I REALLY ENJOY THOSE BECAUSE VOGUING HAS BECOME SO RAW AND SO HARDCORE. IT’S LIKE THE MOSH PITS OF THE OLD DAYS; THERE ARE PEOPLE WILDLY THROWING THEMSELVES DOWN ON THE FLOOR IN HIGH HEELS. I DON’T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT WITHOUT BREAKING THEIR BACKS. AND IT’S JUST AS THRILLING AS BEING IN A MOSH PIT AT A FEAR CONCERT TO ME NOW CP BEING FROM CALIFORNIA, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT NOW? RO I HAVE NO IDEA, HAVEN’T BEEN BACK IN 20-SOMETHING YEARS. CP SO YOU REALLY WALKED AWAY FROM THE PAST? RO NOT DELIBERATELY, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OPPORTUNITIES TO GO BACK TO L.A. AND I’VE AVOIDED THEM. I’VE BEEN AWAY FOR SO LONG THAT IT WOULD JUST SEEM SO MELODRAMATIC TO RETURN. I WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO DO IT QUIETLY AND GENTLY. OR MAYBE NOBODY WOULD EVEN CARE OR KNOW IF I WAS BACK. MAYBE I’M OVERTHINKING IT. MAYBE I SHOULD GET OVER MYSELF … THE OTHER THING IS THAT I REMEMBER BEING VERY MESSY IN L.A. AND I DON’T REALLY FEEL LIKE REMEMBERING THAT. IN L.A. I WAS DYING FROM ALCOHOLISM; I WAS FRUSTRATED. I WAS NOT MAKING ANY PROGRESS AND I WAS BITTER. THAT’S WHAT I DON’T WANT TO LOOK AT AGAIN. AND I FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE REMINDED OF THAT, SO I’M NOT IN A BIG HURRY … AND EVERYBODY WHOM I CARE ABOUT ENDS UP IN EUROPE ANYWAY. CP WHERE IS MOM? RO MOM’S STILL IN PORTERVILLE, BUT COMES TO EVERY WOMEN’S RUNWAY SHOW AND WE HAVE A GOOD TIME. AT SOME POINT I MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO PORTERVILLE WHEN SHE’S TOO TIRED TO COME TO EUROPE. I HAVE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT. BUT I’M IN NO HURRY. CP GIVE ME A GOOD DEFINING REBELLIOUS MOMENT OF YOUR YOUTH THAT CHANGED YOU. RO I REMEMBER I WENT WITH TOM FINN TO THE ODYSSEY IN L.A. — TOM WAS THE GUY THAT I WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT WASN’T INTO ME SO I ENDED UP SLEEPING WITH HIS FRIEND. WE WERE ON BLACK BEAUTY AND DRINKING AND THE ODYSSEY WAS LIKE STUDIO 54 FOR ME. I HAD NEVER REALLY BEEN SOMEPLACE SO BIG LIKE THAT AND SO GAY AND BEAUTIFUL AND RICH AND SOPHISTICATED AND URBAN. I HAD NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE THAT URBAN. IT WAS THIS WHOLE WORLD THAT I HAD KIND OF KNOWN EXISTED BUT HAD NEVER REALLY TASTED. SO THAT WAS KIND OF DRAMATIC AND THEN YOU’RE HIGH AND IT’S ALL MORE EXCITING. CP DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE WEARING? RO I WAS WEARING TRASH-BAG PANTS AND SOME KIND OF TANK TOP. AFTERWARDS WE WERE GONNA DRIVE BACK TO PORTERVILLE BUT WE MET SOME GUY AT A BATHROOM GAS STATION AND WENT HOME WITH HIM. HE WAS YOUNG, OUR AGE, AND SEEMED TO BE LIVING WITH AN OLDER GUY WHO HAD A TRICK AND THEY WERE PASSED OUT NAKED IN THE LIVING ROOM. SO WE ALL WENT TO THIS GUY’S BEDROOM, BUT HE DIDN’T HAVE A BED; THIS WHOLE APARTMENT WAS EMPTY AND WE WERE GONNA SLEEP ON THE FLOOR. THEN TOM AND THIS GUY STARTED FOOLING AROUND SO I GOT UP AND I WENT TO THE COUCH IN THE LIVING ROOM. AND THEN THEY FINISHED AND THE GUY CAME OUT AND PUT ON HIS UNDERWEAR AND GOES, REFERRING TO TOM, “OH SORRY MAN. ARE YOU GUYS TOGETHER OR SOMETHING?” AND I SAID, “OH NO, IT’S LIKE NO PROBLEM.” AND THEN HE STARTED SHOWING ME PICTURES OF HIS BABY THAT HE HAD JUST HAD. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST MISERABLE TIMES IN MY LIFE … LISTENING TO THIS GUY, THAT I WAS REALLY INTO, F CKING THIS OTHER GUY IN THE BEDROOM NEXT DOOR. AND I REMEMBER THERE WAS A CAT WATCHING, AND I WAS WATCHING THE CAT, WATCHING THEM F CKING THROUGH THE DOOR. ISN’T THAT TRAGIC? CP AND YOU WERE WHAT 17? RO YEAH AND I HAD THIS GREAT CAR, A 1960S CONVERTIBLE RAMBLER WITH RED VINYL INTERIOR AND A BLACK CLOTH TOP. IT WAS A GREAT CAR TO RUN AROUND IN THOSE DAYS. CP WHAT KIND OF UNDERWEAR DID THE GUY HAVE ON? RO I THINK THEY WERE JUST TIGHTY WHITIES. CP LOVE TIGHTY WHITIES.

WHAT’S NOTABLE ABOUT THE OWENS COLLABORATION — IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT THE POP-UP WILL BE IN FRONT OF HIS LA BREA AVENUE BOUTIQUE FROM APRIL 17 TO 21 — IS THAT ALL OF THE PREVIOUS PERIPATETIC POP-UPS HAVE BEEN PARTNERSHIPS WITH MULTI-BRAND RETAILERS INCLUDING BERLIN’S ANDREAS MURKUDIS, MILAN’S 10 CORSO COMO AND BARNEYS NEW YORK. “THE CONCEPT WAS NEVER TO RE-PEAT A CERTAIN FORMAT,” SAID BIRKENSTOCK CHIEF EXECUTIVE OLIVER REICHERT OF THE DECISION TO PARTNER WITH A SINGLE DESIGNER FOR THE BOX PROJECT. “IT IS ABOUT LOCATIONS, CHOOSING THE RIGHT CREATIVE [PARTNER], PRODUCT AND WORKING WITH DIVERSE CREATIVE FIELDS. FASHION IS NOW ONE ASPECT, BUT DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES WILL FOLLOW.” REICHERT WAS LESS CIRCUMSPECT WHEN IT CAME TO HIGHLIGHTING WHAT MADE OWENS A GOOD COLLABORATOR. “HE IS UNMISTAKABLE AND BEYOND FASHION,” HE SAID. “THE WHOLE BOX INTERIOR, ARCHITECTURE AND OBJECTS WERE DEFINED BY RICK OWENS. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN CLOTHES.” SPECIFICALLY, THERE ARE THREE CLASSIC BIRKENSTOCK SILHOUETTES — THE TWO-STRAP ARIZONA SANDAL; THE SINGLE-STRAP MADRID; AND THE SLIP-ON BOSTON CLOG — THAT OWENS HAS SERVED UP IN NOVEL FABRICATIONS THAT INCLUDE HAIRY GRAY OR BLACK COWHIDE, DIRT-BROWN FELT, TAUPE-COLORED SUEDE AND BLACK FULL-GRAIN LEATHER. OTHER TWEAKS ARE MORE SUBTLE; SANDAL STRAPS HAVE BEEN ELONGATED SO FAR PAST THE BUCKLE THAT THEY COME CLOSE TO DANGLING ON THE FLOOR, EACH ONE PUNCTUATED WITH NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS MANY BUCKLE HOLES AS YOU’D FIND ON STANDARD BIRKS. THE COLLABORATION ALSO INCLUDES OWENS’ RIFF ON BIRKENSTOCK’S SOCKS, WHICH WILL ALSO BE STOCKED IN THE BOX. (OWENS HAS ALSO DESIGNED A SEPARATE READY-TO-WEAR CAPSULE COLLECTION THAT’S ONLY BEING SOLD IN THE BOX SPACE.) FOOTWEAR IN THE BIRKENSTOCK X RICK OWENS COLLECTION WILL RETAIL FROM $350 TO $525 WITH HOSIERY RANGING FROM $94.95 TO$149.95. IN ADVANCE OF THE COLLABORATION’S RELEASE (THE FOOTWEAR IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER AT WWW.RICKOWENS.EU), WE HOPPED ON THE PHONE WITH FASHION’S DARK PRINCE FOR A TRANSATLANTIC CONVERSATION THAT TOUCHED ON HIS INSPIRATION, NUDIST CAMPS AND MUSING ON WHETHER GERMAN ARTIST JOSEPH BEUYS EVER WORE BIRKENSTOCKS. HERE ARE SOME EXCERPTS FROM THAT CONVERSATION. WHEN DID BIRKENSTOCK FIRST CROSS YOUR RADAR? I REMEMBER [THEM] AS A KID GROWING UP IN PORTERVILLE [CALIF.]. I REMEMBER BIRKENSTOCK HAVING A COUNTERCULTURE ALLURE THEN. THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN’T FRIVOLOUSLY PRETTY MADE THEM THE OPPOSITE OF FASHION, WHICH WAS KIND OF A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS AND STUDIOUS. AND I DON’T THINK THAT COOL COUNTERCULTURE THING HAS REALLY CHANGED. WHO WAS WEARING BIRKENSTOCKS AT THAT TIME? IN THE ’70S, WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I FEEL LIKE IT WAS THE SCRUFFIER, SURFER/SKIER KIDS WHO WORE THEM. [BIRKENSTOCKS] ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTSIDER APPEAL. ALSO, THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT WORE THEM SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE MORE ACTIVE AND OUTDOORSY SO THAT HAD TREMENDOUS APPEAL TOO. …THE OTHER THING I THINK ABOUT WHEN I THINK OF BIRKENSTOCK IS THOSE 1930S SUN-WORSHIPING NUDIST CAMPS THAT I KIND OF ASSOCIATE WITH GERMANY IN THE ’30S, AND THAT’S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT COMES TO MY MIND. [BIRKENSTOCKS] WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT THING FOR ONE OF THOSE NUDIST CAMPS. DO YOU WEAR BIRKENSTOCKS? I DO. I WEAR THEM AT THE BEACH. I DON’T WEAR THEM IN THE CITY. I’M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DOESN’T THINK THAT SANDALS REALLY BELONG IN THE CITY. I’M KIND OF A TRADITIONALIST THAT WAY. AND I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING. I HAVE THIS WEIRD THING WHERE I DON’T PARTICULARLY LIKE SEEING MEN’S FEET. AH, SO THAT EXPLAINS WHY ALL THE MODELS IN THE BIRKENSTOCK X RICK OWENS LOOK BOOK ARE WEARING SOCKS. DID YOU DESIGN THOSE? I TOOK THEIR [SOCK DESIGNS] AND ALTERED THEM, MADE THEM LONGER. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I DO, WHEN I LOOK BACK ON WHAT I MIGHT REPRESENT [IN THE COLLABORATION], A LOT OF THE BASIC STUFF I’VE DONE, IT’S ALWAYS GOING A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR. THE T-SHIRTS ARE A LITTLE BIT LONG. THE SHOES ARE LITTLE BIT TOO BIG. IT’S THE VERY KIND OF LITERAL, ALMOST INNOCENT, INTERPRETATION OF THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. IT’S A SUBTLE WAY OF SUGGESTING THAT THE RULES THAT WE’VE BEEN TOLD DON’T NECESSARILY [APPLY]. AND THAT’S KIND OF WHAT I WAS DOING WITH BIRKENSTOCK. I THOUGHT, ‘WELL, YOU KNOW, I COULD PUT SEQUINS ON THEM. I COULD MAKE THEM IN CORDOVAN LEATHER OR ALLIGATOR OR SOMETHING,’ BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE PROFOUND TO ACTUALLY ALTER THEIR SHAPE. SO I EXTENDED THE STRAPS BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING CLOTHES, MY WOMEN’S DAY DRESSES HAD TRAINS AND THINGS WERE TRAILING, AND THINGS WERE FALLING OFF. AND SO THAT’S KIND OF WHAT I DID WITH [THE] BIRKENSTOCKS. I MADE THE STRAPS A LITTLE TOO LONG AND WHEN THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO ME, THERE’S A SUBTLE NOTE OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND IMPRACTICALITY.… SO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO SOMETHING THAT’S VERY PRACTICAL LIKE A BIRKENSTOCK WAS WHAT MADE OUR COLLABORATION MAKE SENSE. ONE OF THE MATERIALS YOU USED IS LONG-HAIRED COWHIDE, WHICH SEEMS SORT OF IMPRACTICAL, BUT HOW ELSE DID YOU ADD THAT SENSE OF EXTRAVAGANCE? I ALSO ADDED MORE HOLES FOR THE BUCKLE THAN WERE NECESSARY BECAUSE THOSE HOLES ADD A NOTE OF CONFECTION. IN A VERY ABSTRACT WAY, IT’S ON ITS WAY TO LACE, WHICH IS A CONFECTION, AND IT WAS JUST ENOUGH OF A DECORATIVE ELEMENT FOR ME. WAS THERE ANY SPECIFIC INSPIRATION BEYOND THAT? NO, THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT. I JUST THOUGHT, ‘HOW CAN I GIVE THE RICK OWENS TOUCH TO SOMETHING SO SOLID AND WITH SUCH A SENSE OF HONOR?’ IT SEEMS LIKE THE BRAND HAS MAINTAINED ITS INTEGRITY AND STOOD THE TEST OF TIME BY NOT LABORING. …WHO WOULDN’T WANT TO BE A BRAND LIKE THAT? IN ADDITION TO THE FOOTWEAR AND SOCK COLLABORATION, YOU DESIGNED THE INTERIOR OF THE ACTUAL BOX SPACE — THE TWO SHIPPING CONTAINERS THAT WILL BE STACKED OUTSIDE YOUR LA BREA AVENUE STORE. WHAT INSPIRED THE LOOK CUSTOMERS WILL FIND INSIDE? WHEN I THINK OF GERMANY, I [THINK OF] JOSEPH BEUYS AND I WONDERED IF JOSEPH BEUYS EVER WORE BIRKENSTOCKS. YOU THINK HE WOULD — THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. I USE GRAY FELT IN MY COLLECTIONS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE OF BEUYS, AND IT’S WHY I USED FELT AS ONE OF THE FABRIC OPTIONS IN THE BIRKENSTOCKS [IN THE COLLECTION]. SO I THOUGHT THE STORE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A JOSEPH BEUYS TEMPLE. THE INTERIOR [ALSO] INCLUDES SOME OF THE FURNITURE THAT I’VE BEEN DOING, UPHOLSTERED IN GRAY FELT, TO CREATE A KIND OF NICE, COCOON[-LIKE] ENVIRONMENT. MY OTHER THOUGHT WHEN I LOOKED AT THAT SPACE WAS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE PLACES IN THE WORLD — LE CORBUSIER’S SUMMER CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. IT’S A SMALL, ONE-ROOM CABIN, BUT THE WAY IT WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH THE WOOD INTERIOR MAKES IT THE ULTIMATE LE CORBUSIER WOMB. SO WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE BOX, I ENVISIONED A CROSS BETWEEN THAT CABIN AND A JOSEPH BEUYS TEMPLE.

HOWEVER BOMBASTIC THIS SOUNDS, THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS OF THE FASHION AND FURNITURE DESIGNER’S CAREER HAVE BROADLY CONFIRMED HIS INTENTION. AND NOW THAT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO HAS CELEBRATED HIM WITH A RETROSPECTIVE—NO LESS SENSATIONALLY TITLED “SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN,” PRESENTED BY ELEONORA FIORANI, THE CURATOR OF ITS FASHION DEPARTMENT—THE TURD CITED IN OWENS’S MANIFESTO HAS FOUND MATERIAL FORM. IN A GIGANTIC SCULPTURE/STAGE SET, A BLACK BLOB OF SAND, CEMENT, AND ORGANIC MATERIALS (INCLUDING THE ARTIST’S OWN HAIR) TWISTED AND TURNED, WINDING ABOVE AND BELOW THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE EXHIBITION PATH. AROUND AND BENEATH THE SCULPTURE, PRIMAL HOWL, 2017, A CROWD OF MANNEQUINS FLAUNTED SOME OF THE CLOTHING FOR WHICH OWENS HAS GAINED A CULT FOLLOWING. THE NONCHRONOLOGICAL PRESENTATION OPENED WITH A SIZABLE ENSEMBLE OF WOMEN’S WEAR IN EXQUISITE SHADES OF IVORY WHITE, DRAPED IN ARCHAIC STYLE, WITH THE MANNEQUINS POSITIONED HIGH UP LIKE TEMPLE CARYATIDS—BUT THE FIGURES ALL HAD MALE FEATURES. THE CENTRAL SECTION, WHERE BLACK PREDOMINATED ALONGSIDE LEATHER HIDES, HELPED TO EXPLAIN LABELS SUCH AS “GLUNGE” (A CONTRACTION OF “GLAMOUR” AND “GRUNGE”) AND “AVANT-GOTH,” COINED TO DEFINE OWENS’S AESTHETIC. WHAT STOOD OUT IN THE FINAL PORTION, WHICH FOLLOWED CLOTHING FROM HIS RUNWAY SHOWS FROM RECENT YEARS (ALSO SEEN IN A SELECTION OF VIDEOS), WERE UNEXPECTED EXPLOSIONS OF COLOR, WHILE THE FORMS OF THE GARMENTS, INCREASINGLY EXTREME, SHOWED THE DESIGNER FOLLOWING A SCULPTURAL LOGIC THAT DISREGARDED THE LINES OF THE BODY. THROUGH ALL THESE MUTATIONS, OWENS’S STYLE STILL REMAINED PROFOUNDLY CONSISTENT, MARKED BY TWO BASIC AND DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS: THE DESIGNER’S TENDENCY TO IGNORE THE PRESENT TO ADDRESS EITHER THE DISTANT PAST OR AN IMAGINED AND OFTEN POSTAPOCALYPTIC FUTURE, AND HIS INDIFFERENCE TO FUNCTIONALITY IN FAVOR OF A STRONG SYMBOLIC CHARGE, IN TURN PRIESTLY OR WARLIKE: CAPES INSTEAD OF JACKETS; TUNICS RATHER THAN DRESSES; HIGH, FUTURISTIC BUSKINS AS SHOES. MISSING HERE WAS AN EXAMINATION OF OWENS’S SOURCES OF INSPIRATION, RANGING FROM ANCIENT ART TO CONTEMPORARY SUBCULTURES, FROM FIN DE SIÈCLE SYMBOLISM TO BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE, FROM CONSTANTIN BRANCUSI TO ARTE POVERA. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FASCINATING TO SEE THE DESIGNER’S CLOTHING (AND HIS FURNITURE, INCIDENTALLY, WHICH WAS UNDERREPRESENTED HERE) ALONGSIDE SOME OF THE WORKS THAT CONSTITUTE HIS REFERENCE POINTS—AS ONE WAS ABLE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE 2016–17 FURNITURE RETROSPECTIVE AT THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN LOS ANGELES, WHERE OWENS’S MONUMENTAL BENCHES AND TABLES WERE JUXTAPOSED WITH PAINTINGS BY ONE OF HIS FAVORITE CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS, STEVEN PARRINO. ALSO PERHAPS NOT EXAMINED IN SUFFICIENT DEPTH WAS THE ECCENTRIC AND MAUDIT AURA THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF OWENS’S PERSONA—A HALO IMBUED WITH QUEER EROTICISM, GOTHIC IMAGINATION, AND HOLLYWOOD EXTRAVAGANCE. THE FACT THAT OWENS MANAGES TO HAVE THESE COEXIST WITH A VEIN OF GENTLEMANLY IRONY AND TACT SAYS MUCH ABOUT HIS ORIGINALITY. THE MILAN EXHIBITION SCRIMPED ON THIS ASPECT OF HIS WORK, CRUCIAL TO THE OWENS CULT, EXCEPT FOR SOME DISPLAY CASES WHERE VIEWERS COULD FIND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A GOATSKIN COCK RING IN A TOAD-SKIN POUCH; A SKULL; LONG WOMEN’S GLOVES, TANNED IN A WAY THAT MAKES THEM TRANSPARENT; SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF GODDESS BUNNY, A DISABLED TRANSGENDER TAP DANCER; A PACKAGE OF PERSONALIZED M&amp;M’S, ALL A LEADEN-GRAY COLOR; THE BRONZE CAST OF AN OSTRICH EGG; A TINY CONE-SHAPED PARTY HAT MADE OF LEATHER; AND SO ON.BUT THIS WAS ONLY A SMALL OPENING ONTO OWENS’S IMAGINATION, A DOOR BARELY LEFT AJAR. TO GO FURTHER WOULD HAVE REQUIRED—MORE THAN A TICKET FOR THE TRIENNALE EXHIBITION—AN INVITATION TO THE STYLIST’S PARTIES, SUCH AS THE ONE HELD IN MILAN THIS PAST JANUARY TO CELEBRATE THIS SHOW, WHERE GUESTS WERE WELCOMED BY VALETS CLAD IN BLACK TUNICS AND HOLDING THE REINS OF WHITE HORSES, AND WHERE NAKED, OVERWEIGHT MALE PERFORMERS COVERED IN TALCUM POWDER, SPORTING LONG WHITE BEARDS, EXECUTED DANCE MOVES ATOP TALL BLACK PLATFORMS. A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF OWENS’S UNIVERSE WOULD CALL FOR AN EXHIBITION THAT WAS ALSO A PARTY (OR A PARTY THAT INCLUDED AN EXHIBITION). UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, “SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN” CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS THE MOST COMPLETE INTRODUCTION AVAILABLE THUS FAR TO THE WORK OF THIS ECCENTRIC AND VISIONARY CONTEMPORARY CREATOR.

AS THE CREATOR OF HIS OWN DESIGN UNIVERSE THAT IS FAR FROM THE MAINSTREAM, HE IS WORSHIPPED FOR AN AVANT-GARDE APPROACH THAT CHALLENGES THE INDUSTRY&#39;S HISTORICALLY RESTRICTIVE BEAUTY IDEALS. THE RUNWAY HAS BEEN A SPACE FOR OWENS&#39; SARTORIAL RESPONSE TO WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD (CONSIDER HIS SPRING 2018 COLLECTION, &quot;DIRT,&quot; WHICH OWENS CALLS &quot;THE ANSWER TO OUR TEMPORARY CHAOTIC HUMAN CONDITION&quot;) THAT IS AS AESTHETICALLY COMPELLING AS IT IS SOCIALLY IMPACTFUL. NOW, HIS SIGNATURE SUBVERSION IS BEING RECOGNIZED IN A RETROSPECTIVE AT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO. &quot;ALTHOUGH IT&#39;S A PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM, I LIKE HOW IT CLINICALLY APPLIES TO THE SELF-DOUBT, HIGHS, LOWS, AND SELF-DELUSIONS WE ALL FORGIVE OURSELVES FOR EVERY DAY,&quot; OWENS SAYS OF THE EXHIBITION&#39;S TITLE, SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN, WHICH CAPTURES THE 24 YEARS OF INNOVATION, INFLUENCE, AND OBSCURITY THAT DEFINE HIS CAREER. THE RETROSPECTIVE WAS SUGGESTED BY ELEONORA FIORANI, THE TRIENNALE&#39;S FASHION CURATOR, AND RUNS THROUGH MARCH 25. IT FEATURES A SELECTION OF PIECES FROM OWENS&#39; ARCHIVES OF FURNITURE, FASHION, FILM, AND GRAPHICS, AS WELL AS A NEW SCULPTURAL INSTALLATION INSPIRED BY HIS INTEREST IN ARCHITECTURE AND LAND ART. &quot;THE IDEA OF MANIPULATING LAND TO FORGE SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST FOREVER IN A GRAB AT IMMORTALITY ... I LIKE THE HEROISM AND DRIVE AND POIGNANCY IN THAT EFFORT,&quot; HE EXPLAINS. IN THE SAME WAY OWENS HAS ELOQUENTLY PENNED EVERY ONE OF HIS PRESS RELEASES, THE DESIGNER TOOK CONTROL OF HIS OWN NARRATIVE AT THE TRIENNALE. THE OWENS WORLD IS AN INCLUSIVE ONE, WHICH WAS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND A RETROSPECTIVE THAT TOOK THE SPIRIT OF ACCEPTANCE AND KINDNESS AS ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE. SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN EXPLORES OWENS&#39; EVOLUTION AS AN ARTIST, INCLUDING THE INFLUENCES OF STEPHANE MALLARME, PIERO MANZONI, CAROL RAMA, AND MORE. CONSIDERING MUSEUM SHOWS TO BE A SHARED CELEBRATION OF WHAT&#39;S POSSIBLE, HE USED THIS SPACE TO CONTINUE SUGGESTING FLEXIBILITY IN SOCIETY&#39;S STANDARDS OF BEAUTY. THE HOPEFULNESS OF THIS CREATIVE EXPRESSION IS LIKE A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE FOR OWENS, WHO LIKENS MUSEUMS TO HIS OWN KIND OF CHURCH. WHILE THE PARIS-BASED ARTIST IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH FRANCE — HIS FIVE-STORY ATELIER AND MANSION ON THE LEFT BANK, HIS FASCINATION WITH PALAIS DE TOKYO, HIS SERIES OF RUNWAY SHOWS SINCE 2003 — OWENS HAS A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH MILAN. PARIS IS WHERE HE GOES TO BE JUDGED, WHEREAS MILAN HAS PLAYED A DIFFERENT ROLE NOT ONLY IN HIS DESIGN PROCESS, BUT ALSO IN HIS UPBRINGING. &quot;ONCE I MOVED MY MANUFACTURING TO ITALY, IT BECAME THE HOME WHERE I CREATE... MY PARENTS LISTENED TO OPERA A LOT AND LITTLE DID I KNOW MILAN WOULD ONE DAY BE IMPORTANT TO ME.&quot; REFERENCING THE MAIN RAILWAY STATION AS HIS &quot;RATIONALIST, BIBLICAL, DECO FANTASY WRITTEN IN STONE,&quot; OWENS HAS A DEEP, MULTIFACETED CONNECTION TO MILAN AND ITS MANY SOURCES OF INSPIRATION. NOW THE SITE OF HIS FIRST-EVER RETROSPECTIVE, THE CITY HAS NEW MEANING. ALTHOUGH HE IS SELF-CRITICAL BY NATURE, REVISITING HIS OEUVRE FOR THE EXHIBITION HAS BEEN A REVELATION, HE SAYS: &quot;SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO STEP BACK AND ALLOW YOURSELF TO ENJOY A TOTAL PLEASURE.&quot; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

AS OWENS RELEASES HIS COLLABORATION WITH BIRKENSTOCK, WE VISITED HIS PARIS STUDIO FOR A CONVERSATION WITH THIS PECULIAR TALENT. PARIS ON SUNDAY MORNING IS ESPECIALLY LONELY. DRENCHED IN RAIN, I ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF RICK OWENS’ STUDIO. THE NEARBY SQUARE EXUDES THE ELEGANCE UNIQUE TO THE LEFT BANK OF PARIS. BUT THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND. THE DOOR WAS NOT LOCKED, SO I QUIETLY PUSHED IT OPEN AND ENTERED THE DESIGNER&#39;S STUDIO AND HOME. THIS BUILDING, BUILT IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, HAS A GLORIOUS HISTORY (IT WAS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY, AND FORMER PRESIDENT MITTERRAND PREVIOUSLY HAD HIS OFFICE HERE). AFTER OWENS MOVED IN, THE INTERIOR DECORATION WAS COMPLETELY REMOVED, LEAVING THE WALLS BARE. IT FEELS LIKE THE RENOVATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN FINISHED, BUT IN FACT THE PLACE IS ALREADY COMPLETED. A MAVERICK DESIGNER LIVING IN AN ICY ENVIRONMENT, THIS WAS HOW I PREVIOUSLY IMAGINED RICK OWENS. I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT THE FIRST PERSON I MET IN HIS HOME TURNED OUT TO BE AN ASSISTANT HOLDING HIS OWN CHILD. HE TOLD ME THAT THE DESIGNER HAD GONE OUT FOR BREAKFAST WITH HIS MOTHER AND WOULD BE COMING BACK SOON. AT THIS POINT, TWO LIVELY CATS WERE RUNNING AROUND BENEATH MY FEET. THE SUBSEQUENT APPEARANCE OF THE DESIGNER HIMSELF PROVIDED MORE EVIDENCE. THIS LOOK BEHIND THE SCENE SHOWED A DIFFERENT AND RELAXED SIZE TO OWENS. WE WENT UPSTAIRS TO HIS STUDIO. UNLIKE MANY OF HIS PEERS, HE HAS NEVER HIRED A TEAM OF DESIGNERS. “WHY LET OTHER PEOPLE DO WHAT I LIKE DOING MYSELF?&quot; AFTER MOVING TO PARIS IN 2003, OWEN WORKED ON HIS COLLECTIONS BY HIMSELF IN THIS OPEN SPACE BEFORE SENDING HIS DESIGNS TO A FACTORY NEAR VENICE FOR PATTERN MAKING. HE MAY BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT OVER MANY YEARS, HIS DESIGN STYLE HAS NOT REALLY CHANGED. “THIS IS THE BIGGEST TRIUMPH OF MY LIFE. THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS OFTEN FLASHY AND WITHOUT SUBSTANCE. BUT I JUST USED THIS COLOR PALETTE AND RHYTHM IN MY WORK, AND EVERYONE ACCEPTED IT.” OWENS JUST RELEASED HIS 2018 FALL AND WINTER COLLECTION A FEW DAYS AGO, AND THE GARMENT RACKS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CLEARED AWAY. THE SKY OUTSIDE THE WINDOW IS DARK, MAKING THE ROWS OF FLUORESCENT LIGHTS ON THE ROOF APPEAR PARTICULARLY BRIGHT. AFTER ALL, YOU NEED SUCH STRONG LIGHTING IN ORDER TO SEE THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS IN HIS DARK BLACK PALETTE. “TRUST ME, WE HAVE ENDLESS DIFFERENT TYPES OF BLACK.” HOWEVER, IT IS THIS DEDICATION THAT KEEPS HIS DESIGNS SO EXCITING. BIRKENSTOCK’S CEO OLIVER REICHERT HAS PRAISED OWENS AS “A CREATOR WITH SOMETHING TO SAY AND WITH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE.” ACCORDING TO REICHERT, “THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO FASHION, BUT ALSO INCLUDES ARCHITECTURE AND INTERIOR DECORATION. HE HAS BROUGHT A NEW PERSPECTIVE TO OUR COLLABORATION.” RICK OWENS WAS BORN AND RAISED IN A SMALL TOWN IN CALIFORNIA THAT HE ONCE DESCRIBED AS “A PRISON.” FOR COLLEGE, HE WENT TO LOS ANGELES TO STUDY ART. ALTHOUGH HE HADN’T STUDIED FASHION DESIGN SYSTEMATICALLY, IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING GRADUATION, HE WORKED IN A PATTERNS FACTORY FOR CHEAP COPIES OF FAMOUS BRANDS. THROUGH THIS, HE MASTERED A CRAFT THAT MANY DESIGNERS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF. THE DRAPED SKIRTS AND SCULPTED BIKER JACKETS THAT HAVE BECOME THE SIGNATURE OF HIS BRAND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THIS EXPERIENCE. THE SURFACE IS DECEDENT, BUT THE TEXTURE IS STILL LUXURIOUS. EVEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS BRAND IN THE 1990S, OWENS ALWAYS USED THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF LEATHER AND CASHMERE. HE WOULD PUT THESE FABRICS THROUGH THE WASHING MACHINE AND DRYER, SO THEY WOULD NOT APPEAR AS OSTENTATIOUS AS TRADITIONAL LUXURY GOODS WHEN WORN, WHILE CONVEYING A HIGH LEVEL OF QUALITY. AT THE TIME, HIS GIRLFRIEND (NOW WIFE) MICHÈLE LAMY WAS RUNNING A POPULAR LOS ANGELES RESTAURANT AND ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF FAMOUS CUSTOMERS WHILE WEARING OWENS’ DESIGNS. THIS WAS OWENS’ BREAK INTO THE WORLD OF FASHION. MANY DESIGNERS ARE NOT GOOD AT OR DON’T LIKE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN LANGUAGE, BUT OWENS IS NOT LIKE THIS. HIS TYPICAL SENTENCE MIGHT CONTAIN THREE OR FOUR “BUTS,” CONSTANTLY OVERTURNING HIS PREVIOUS REMARKS AND IDEAS. FOR EXAMPLE, “I THINK THAT THESE ACTIONS ARE TOO RHETORICAL, JUST RELYING ON WORDS IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT THERE ARE ALSO OUTSTANDING WRITERS WHO HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD, SO WHAT I JUST SAID IS STUPID.” OBVIOUSLY, ALTHOUGH HE IS FIRM IN HIS DESIGN LANGUAGE, HIS THINKING IS NOT RIGID AT ALL. ON THE CONTRARY, HE IS FAMILIAR WITH HIS OWN LIMITATIONS AND CONTRADICTIONS, AND SENSITIVE TO HIS HYPOCRISY AND VANITY. WE STARTED BY SITTING ON THE SOFA, WITH HIS CHOICE OF JAZZ MUSIC INTERMINGLING WITH THE RAIN OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. FROM CHILDHOOD, HE WORSHIPED THE FILMMAKER CECIL B. DEMILLE, AND GERMAN NUDIST BOOKS FROM THE 1930S. HE MENTIONED THE YOUNG ESTONIAN RAPPER TOMMY CASH WHO HAD JUST COME TO DINNER LAST NIGHT (“YOU MUST LOOK UP HIS VIDEOS!”), AND A FEW THINGS THAT WERE REALTY UNEXPECTED (HE’S A FAN OF AGATHA CHRISTIE). THE CONVERSATION DEVELOPED NATURALLY AS WE SWITCHED BETWEEN TOPICS … YOU INSIST ON THE INDEPENDENT STANCE OF YOUR BRAND. WHEN YOU SEE OTHER BRANDS CONSTANTLY CHANGING DESIGNERS, DO YOU SEE YOURSELF AS AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER?” EVERYONE IN THE INDUSTRY SAYS THAT “I&#39;M NOT A FASHION PERSON.” OF COURSE, I AM, BUT IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FASHION WORLD, AND THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT. TO BE HONEST, I THINK THE MORE CHAOTIC THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS, THE MORE WE CAN EXPRESS OUR OWN VALUES AND GIVE OURSELVES INTEGRITY. I DON&#39;T LIKE TO CRITICIZE ANYTHING. FASHION IS ABOUT TRANSMITTING MESSAGES. MAYBE THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY. BUT IF YOU CHANGE YOUR DESIGNER EVERY FEW SEASONS, WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO COMMUNICATE? MAYBE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY. IF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT PARTICIPATE, THESE THINGS WILL NOT HAPPEN. THEY ARE PART OF THE SHOW. IN THE PAST PEOPLE ALWAYS USED TO ASK ME. “THE FASHION WORLD IS OBSESSED WITH SOME TWISTED DEFINITIONS OF &#39;BEAUTY.’ WHAT SHOULD WE DO?” BUT IF THERE IS NO DEMAND, THEN THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN. BRANDS ARE NOT ABLE TO LEAD PUBLIC OPINION, IN FACT THEY ARE SHAPED BY IT. SO, DO YOU FOLLOW PUBLIC OPINION? MY ADVANTAGE IS THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO SATISFY AS MANY PEOPLE. A BIG BRAND NEEDS TO SERVE MANY PEOPLE. I AM VERY FORTUNATE THAT I ONLY NEED TO PLEASE A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. AND THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE IS ALSO THE LOYAL FAN BASE THAT YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED. BUT THIS IS NOT MY INVENTION. LOOKING BACK AT HISTORY, THIS AESTHETIC HAS ALWAYS HAD ITS FOLLOWERS. I JUST EXTENDED THIS A ESTHETIC NICHE. GIVEN THE RESOURCES OF THE BIG BRANDS, HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT LEADING A FASHION HOUSE? NO, AND IN FACT THEY ARE NOT BANGING DOWN MY DOOR EITHER! BUT THAT IS REALLY A HUGE STAGE, THERE’S A LOT OF PRESSURE, AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS. I DON’T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT OPINIONS. JUST DEALING WITH THE FIVE PEOPLE IN MY COMPANY IS ENOUGH. I WOULD DIE IF I HAD TO FACE A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE EVERY DAY. ALSO, GOING TO ANOTHER BRAND MEANS WORKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE. I COULDN’T DO THAT. HAVE YOU NOT WORKED FOR OTHERS? OF COURSE, I HAVE WORKED AT MCDONALD’S BEFORE. MY LIFE IS ACTUALLY AT A VERY LOW LEVEL. I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING BEFORE. BUT AT THE CURRENT STAGE OF MY LIFE, I WOULDN’T BE COMFORTABLE AS AN EMPLOYEE HAVING TO SEEK THE CONSENT OF OTHERS AND TO COMPROMISE. I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY OWN SPACE AND BE THE KING OF MY OWN LITTLE CORNER. BY PLACING YOURSELF ON THE OUTSIDE, WILL YOU STILL BE AFFECTED BY THE INDUSTRY? THIS IS A BUSINESS AFTER ALL, SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE INDUSTRY WILL STILL AFFECT ME. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I AM NOT AGAINST THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. I JUST SAID THAT I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO COPE WITH IT. AMONG THE BRANDS THAT HAVE THE LOUDEST VOICES AT THE MOMENT, THERE ARE MANY DESIGNERS WHO DO NOT HAVE A BACKGROUND IN APPAREL DESIGN. NOWADAYS EVEN A CREATIVE DIRECTOR CAN ESTABLISH A BRAND. I THINK THIS IS VERY INTERESTING, BECAUSE THIS IS CROSSING BOUNDARIES, AND RESISTING THE CURRENT MOLD IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE NEXT GENERATION SHOULD DO. THEY NEED TO OVERTHROW THE PREVIOUS GENERATION. WHAT GENERATION DO YOU THINK YOU ARE PART OF? HAHA, I AM DEFINITELY FROM THE OLDER GENERATION! I HAVE ALREADY BECOME A PART OF THE SYSTEM, EVEN THOUGH I AM AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE SYSTEM. RIGHT, LAST YEAR YOU WON THE CFDA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. YOUR FIRST SHOW IN 2001 WAS SUPPORTED BY ANNA WINTOUR AND SPONSORED BY VOGUE. RIGHT, SO I SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AN EXTREME SYSTEM INSIDER (LAUGHS) BUT IN YOUR OWN EYES, YOU ARE STILL FIGHTING AND PROVOKING. ARE YOU A SUBVERSIVE? BECAUSE I’M AN INDEPENDENT BRAND, I CAN DO SOME BOLDER THINGS. INDEED, A PART OF ME IS REBELLIOUS AND WANTS TO DESTROY EVERYTHING. AND THIS TYPE OF FEELING SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN STRONGER RECENTLY. I AM AWARE OF CULTURAL REGRESSION. WHERE DID THESE VOICES ON THE INTERNET THAT ARE QUICK TO CRITICIZE AND JUDGE COME FROM? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TOLERANCE AND COMPASSION WE LEARNED ABOUT? I FEEL VERY DISAPPOINTED, I FEEL FRUSTRATED. SO, I NAMED MY SERIES SISYPHUS (A SYNONYM FOR WASTED EFFORT IN ANCIENT GREEK CULTURE). YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE MADE PROGRESS, BUT ACTUALLY YOU ARE STILL MOVING BACKWARDS. YOUR WORK HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED EXTREMELY DARK. IS THIS HOW YOU SEARCH FOR POSITIVE ENERGY, OR ARE YOU REALISTIC ABOUT DARK THINGS? I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS … I DON’T THINK MY DESIGNS ARE PARTICULARLY DARK. INSTEAD, THEY EMBODY A KIND OF REALISM AND PRESENT A CERTAIN IDEA ABOUT BEAUTY. THE WORLD HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE HOMOGENOUS. EVERYONE THINKS MY WORK IS WEIRD, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK: DON&#39;T YOU REMEMBER SURREALISM, CUBISM, DADAISM? I’M NOTHING IN COMPARISON! WHEN I SEE CURRENT MUSICIANS, I WILL THINK, ISN’T THERE ANYTHING MORE INTERESTING? WHERE’S THE NEXT DAVID BOWIE? THINK ABOUT IT, THE INTERNET IS AS POWERFUL AS BOWIE, IT’S AUTHORITATIVE BECAUSE IT HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES IN BOTH AN AESTHETIC AND CULTURAL SENSE. THAT’S IT, THE INTERNET IS THE NEW BOWIE! IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO THINKS A LOT. FOR SURE, MAYBE I THINK TOO MUCH. BUT WILL THIS AFFECT HOW YOU JUDGE DESIGNS AND MAKE YOU MORE HESITANT? NO. IN FACT, INTERVIEWS HAVE BECOME QUITE AWKWARD FOR ME, BECAUSE I DON’T FEEL THAT I’VE CHANGED OVER THE PAST DECADE. I KNOW MY DIRECTION AND WHO I AM. AFTER SO MANY YEARS, THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN ME ALREADY KNOW ABOUT ME. THE PEOPLE WHO DON’T KNOW ME ARE EITHER TOO YOUNG OR AREN’T INTERESTED IN ME AT ALL. SHOULD I REFUSE INTERVIEWS AND MAKE MYSELF MORE MYSTERIOUS? OF COURSE NOT. MANY DESIGNERS ARE NOT GOOD AT EXPRESSING THEMSELVES, BUT YOU ARE VERY ELOQUENT. ALL RIGHT, I ALSO THINK I WILL KEEP ON DOING THEM. THAT WAY I CAN CONTINUE PROMOTING THE IDEAS OF COMPASSION AND TOLERANCE. I AM NOT A SAINT. I ALSO JUDGE OTHERS. IN FACT, I AM VERY HYPOCRITICAL. BUT WE ALL HAVE OUR FAULTS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU WORK HARD TO MAKE UP FOR YOUR FAULTS AND DO NOT LET YOURSELF BE BOUND BY THEM. DO YOU OFTEN RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES? OCCASIONALLY I GO TO NEW YORK TO RECEIVE PRIZES HAHA. BUT I HAVEN’T RETURNED TO LOS ANGELES IN 18 YEARS. I HAVEN’T EVEN VISITED MY STORE THERE. IT’S NOT THAT I DON’T CARE. I HAVE A MODEL OF THE STORE HERE, AND THE FURNITURE INSIDE WAS ALL ARRANGED BY ME. I AM INSPIRED TO DO SOME THINGS FOR THE BRAND, BUT THIS IS LIMITED. WHY ARE YOU SO RELUCTANT TO RETURN HOME? I DON&#39;T KNOW. IT&#39;S WEIRD. I&#39;VE NEVER HAD AN ANSWER. EMOTIONALLY, IT’S A CHALLENGE. MAYBE I DON’T WANT TO GO BACK AND SEE OLD FRIENDS AND TALK ABOUT THE PAST. I DON’T LIKE TO BE SENTIMENTAL. BUT AT THE END OF LAST YEAR YOU PLANNED A RETROSPECTIVE OF YOUR OWN WORK AT THE AT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO. YES, BUT THAT WAS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. I TOLD MY STORY THROUGH MY CONDITION AND EMOTIONS AT THE TIME. THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT RELATED TO WHO I WAS AT THE TIME. I ABANDONED ALL OF THE MISTAKES I MADE, EMPHASIZING ONLY THE BEST THINGS. THIS IS LIKE CREATING A NEW COLLECTION AND SOLIDIFYING MY VISION. I SHOWED MYSELF IN THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT, LIKE A MAGNIFICENT PRETENDER. AND TO SOME EXTENT, WE ARE ALL LIKE THIS. WE ARE ALL REINVENTING OURSELVES. DO YOU READ THE REVIEWS OF YOUR OWN SHOWS, AND WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO BAD REVIEWS? YES, I READ THEM. A LOT OF THE TIME, THEY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WILL ALSO IGNORE THE VOICE OF AUTHORITY WHEN APPROPRIATE. EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT AESTHETIC TASTES. MY PURPOSE IS TO ADVOCATE FOR CHOICES OUTSIDE OF ORDINARY AESTHETICS. SOME PEOPLE WILL HATE THIS. I WELCOME THIS. BECAUSE I ATTACK THEIR NARROW DEFINITION OF “BEAUTY.” OF COURSE, THE CHOICES I OFFER ARE NOT NECESSARILY CORRECT. THEY ARE JUST PROPOSALS. THIS IS MY CONTRIBUTION. WE PREVIOUSLY TALKED ABOUT THE RECOGNITION YOU HAVE RECEIVED IN THE INDUSTRY. WHEN YOU STARTED YOUR CAREER, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A PART OF YOU THAT WAS EAGER TO GET PUBLIC RECOGNITION. THE CREATIVE PROCESS IS VERY NARCISSISTIC. YOU ARE SAYING: WHAT I WANT TO EXPRESS IS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO IT. THIS MAKES ME FEEL ASHAMED. WHERE DOES THIS CONVICTION COME FROM? HOW CAN I FEEL THAT EVERYONE SHOULD LISTEN TO ME? BUT WHENEVER YOU CREATE AND SHOW YOUR WORK TO OTHERS, WHAT YOU ASK FOR IS TO BE RECOGNIZED. THIS IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE. HOW DID YOUR COLLABORATION WITH A BIG COMPANY LIKE BIRKENSTOCK START? ONE DAY THEY SUDDENLY GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME. HAVE YOU BEEN ALWAYS INTERESTED IN THIS BRAND? YES, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD RESPECT FOR THEM. THEY STICK TO THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE AND HAVE BEEN MAKING THE SAME PRODUCT FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. YOU MUST HAVE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE STAYED TRUE AND HONEST FOR SO LONG. I ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCT IMAGE FOLLOWS FROM ITS FUNCTIONALITY. THE FIRST TIME I MET WITH THEM, I SAID THAT BIRKENSTOCK MADE ME THINK OF HEALTH AND AN APPRECIATION OF NATURE, AND OF AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE APPROACH TO HUMAN NATURE. WHAT PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY THIS COLLABORATION? I DECIDED TO CREATE A DESIGN THAT MAKES THE MAXIMUM IMPACT WITH THE MINIMUM DISRUPTION. I STUDIED THEIR DESIGNS AND MADE SOME CHANGES BASED ON THAT. I LENGTHENED THE STRAPS SO THEY WERE ALMOST DRAGGING ON THE GROUND, BECAUSE AFTER EXAMINING MY OWN WORK, I FOUND THAT I WOULD ELONGATE THINGS BEYOND THEIR ORIGINAL SIZE. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MY DESIGN LANGUAGE, MY OWN THINKING SHOULD GO BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES SET BY OTHERS. ASIDE FROM DESIGNING YOUR LA STORE, YOU HAVE ALSO OPENED A POP-UP STORE? I USUALLY LIKE TO MAKE THINGS VERY BIG. SOME PEOPLE ASK ME HOW I DESIGN SUCH A LIMITED SPACE. BUT I’M OBSESSED WITH HOW LE CORBUSIER DEIGNED HIS OWN VACATION HOME IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. IT’S VERY SMALL AND VERY REFINED, JUST LIKE THE CARRIAGES ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. DO YOU LIKE CLOSED SPACES? I HATE THEM. BUT FROM A VISUAL LEVEL, I FEEL THEY ARE VERY WARM. IT’S VERY INTERESTING TO TALK ABOUT THIS. I SAW A PAINTING I REALLY LIKE AT THE PETIT PALAIS ART MUSEUM LAST NIGHT. THE BACKGROUND IS VERY DECORATIVE, THERE ARE GOLDEN BASINS, AND SHINING MIRRORS. IT&#39;S REALLY LUXURIOUS. AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT &quot;I WANT TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD.” IT APPEALS TO ME. BUT I CAN’T LIVE THAT WAY. BUT THESE THINGS THAT ATTRACT YOU WILL NOT BE REFLECTED IN YOUR DESIGNS. SOME ASPECTS WILL BE. IN FACT, MANY THINGS ARE FROM THE INSTALLATION ART PERIOD. I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT KIND OF AESTHETIC, BUT IN A VERY MODEST WAY. IN MY HOME, I MAY PLACE A VASE IN A COMPLETELY WHITE ROOM. THIS STYLE IS VERY MELANCHOLY, IT’S DARK AND FLAMBOYANT. IT’S EXPRESSIVE, BUT IT’S NOT LIKE “ME.” I’M VERY RESTRAINED. THIS IS THE BASIS OF MY ENTIRE AESTHETIC SYSTEM, THE BALANCE BETWEEN CONTROL AND COLLAPSE. I HAVE SURRENDERED TO MY OWN INSTINCTS, IT’S TERRIBLE, DRINKING TOO MUCH, COMPLETELY LOSING CONTROL. THEN YOU CHANGE AND BECOME MORE ORDERLY, FOCUSED, AND IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING. BUT THIS IS A TYPE OF OVERKILL. IN THE END, YOU MUST FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO. IN YOUR OPINION, IS THERE A COMMONALITY BETWEEN YOUR FURNITURE AND CLOTHING DESIGN? THEY ARE BOTH THE CONTINUATION OF THE SAME AESTHETIC. I&#39;M COMPLETELY IN CONTROL OF THE DETAILS. IF I COULD CHANGE THE FACADES OF THE ENTIRE STREET, I WOULD. MY APARTMENT IN CONCORDIA IS ABOVE A BARBER SHOP. THIS IS HARD TO TAKE (LAUGHS) WHY DON’T YOU MOVE? MOVE WHERE? THE APARTMENT IS OPPOSITE TO MY FACTORY, THE LOCATION IS PERFECT. THEN BUY THE BARBER SHOP? HAHA, I’M TRYING HARD! PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS A NEIGHBOR WHO ALWAYS PLAYED MUSIC VERY LOUD DOWNSTAIRS. I BOUGHT THE APARTMENT AND NOW MY STAFF LIVE THERE. THAT IS VERY INTERESTING. WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED DESIGNING, YOU LIVED A NORMAL LIFE. BUT AFTER GAINING SUCCESS, YOU STARTED TO BUY THE SURROUNDING HOUSES, CREATING A VACUUM WITH JUST RICK OWENS. SO HOW DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH REAL LIFE SO YOU WILL NOT BE OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY? I DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH I WILL ABSORB FROM REAL LIFE. MY INSPIRATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE FROM HISTORY. RECENTLY I WAS STUDYING HUMANISTIC ARCHITECTURE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY — THE GOETHEANUM DESIGNED BY RUDOLF STEINER, YOU CAN SAY THAT HE WAS A UTOPIAN ARCHITECT. I AM REFERRING TO HOW PEOPLE LIVED IN HISTORY. WHAT THEY WANTED ON A BASIC LEVEL, AND NOT WANT THEY WANT THIS YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, I DO NOT SIT IN A LUXURY CAR EVERY DAY. I GO TO THE GYM BY SUBWAY, AND I GO TO MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES. IT LOOKS LIKE I’M WITHDRAWING FROM SOCIETY, BUT I&#39;M NOT. I’M INVESTIGATING. I WANT TO LEARN. DO YOU DESIGN MEN&#39;S AND WOMEN&#39;S CLOTHING DIFFERENTLY? I DON’T KNOW. BUT I DON’T ASSUME THAT THE MEN I DESIGN FOR ARE LIKE ME, IT’S THE SAME FOR WOMEN’S CLOTHING. YOU DON&#39;T THINK ABOUT WHAT WOMEN WANT TO WEAR? NO, IF I START THINKING ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT, I WILL LOSE MY DIRECTION. AFTER ALL, I CAN NEVER IMAGINE WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE A WOMAN. FOR ME, THEY ARE ALWAYS A SURPRISE. AT SOME MAGICAL MOMENT, YOU INTUITIVELY DO SOMETHING, AND IT HITS PEOPLE, SO THE RESPONSE WILL BE GOOD. NOT EVERY TIME, BUT I MANAGED TO DO IT SEVERAL TIMES. THIS OF COURSE CANNOT BE PREDICTED. IF WE COULD PREDICT IT, WE’D ALL BE BILLIONAIRES (LAUGHS). HOW MUCH DO YOU PARTICIPATE IN THE BRAND&#39;S BUSINESS? FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSED ON PRODUCTION. IT’S NOT A LOAD OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STUDIO PLAYING AT BEING CREATIVE. THEY REALLY GO THE FACTORY AND WORK TOGETHER WITH THE FACTORY WORKERS ON CREATING THINGS. TO TELL THE TRUTH, SOMETIMES IT MAKES ME WORRY. WILL WE DECIDE THAT THE PRODUCTION IS TOO COMPLICATED AND CHANGE THE DESIGN, SACRIFICING CREATIVITY. BUT THINKING THE OTHER WAY AROUND, PERHAPS THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE? MY STRENGTH IS THAT I AM ABLE TO BALANCE CREATIVITY AND WEARABILITY. HOWEVER, I STILL WANT TO HAVE A ROOM THAT IS ONLY ABOUT CREATIVITY, MY CRAZIEST DREAMS. FOR YOU, ISN&#39;T THAT THE DESIGNS YOU SHOW ON THE CATWALK? TO SOME EXTENT, BUT I ALSO MAKE THOSE DESIGNS, AND EVERY DESIGN HAS A PRICE TAG. I DON’T DENY THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESS, THE PRICE WILL BE RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. BUT I DON’T WANT TO SHOW A DESIGN ON THE CATWALK AND THEN SAY IT’S NOT FOR SALE, YOU CAN’T HAVE IT. I DON’T LIKE THAT. ARE YOU AFRAID THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR CREATIVITY? ANY CREATIVE PERSON DOES. MY FATHER ONCE ASKED ME THE SAME THING. I SAID THAT I&#39;M NOT SURE, BUT I THINK I HAVE ENOUGH IDEAS IN MY HEAD FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. WHEN I’M OPTIMISTIC, I THINK OF ALL THESE IDEAS, AND I JUST NEED TO CLEAR MY HEAD. WHEN I AM PESSIMISTIC, I THINK IT WILL GET MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT. SO, I DON&#39;T KNOW. LET’S WAIT AND SEE. IS YOUR WORK OPTIMISTIC? MY WORK IS OPTIMISTIC. ANY CREATIVE ACT IS, BECAUSE IT WAS BORN OF HOPE, AND IT WANTS TO COMMUNICATE AND ENVISAGE A FUTURE. I DON&#39;T KNOW EVERYTHING. MAYBE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE EVIL IN THE WORLD. THIS WILL HELP YOU CREATE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL. AS WE JUST SAID, YOU CANNOT CREATE IN A VACUUM. YOU NEED TO COLLIDE WITH SOMETHING. YOU NEED TO HAVE BOTH BAD AND GOOD. I THINK I CAN ACCEPT THAT THE WORLD IS LIKE THIS. I AM NOT AN IDEALIST. I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO BE HAPPY. WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE WHATEVER WE HAVE.

RICK OWENS HAS NEVER COMPROMISED ON HIS UNIQUE STYLE, NOR HAD ANY DOUBTS. WE WONDERED WHAT LAY BEHIND SUCH LOYALTY TO SELF. A MEETING WITH A MAN AT PEACE. EVER SINCE HIS 1994 LOS ANGELES DEBUT, RICK OWENS HAS CONSISTENTLY ASSERTED HIS ATTACHMENT TO HIS OWN VISION OF FASHION AND OF LIFE ITSELF, TO HIS PERSONAL AESTHETIC, AND TO WHAT CONSTITUTES IT, DEEP DOWN. YOU&#39;D BE HARD PUT TO FIND A DESIGNER WHO HAS PLOUGHED SUCH A CONSISTENT, SUBSTANTIAL FURROW IN HIS WORK, AND WHO HAS MANAGED TO REMAIN AT THE CUSP OF CONTEMPORANEITY FOR OVER TWO DECADES WITHOUT EVER COMPROMISING. OWENS IS A FREE SPIRIT WHO IS GENEROUS ENOUGH TO WANT TO PASS THAT FREEDOM ON TO US, TO INSPIRE US TO CLAIM OUR INDIVIDUALITY AND FREE US FROM THE MOST CONFORMIST CONVENTIONS SO OFTEN PROJECTED BY FASHION. WITH &quot;DIRT&quot;, HIS SIS 2018 COLLECTION, HIS TOPS ARE DECORATED WITH LACQUERED COTTON DRAPING INSPIRED BY THE PAINTING OF ARTIST STEVEN PARRINO THAT ADORNS THE WALLS OF HIS HOME, WITH POCKETS SUFFICIENTLY CAPACIOUS TO CARRY WHAT YOU NEED TO SURVIVE IN HOSTILE TERRITORY, NOT FORGETTING A TOUCH OF GLAM, AS IN THE BOTTOMS OF HIS HIGH-WAISTED TROUSERS, SWEEPING THE FLOOR LIKE THE TRAINS OF ART DECO EVENING GOWNS. WHEN WE MET HIM IN HIS REDOUBT IN THE SEVENTH ARRONDISSMENT IN PARIS, OR MORE PRECISELY ON THE FIRST FLOOR, IN THE VAST, GENTLY BRUTALIST MINIMALIST SPACE HE USES AS HIS STUDIO, RICK OWENS IS WEARING HIS SIGNATURE UNIFORM OF A SCOOP-NECK T-SHIRT, BAGGY BERMUDA SHORTS, AND BLACK HI-TOP TRAINERS. IT&#39;S HIS STYLE POLICY TO SHOW THE WORLD THE RELAXED PLACIDITY OF SOME­ONE WHO&#39;S HAPPY IN HIS SKIN, ALWAYS WARM, FUNNY, AND INCISIVE, WITH THAT UNFLAPPABLE KINDNESS THAT SEEKS TO GIVE OTHERS THE MEANS TO BE THEMSELVES. VOGUE HOMMES YOUR CLOTHES AND YOUR CATWALK SHOWS READ LIKE A MANIFESTO FOR MORE INDIVIDUALITY AND FREEDOM. DON&#39;T YOU FIND THAT OUR SOCIETY IS STILL HIGHLY CONFORMIST WHEN IT COMES TO PERSONAL STYLE AND APPEARANCE? RICK OWENS I THINK THAT SOCIETY IS STILL VERY CONFORMIST ON A LOT OF OTHER REGISTERS, NOT JUST THE WAY WE DRESS OURSELVES. IN AMERICA, JUST LOOK AT THE POLICIES TOWARDS TRANS PEOPLE, AT THE WAY MEN ABUSE THEIR POWER. AND THEN WE HAVE TRUMP FOR A PRESIDENT. I THINK A LOT ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. &quot;DIRT&quot;, MY S/S 18 MEN&#39;S COLLECTION, WAS DRIVEN BY ANGER. I WAS HORRIFIED BY THE FACT THAT CYCLES OF CONFORMISM, OPPRESSION, AND CONSERVATISM KEEP COMING BACK. AFTER EVERYTHING WE&#39;VE BEEN THROUGH, HISTORICALLY, AND AFTER ALL THAT RATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT WHAT FREEDOM MEANS, HERE WE ARE, BACK IN AN ALARMING SOCIETAL SITUATION. HERE&#39;S A SIMPLE EXAMPLE: I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE HOW RAPIDLY PEOPLE&#39;S COMMENTS ON THE INTERNET BECAME VERY AGGRESSIVE AND MALICIOUS, THANKS TO THE ANONYMITY YOU ENJOY WITH THE WEB. IS IT BECAUSE, ON THE NET, YOU CAN SEE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING, AND THAT EVERYONE TODAY FEELS ENTITLED TO DEMAND THE SAME THING? YET OUR TIMES ARE FANTASTIC! THE INTERNET DELIVERS SO MUCH INFORMATION! WE&#39;VE NEVER HAD SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING AS WE HAVE TODAY — AND LEARNING IS THE BEST THING GOING, BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU POWER. THEN AGAIN, AIDS IS UNDER CONTROL, WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE CRUSADES, TUBERCULOSIS, SYPHILIS, OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT KILLED PEOPLE BACK IN THE DAY. YET PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED AND BECOME FULL OF HATE. THEIR INSTINCTS ARE VERY CRUDE. VOGUE HOMMES HAVE YOU NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF IMPULSE YOURSELF? RICK OWENS MY RESPONSE TO ALL THAT WAS ANGER, WHICH IS NO BETTER. I&#39;M SOMEONE WHO WORKED HARD TO CHANGE HIMSELF, TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON AND, DESPITE THAT, I STILL FIND IT HARD TO CONTAIN MY ANGER, SO HOW COULD I JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S? AND YET I DO JUDGE THEM, EVEN THOUGH I HATE JUDGMENTAL PEOPLE: I JUDGE THE OTHERS WHO JUDGE, AND THEN I JUDGE MYSELF JUDGING THE OTHERS BECAUSE THEY JUDGE. THERE&#39;S NO END TO IT AND IT DEPRESSES ME. BUT I CAME TO REALIZE THAT THOSE CRUDE ATTITUDES ARE PART OF LIFE AND OF ME, AND I HAVEN&#39;T MANAGED, DESPITE ALL MY EFFORTS, TO GET RID OF THEM. I&#39;M EASILY IRRITABLE, I LOSE PATIENCE, I THINK THAT MY OPINION IS BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S. RECENTLY I WENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF EXISTENTIAL UPHEAVAL. VOGUE HOMMES DO YOU GET UPSET BY OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S JUDGEMENT? RICK OWENS NO, I&#39;M VERY AGGRESSIVE. EVERYTHING I DO HINGES REALLY ON THE FACT OF QUESTIONING THE RULES: WHY DO A WOMAN&#39;S BREASTS HAVE TO BE PUSHED UP AND HER WAIST EMPHASIZED? WHY DO WE HAVE TO CONFORM TO THESE FEMININE STEREOTYPES WHEN THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS OF BEAUTY? WHY DO WE STILL HAVE TO CONFORM TO THAT NARROW DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES &quot;PRETTY&quot;? THAT ACTUALLY ENERGIZES ME, BECAUSE IT MAKES ME WANT TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVES, TO SHOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS, AND THAT WE AREN&#39;T OBLIGED TO CONFORM TO THOSE STANDARD, INFANTILE RULES. AS FOR CRITICISM, IF THERE IS ANY, I IGNORE IT BECAUSE I DON&#39;T ACCEPT THE AESTHETIC AUTHORITY OF PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZE ME. THAT SOUNDS VERY IMPERIOUS [LAUGHS) BUT THE REASON I AM WHAT I AM IS BECAUSE I CAME IN FOR A LOT OF CRITICISM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. VOGUE HOMMES WHEN YOU STARTED OUT AS A DESIGNER? RICK OWENS WHEN I BECAME A DESIGNER, I ALREADY KNEW WHAT MY AESTHETIC WAS, AND I WAS SURE OF ITS VALUE. I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED MY AESTHETIC. NO, I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I WAS THIS FAIRLY EFFEMINATE KID IN SMALL TOWN CALIFORNIA, SO IT WAS PRETTY BRUTAL. I WAS VERY DELICATE AND SENSITIVE, SO I HAD TO LEARN TO TOUGHEN UP. THAT SAID, EVEN IF! WAS SENSITIVE, I STILL ALSO FELT A LOT OF ANGER. AND ANGER TRANSFORMS INTO POWER, IT&#39;S AN EXCELLENT DRIVER. THAT&#39;S THE VIRTUE OF AGGRESSIVENESS. BUT I&#39;M VERY TORN: AGGRESSIVENESS IS SOMETHING I STRONGLY DISAPPROVE OF. I LIKE TO SETTLE THINGS ELEGANTLY, GENTLY. BUT I WOULDN&#39;T BE WHERE I AM NOW WITHOUT THAT VERY PRIMAL ANGER. VOGUE HOMMES SO, THERE&#39;S A PRICE TO PAY TO BECOME YOURSELF AND REMAIN TRUE TO YOURSELF? RICK OWENS I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I HAD A PRICE TO PAY. THESE DAYS, I FEEL GOOD. I&#39;VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE, AND I&#39;VE ALWAYS BEEN TRUE TO MYSELF. I&#39;VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING I DIDN&#39;T BELIEVE IN. I TRY TO INJECT VALUES LIKE NICENESS INTO WHAT I DO. TO USE THE CATWALK SHOWS AS A PLATFORM TO TALK ABOUT POSITIVE VALUES. I&#39;M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT I&#39;M PROUD OF MYSELF: THAT WOULD BE TOO ARROGANT. BUT I FEEL THAT IF I WERE TO DIE TOMORROW, I WOULD HAVE LED AS HONORABLE A LIFE AS POSSIBLE. VOGUE HOMMES WHAT&#39;S ADMIRABLE IS YOUR COHERENCE AND CONSISTENCY... RICK OWENS I DON&#39;T KNOW ABOUT ITS BEING ADMIRABLE, BUT I DO WONDER HOW MUCH LONGER IT CAN LAST. WE&#39;VE SEEN DESIGNERS WHO WERE VERY POWERFUL AND RELEVANT AT ONE TIME AND WE&#39;VE SEEN THEM GETTING STUCK IN A RUT AND OVERTAKEN. I&#39;M PETRIFIED BY THE IDEA THAT THIS MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME BECAUSE IT MUST BE VERY PAINFUL. SO, I&#39;M VERY SELF-CRITICAL, VERY HARD ON MYSELF, I&#39;M VERY AWARE THAT I&#39;M STILL LEARNING. BUT EACH NEW GENERATION KICKS BACK AT THE PREVIOUS ONE, AS I DID WITH THE GENERATION BEFORE ME. AND THAT STIMULATES ME AND ATTRACTS ME, TOO. VOGUE HOMMES DID YOU KNOW WHO YOU WERE WHEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG? RICK OWENS NOT AT ALL! WHEN I WAS TWENTY, I WAS JUST THIS ALCOHOLIC JERK, ARROGANT, PEDANTIC, AND AGGRESSIVE. I JUST LEARNED. VOGUE HOMMES WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE? WAS THERE SOME KIND OF TRIGGER? RICK OWENS NO. YOU GET OLDER AND YOU LEARN. IT&#39;S LIKE DRIVING, WHEN YOU LEARN TO CHANGE GEARS. AT THE START, YOU DO IT WITH VERY STIFF MOVEMENTS, BUT THE MORE YOU DRIVE, THE SMOOTHER YOUR MOVEMENTS. WHEN I WAS TWENTY, MY AMBITION AND AGGRESSIVENESS WERE BADLY CHANNELED. I HAD TO LEARN TO CHANNEL THEM IN ANOTHER DIRECTION, BECAUSE IT LED TO SOME PRETTY NASTY STUFF. NOT DIABOLICAL, THOUGH — I NEVER KILLED ANYONE! VOGUE HOMMES YOU DIDN’T GO EASY ON YOURSELF? RICK OWENS NOR ON ANYONE ELSE! I WAS VERY BITCHY. A REAL JERK! MICHELE [LAMY, HIS WIFE] OFTEN REMINDS ME OF IT. SHE&#39;S GOT A VERY GOOD MEMORY AND NEVER MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY [LAUGHS]. VOGUE HOMMES WAS IT YOUR MEETING WITH MICHELE THAT HELPED YOU TO CHANGE, TO BECOME YOURSELF AND STAY THAT WAY? RICK OWENS FOR STARTERS, IT WAS MICHELE WHO GOT ME TO THE GYM, AND THAT PROBABLY HELPED ME A LOT. IT WAS A WAY OF CHANNELING MY AGGRESSIVENESS AND IT MADE MY PHYSICALLY MORE AT EASE WITH MYSELF. WHEN YOU FEEL THAT YOU&#39;RE LOOKING BETTER, IT&#39;S VERY MOTIVATING. AND LOOKING AFTER YOURSELF, DOING SOMETHING POSITIVE FOR YOURSELF, IS DEEPLY SATISFYING. AND THEN I STOPPED DRINKING. IT WAS STARTING TO BELIEVE IN KINDNESS THAT MADE ME STOP DRINKING AND BEHAVING LIKE A JERK. VOGUE HOMMES IN YOUR NEW S/S 18 &quot;DIRT&quot; COLLECTION, THERE&#39;S A LOT OF DRAPING, WHERE MEN CAN CARRY STUFF, CHILDREN. YOUR POCKETS ARE BIG ENOUGH &quot;TO FIT A SANDWICH&quot;, AS YOU WROTE. ARE YOU TRYING TO HELP MEN TO SURVIVE? RICK OWENS IT&#39;S EASY TO INTERPRET MY MENSWEAR COLLECTIONS AS A POST-APOCALYPSE THING, BECAUSE MY SHOWS ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE. BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME MORE IS TO CHANGE THE BODY&#39;S PROPORTIONS BY CREATING EXTENSIONS FOR IT, BY MAKING THE CLOTHES GO WHERE THEY&#39;RE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO. IN SHORT, I WANTED TO DEFORM THE HUMAN BODY. THE BODY&#39;S APPEARANCE AND WHAT MAKES IT ATTRACTIVE IS STILL SO STEREOTYPED TODAY. WHEREAS WE&#39;RE MUCH SEXIER WHEN WE&#39;RE NOT TRYING TO BE SEXY, OR EVEN WHEN WE&#39;RE TRYING TO DO THE OPPOSITE. I THINK THAT IN MY CASE, IT HAS TO DO WITH THE GYM. AFTER I STARTED GOING TO THE GYM, THE MORE MY BODY CHANGED, THE LESS CLOTHES WERE IMPORTANT FOR ME. AND THEN, IF YOU&#39;RE GETTING ENOUGH SEX IN LIFE, WHY DO YOU NEED TO SHOW CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BODY IN CERTAIN WAYS? IN A NUTSHELL, MY FASHIONS HAVE LESS TO DO WITH PROTECTION THAN WITH ATTACK. VOGUE HOMMES WHICH ATTITUDE SHOULD YOU HAVE TOWARDS THE WORLD: FIGHT OR ADAPT? RICK OWENS BOTH. THERE ARE NICE WAYS TO FIGHT. AND ADAPTING IS NO BAD THING. POLITENESS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT&#39;S BETTER THAN AGGRESSIVENESS. THAT&#39;S WHY I STOPPED WEARING BLACK FOR A WHILE IN FAVOR OF THIS TYPE OF GREY THAT I OFTEN PUT IN MY COLLECTIONS, BECAUSE IT&#39;S A CALM, SOFT COLOR. THEN I BEGAN TO BE ATTRACTED BY BLACK AGAIN. PERHAPS BECAUSE I FELT I WAS STRONGER, AND OLDER. THERE&#39;S A CERTAIN SHARPNESS WITH BLACK, SOMETHING IMPECCABLE. TO SEE A PIECE OF PERFECTLY CUT CLOTHING, WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY CHAOTIC OR DIRTY THINGS IN THE WORLD, BRINGS ME A SORT OF RELIEF. A PRIEST IN A FINE BLACK SUIT EXUDES A SENSE OF AUTHORITY, NOBILITY, OF FORMALITY. PEOPLE WHO WEAR A BLACK UNIFORM, SUCH AS JUDGES, NUNS, AND POLICEMEN, ARE OFTEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS. SO, I STARTED TO WEAR BLACK AGAIN AND TO BRING IT BACK INTO MY COLLECTIONS TO COMBAT THE CHAOS OF THE WORLD. I DON&#39;T WANT TO DESIGN COLLECTIONS THAT LOOK LIKE THE INSIDE OF A SUPERMARKET OR A SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL&#39;S WARDROBE. VOGUE HOMMES WHY IS THE COLLECTION CALLED &quot;DIRT&quot;? RICK OWENS BECAUSE WE ALL DIRTY OURSELVES. IT&#39;S CHEAP, PRIMITIVE, SIMPLISTIC. IT ALSO SUGGESTS TRASH, AND I&#39;VE ALWAYS LIKED HAVING A BIT OF TRASH IN MY LIFE. I ALSO LIKE THE IDEA OF DEBAUCHERY, BECAUSE THERE&#39;S A CERTAIN HONESTY IN IT. I LIKE ARTIFICE, AND I CELEBRATE IT A LOT, BUT I ALSO LIKE WHAT&#39;S TRUE, WHAT&#39;S REAL, WHEN I SAY ARTIFICE, I&#39;M THINKING OF KABUKI OR IKEBANA. I&#39;M THINKING PATISSERIE, THAT KIND OF EXQUISITE ARTIFICE, BUT BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR, I LIKE IT WHEN THE EXQUISITE AND THE GROTESQUE GO TOGETHER. HAVING A SENSE OF HUMOR IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEGANT THINGS IN THE WORLD. PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR REALLY BORE ME. THEY TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUSLY, WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO MAKE FUN OF THEMSELVES, AND IT&#39;S VERY HEALTHY TO BE ABLE TO LAUGH AT YOURSELF. LAUGHING AT YOURSELF IS ALSO A WAY OF NOT PRETENDING THAT YOU ARE SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE PERSON YOU ARE. AND THAT PUTS OTHER PEOPLE AT EASE, IT&#39;S GENEROUS. LETTING OTHER PEOPLE BE WHO THEY ARE, GIVING THEM THE SPACE TO DO THAT, IS VERY IMPORTANT. VOGUE HOMMES THERE&#39;S SOMETHING MYSTICAL, RELIGIOUS IN YOUR APPROACH TO EXISTENCE, ISN&#39;T THERE? RICK OWENS I&#39;M NOT RELIGIOUS, BUT WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WENT TO A CATHOLIC SCHOOL. THE BIBLE AND CATHOLIC TEACHINGS WERE MY FIRST EXAMPLES OF EXOTICISM. THERE&#39;S THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE WEARING DRESSES IN THE DAYTIME, TALKING ABOUT SPIRITUAL THINGS. IT WAS REALLY EXALTING FOR A CHILD MAROONED IN A SMALL TOWN AND WHO ALWAYS WANTED THINGS TO BE &quot;MORE&quot;. LATER, I STARTED WATCHING CECIL B. DEMILLE&#39;S BIBLICAL EPICS. HIS FILMS MIGHT MORALIZE AND CONDEMN THE SINNER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE SPENT A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME SHOWING SINNERS SINNING. SO, THEY WERE FANTASTIC TO WATCH! IT&#39;S A BIT LIKE WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW: YOU HAVE THE NEW YORK TIMES MORALIZING ABOUT THESE SEXUAL HARASSMENT STORIES WHILE DESCRIBING THEM AT GREAT LENGTH AND IN THE MOST GORY DETAIL. IT&#39;S HORRIFYING TO SEE SUCH A SERIOUS NEWSPAPER BECOMING SO TRASHY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I READ ALL THOSE ARTICLES WITHOUT SKIPPING A LINE, BECAUSE I&#39;M JUST THE SAME AS THEM, A MORALIZER WHO LOVES SIN. VOGUE HOMMES DO YOU &quot;SIN&quot; OFTEN? RICK OWENS I LOVE SIN. I WANT TO SIN. I HAVE SINNED IN THE PAST AND I LOVED IT. BUT THERE ARE LIMITS. YOU ALSO HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF HOW FAR SIN AFFECTS OTHER PEOPLE. VOGUE HOMMES ARE WE SEEING A RETURN TO PURITANISM? RICK OWENS YES, AND IT&#39;S ALL A BIT TOO MUCH FOR ME. THAT SAID, WE NEED TO HAVE LIMITS. THE FACT THAT MY PARENTS WERE STRICT MADE ME STRONGER AND REALISTIC ABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS. THE WORLD NEEDS CONFLICT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO FIGHT AGAINST. IF MY PARENTS HAD BROUGHT ME UP WITHOUT FEAR OR SHAME, WOULD I HAVE THIS SENSE OF URGENCY AND THIS RAGE TO DO WHAT I WANT&#39;? I DON&#39;T THINK SO. BUT EVEN IF TODAY, THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE MEANS THAT I HAVE THE FREEDOM NOT TO HAVE ANY LIMITS, I&#39;M VERY DISCIPLINED AND I WANT TO PUSH BACK AS MANY LIMITS AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE CLOTHES I MAKE. I RESPECT CERTAIN VALUES, BUT NOT CERTAIN OTHERS THAT KILL FREEDOM, SO I DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO COMBAT THEM. VOGUE HOMMES FACED WITH A CHOICE OF A DECISION TO TAKE, DO YOU RELY ON YOUR INSTINCT OR YOUR REASON? RICK OWENS I&#39;M NOT REALLY SPONTANEOUS, NOT AT ALL IMPULSIVE. I&#39;M MUCH MORE ANALYTICAL AND CALCULATING THAN INSTINCTIVE. I LIKE TO EXAMINE ALL THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN A SITUATION BEFORE TAKING A DECISION. I LIKE TO THINK OF EVERYTHING BEFORE I DO SOMETHING. VOGUE HOMMES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF &quot;LETTING GO&quot;? RICK OWENS IT&#39;S ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT. IN MY CASE, I&#39;M CAREFUL NOT TO PUSH ASIDE WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING TODAY BY TELLING MYSELF THAT WHAT I USED TO DO WAS BETTER. I&#39;M WAITING FOR A NEW GENERATION TO COME ALONG AND SHOCK ME.

AS IS THE APARTMENT HE HAS BUILT FOR HIMSELF HERE, JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM WHERE MR THOMAS MANN’S GUSTAV VON ASCHENBACH HAD HIS DEATH IN VENICE. “THOUGH I REALLY HOPE THIS DOESN’T END WITH ME KEELING OVER ON THE BEACH IN FULL MAKE UP, HAIR DYE RUNNING DOWN MY FACE,” MR OWENS SAYS, DEADPAN AND DELIGHTED. MR OWENS HAS BEEN COMING TO VENICE REGULARLY SINCE HE MOVED HIS MANUFACTURING TO CONCORDIA, ITALY, MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. HE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN TO ACQUIRE A HOUSE IN BOLOGNA OR MODENA, BOTH CLOSER TO HIS FACTORY BUT HE HAS LONG BEEN ENCHANTED BY VENICE, BECAUSE, HE SAYS, “IT’S THE MOST IMPRACTICAL, MAGICAL, LEGENDARY CITY EVER”. VENICE, THE CAPITAL OF OPULENCE AND LICENSE, HAS OF COURSE ALWAYS DRAWN THE DECADENTS, THE GRANDIOSE, FROM LORD BYRON ON DOWN. AND THE TINY CITY-EMPIRE THAT INVENTED THE TERMS QUARANTINE (FROM QUARANTINA, FOR THE 40 DAYS VENETIANS MADE THEIR VISITORS WAIT OFF SHORE SO AS TO WARD OFF POTENTIAL BRINGERS OF PLAGUE), TURNS OUT TO BE AN IDEAL SPOT TO SET YOURSELF IN A HERMITAGE FROM FASHION AS WELL. FOR A WHILE, MR OWENS AND HIS WIFE MS MICHÈLE LAMY, BOTH DEVOTED SUN-WORSHIPERS, WERE CONTENT TO STAY FOR LONG STRETCHES AT THE LIDO’S EXCELSIOR HOTEL, MINGLING WITH BOTH THE WELL-HEELED HOLIDAYMAKERS AND THE GLAMOROUS GHOSTS OF THE CAFE SOCIETY WHO ANIMATE THE PLACE. “NIJINSKY USED TO DANCE ON THIS BEACH,” MR OWENS SAYS, OVER LUNCH ON THE EXCELSIOR TERRACE. “DIAGHILEV DIED IN THIS HOTEL. I MEAN, FOR EVERYBODY IN THE 1920S AND 1930S, THE PERIODS THAT I WAS MOST INTERESTED IN, THIS WAS THE MOST LEGENDARY SPOT ON THE PLANET. AND IT STILL HAS THAT ALLURE AND THAT HISTORY. BUT NOT ONLY THAT, THE WATER IS VERY PLACID HERE, I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THE WHOLE CABANA/HOTEL VIBE. I LIKE HAVING TO GET AROUND ON BOATS, AND I LIKE THAT THE OLYMPICS OF THE ART WORLD, THE BIENNALE, IS FIVE MINUTES AWAY.” THE SCALE OF THE VILLAGE HERE, AND THE NEIGHBOURLINESS OF THE NATIVES, RECALL HIS HOMETOWN OF PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, HE SAYS. “AND I LOVE THAT THE LIDO IS SO QUIET. THERE CAN BE A LITTLE TINGE OF MELANCHOLY TO THIS PLACE, WHICH I LOVE, TOO. THERE AREN’T DISTRACTIONS – THERE AREN&#39;T NIGHT CLUBS AND DRUGS AND PRETTY PEOPLE – SO THAT KEEPS ME IN A SAFE SPACE.” IN 2014, WHILE THEIR PARIS HOME WAS IN THE MIDST OF RENOVATIONS, MR OWENS FELT LIKE IT WAS TIME TO MAKE HIS RESIDENCE IN VENICE SAFER STILL, AND A LITTLE MORE PERMANENT. AFTER FLIRTING WITH A LEASE ON THE COPPER-TOPPED DOME SUITE OF THE EXCELSIOR, HE OPTED FOR A PENTHOUSE APARTMENT WITH WIDE WRAPAROUND TERRACES IN A CONDOMINIUM BUILDING A FEW BLOCKS AWAY. TO MS LAMY’S DISMAY, MR OWENS TORE UP THE 1970S TURQUOISE TILE FLOOR TO LAY DOWN SHEETS OF TRAVERTINE MARBLE – WALL-TO-WALL MARBLE, FLOOR-TO-CEILING MARBLE – SAVE FOR THE WALLS IN THE GYM WHICH ARE FLOOR-TO-CEILING MIRROR. THE RESULTING AESTHETIC MS LAMY TEASINGLY CALLED “SUPERMAN’S CASTLE,” ALLOWING FOR REFERENCES TO BOTH MR CHRISTOPHER REEVE AND MR FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE. THE 1930S ITALIAN FUTURIST BUSTS OF MR BENITO MUSSOLINI, BY THAYAHT AND MR RENATO BERTELLI, ARE, TOO, NOT ENTIRELY TO HER LIKING. “THE WHOLE FASCIST [ASSOCIATION] OF THE HEADS REALLY DISTURBS HER,” MR OWENS SAYS. “AND MY EXPLANATION IS THAT I’VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF FASCINATED BY THAT WHOLE MOVEMENT BECAUSE, AT THE BEGINNING, THE ITALIAN FUTURIST MOVEMENT WAS UTOPIAN. AND, IN ANY KIND OF ANY UTOPIAN MOVEMENT, THE INTENTIONS ARE ALWAYS HONORABLE AT THE BEGINNING, AND THEN THEY DEGENERATE. BUT THERE&#39;S SOMETHING VERY POIGNANT TO ME ABOUT LOOKING AT HEADS LIKE THAT. IT’S THE STORY OF LIFE, OF ASPIRATION, AND FAILURE AND RENEWAL. I THINK OF THEM AS SKULLS, MEMENTO MORI, TO REMIND YOU THAT ALL IS VANITY.” ALL IS CERTAINLY AND SELF-CONSCIOUSLY VANITY IN MR OWENS’S GYM, WHERE THE DOUBLE-SIDED SWINGING DOORS OF MIRRORS MAKE FOR A LABYRINTHINE FUNHOUSE EFFECT, “LIKE AN ACID FLASHBACK,” HE SAYS GLEEFULLY, “OPENING PORTALS INTO OTHER WORLDS.” IF, AS HE SUGGESTED IN AN INTERVIEW AFTER HIS MOST RECENT MENSWEAR SHOW IN JUNE, HE HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED BY ANY OBSTACLES IN IMPLEMENTING HIS VISION, OUT THERE, UPON THE WORLD, IN HERE, AND IN REGARDS TO HIS BODY, MR OWENS IS IN COMPLETE CONTROL. AT 56, HE IS IN THE BEST SHAPE OF HIS LIFE – SUPERHUMANLY SO, TO THE POINT THAT HE CALLS TO MIND THE EMBLEMATIC 6FT MAN WHO, ACCORDING TO MR JOHN BERGER, FUNCTIONED AS “MODULAR AND MEASURE” FOR ALL OF LE CORBUSIER’S ARCHITECTURE. LE CORBUSIER MADE A MURAL OF THIS MAN OUTSIDE HIS OWN SLIGHTLY SEVERE SEASIDE RETREAT, LE CABANON, NEAR WHERE THE ARCHITECT IS BURIED. AND AS MR OWENS SAYS, “I HAVE TWO REFERENCES THAT I&#39;VE ALWAYS LOOKED AT ARCHITECTURALLY: JEAN-MICHEL FRANK’S INTERIORS AND LE CORBUSIER’S LE CABANON.” AND THE AESTHETIC SIMILARITIES DON’T END THERE. IN HIS RECENT RETROSPECTIVE, AT THE MILANO TRIENNALE LAST WINTER, FOR WHICH HE CONSTRUCTED A GIANT WORM-Y PAPIER-MÂCHÉ-LIKE SCULPTURE MADE IN PART OF SAND FROM THE LIDO, MR OWENS SAID THAT HE TOO PLANS TO STAY BY THE SEA HERE FOR ETERNITY, AT A CEMETERY A FEW BLOCKS UP THE ROAD. MR OWENS HAS CONSTRUCTED HIS APARTMENT – AND DAILY REGIMEN – SPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT HIS OWN PURPOSEFUL PURSUIT. “THERE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ANY SURPRISES,” HE SAYS. “I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I’M GOING TO DO EVERY DAY. I GET UP AT 8.00AM, AND I HAVE COFFEE IN BED WITH A COMPUTER. I GO TO THE BEACH, ORDER A DOUBLE ESPRESSO, AND DO MY READING, ANSWER EMAILS FROM THE FACTORY. I COME HERE AT LUNCH, THEN I WALK BACK AND TAKE A NAP, DO THE GYM, AND THEN GET SOME MORE WORK DONE.” ANOTHER APARTMENT ON THE FLOOR BENEATH HIS PENTHOUSE FUNCTIONS AS ATELIER, OFFICE, AND SOMETIMES DORMITORIES FOR HIS STAFF. “AND FOR DINNER, I EITHER COME BACK HERE OR MAKE SOMETHING SIMPLE FOR MYSELF.” IF HIS SCHEDULE AND APARTMENT SEEM A RATHER RIGID SCAFFOLDING ON WHICH TO DRAPE HIS DAILY LIFE, MR OWENS DOESN’T FIND IT – OR HIS GRAND, BRUTALIST FURNITURE – TO BE AT ALL UNCOMFORTABLE. “I HAD A VERY FORMAL VISION IN MIND,” HE SAYS. “A VERY SEVERE FORMALITY. BUT WHENEVER I DO THAT THERE ARE HUGE PLACES TO SPRAWL. PEOPLE SAY, ‘THE FURNITURE IS SO SEVERE,’ AND I GO, ‘YEAH, BUT I HAVE HUGE MATTRESSES THAT YOU JUST PLOP ON TOP.’ SO IT’S ALL ABOUT RECLINING.” THE BLACK MARBLE TOILETS, SHAPED LIKE THRONES, HE SAYS, “ARE JUST ABOUT KEEPING EVERYTHING KIND OF SUPERNATURAL, AND BEING AS THOROUGH WITH AN AESTHETIC AS POSSIBLE.” AND, WEIRDLY, THIS SUPERMAN CASTLE FITS VERY NATURALLY HERE ON THE LIDO. THE TRAVERTINE IS OF COURSE VERY VENETIAN, COVERING FACADES ALL OVER THE TOWN. AND THE ART DECO TOUCHES ARE OF A PIECE WITH THE GRAND CASINO HERE, IN WHICH THE VENICE FILM FESTIVAL BEGINS AT THE END OF AUGUST. “IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SILLY TO DO SOMETHING OVERLY THEATRICAL, SOMETHING DESTROYED AND BRUTALIST,” MR OWENS SAYS. “I THINK THIS HAS A REAL CONTINUITY WITH THE COMMUNITY.” MR OWENS’ REMOVE LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE OF PURITY AND CLARITY. A CLARITY THAT HE HAS MADE MARBLE WITH HIS APARTMENT HERE, THE BETTER TO KEEP HIS ATTENTION ON THE HORIZON, ON THE BIG IDEAS, ON THE ETERNAL. “DEATH, MORTALITY AND UTOPIA,” AS MR OWENS SAYS, “ALL MY GREAT THEMES.” “I NEEDED TO CREATE A SPACE THAT WAS SEVERE AND AVOIDED ANY KIND OF SENTIMENTALITY OR ATTACHMENTS, A BLANK SLATE,” HE SAYS, “TO COMPLETELY OBLITERATE [EXTRANEOUS NOISE], TO CONCENTRATE ON LISTENING TO WHAT I REALLY WANT. LIVING IN CLUTTER AND CHAOS AND THINGS THAT ARE HALF DONE OR THAT ARE HALF-HEARTED, I THINK, CAN ALLOW YOU TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOO RELAXED. I CAN’T BE RELAXED. AFTER YOU’VE SHOWERED AND BRUSHED YOUR TEETH IN A MARBLE CUBE, YOU’RE GOING TO ASPIRE TO SOMETHING A LITTLE HIGHER. YOU’RE GOING TO ATTEMPT SOMETHING MORE EXTREME. SO THAT’S WHAT I WAS DOING. I WAS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT FOR MYSELF THAT WOULD FORCE ME TO DEMAND MORE AND DEMAND SOMETHING BETTER. AND I HAVE TO BE AT MY VERY, VERY, BEST.” THE GENTLE SOUNDS OF THE SURF AND THE HAZY HORIZON HERE CONTINUE TO CALL ONE’S MIND TO THE BIG IDEAS, ETERNAL, ELEMENTAL THINGS. NOT THAT HE’S EXACTLY UNAWARE OF THE IMMEDIATE WORLD AROUND HIM. HE MAY BE HAPPIER WITH HIS NOSE IN A BOOK, BUT HE GOES ONLINE. A RECENT PIECE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES DECLARED MR OWENS ONE OF THE LAST GREAT INDEPENDENT DESIGNERS. AND HE KNOWS ABOUT IT, KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE BUSINESS AND THE CULTURE OF FASHION, KNOWS WHERE HE FITS IN TO IT — AND WHERE HE WANTS TO GO. LOOKING OUT ON THE LIMITLESS-SEEMING SOFT SEA, HE IS MAKING PLANS FOR WHAT HE CALLS HIS “SECOND ACT,” THE NEXT CHAPTER IN HIS LIFE’S WORK.

MEET THE MOST FASCINATING DESIGNER ON THE PLANET. THE PALACE DOORS FLEW OPEN. IT WAS HIM. IT WAS RICK OWENS, THE AMERICAN-BORN DESIGNER KNOWN TO HIS FANS AS THE LORD OF DARKNESS. AND HE WAS DRESSED: LIKE RICK OWENS. LONG BLACK COAT. TALL BLACK BOOTS. LONG BLACK HAIR. THE SLANTING EARLY-EVENING SUN LIT HIS FACE. I SHOULD MENTION IT WAS UNCOMMONLY GORGEOUS IN PARIS THAT DAY. IT WAS WINTERTIME, BUT THE DAY WAS A LITTLE TELEGRAM FROM SPRING. LIGHT GLINTED OFF GOLDEN DOMES. GIANT CLOUDS WERE LETTING BIG SHAFTS OF LIGHT THROUGH. OWENS PUT ON HIS SUNGLASSES AND LOOKED OUT AT EVERYTHING, AS IF PARIS WERE A FARM HE WAS GLAD HE&#39;D BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO PURCHASE. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT I&#39;D BEEN LATE TO MEET HIM, THERE AT THE PETIT PALAIS, WHERE HE WAS GOING TO SHOW ME HIS FAVORITE PAINTINGS. LATE ENOUGH THAT THE MUSEUM GUARD WOULDN&#39;T LET ME IN. (“BUT I NEED TO MEET UP WITH A FRIEND INSIDE!” I TOLD THE GUARD. “OHHHH”—HE MADE A SAD FACE—“TON AMI!”) I WALKED UP TO OWENS ALREADY APOLOGIZING. BUT IT SEEMED HE&#39;D FORGOTTEN OUR APPOINTMENT ENTIRELY. HE SMILED SWEETLY, LOOKING, IF ANYTHING, SLIGHTLY ABASHED TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ENJOYING HIMSELF LIKE THAT, IN AN UNGUARDEDLY SUNNY WAY. I EXPLAINED THE WHOLE CATASTROPHE AND HE LAUGHED. I REMEMBERED I&#39;D BROUGHT A PRESENT FOR HIM, A RED WOODEN FOUNTAIN PEN MADE BY A COMPANY CALLED LAMY. OWENS IS MARRIED TO THE FAMOUS ART- AND FASHION-WORLD FIGURE MICHÈLE LAMY—THE COUPLE HAVE BEEN AT THE HEART OF AVANT-GARDE PARIS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, EVER SINCE THEY ARRIVED HERE FROM LOS ANGELES. I FIGURED THEY&#39;D BOTH BE DELIGHTED BY THE COINCIDENCE OF THE NAME. “YEAH,” HE SAID, NOT SMIRKING BUT SORT OF POLITELY HALF SMILING, “THIS IS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES UP WHEN YOU TYPE THAT NAME INTO GOOGLE.” HE HANDED THE PEN BACK TO ME. HE ACTUALLY HANDED IT BACK TO ME. NOTE NOW: HE HAD BEEN SWEET (ABOUT MY LATENESS) WHEN ANOTHER MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN A D CK. HE HAD BEEN TRUTHFUL AND DIRECT (ABOUT MY SAD, APOLOGETIC GIFT) WHEN ANOTHER MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN FALSELY SWEET OR CRYPTO-CONDESCENDING OR ELSE INDIFFERENT. “DID YOU GET TO SEE SOME GOOD ART?” I ASKED. “YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT,” HE SAID. “I HAD AN EXPERIENCE THAT COMPLETELY CHANGED EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW AS A DESIGNER. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT SORT OF KILLS ME THAT YOU WEREN&#39;T THERE.” I TRIED TO MAKE MY CHEEK MUSCLES HOLD, BUT MY FACE COLLAPSED INTO WHAT I KNEW WAS A STRICKEN LOOK, THE FACE OF SOMEONE SUDDENLY SICK IN THE BOWELS. HE SMILED AGAIN. HE&#39;D BEEN JOKING, OF COURSE. “NO,” HE SAID, “BUT I DID SEE A PAINTING THAT GAVE ME A THOUGHT FOR WHERE I MIGHT GO WITH MY NEXT COLLECTION.” “SERIOUS THIS TIME?” “YES,” HE SAID. THERE HAD BEEN A SPECIAL EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS MADE IN PARIS BY DUTCH ARTISTS. “I SAW THIS INCREDIBLE RUFF,” HE SAID. HE PULLED OUT HIS IPHONE AND SHOWED ME A PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN SITTING AND SEVERAL CLOSE-UPS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY WHITE GARMENT SHE WAS WEARING. A DRESS MADE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THOUSANDS OF FOLDS OF WHITE MUSLIN, CINCHED IN SO TIGHTLY AT THE WAIST IT APPEARED, AT JUST THAT ZONE OF HER TORSO, TO HAVE BECOME A CORSET. THE DRESS EXPLODED AT THE NECKLINE INTO THIS RUFF, WHICH HAD CAPTIVATED OWENS. “I&#39;VE BEEN DOING A BLOB THING FOR A WHILE NOW,” HE SAID. “BULGES AND BLOBS.” IT WAS TRUE. MANY OF HIS LATEST PIECES SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN TUMORS. THE CLOTHES HAD SWALLOWED THEIR OWN FANNY PACKS AND WORE THEM LIKE DEER LUMPS IN A PYTHON. THEY WERE FUTURISTIC, BUT FROM A RUBE GOLDBERG FUTURE WHERE WE HAD TO TURN ABSURD TO SURVIVE. HE ZOOMED IN ON THE RUFF. DETAIL, REVELATORY, GLORIOUS. ITS DRAPERY WAS ALMOST INDIFFERENT, SCARF-LIKE. IT WAS SENSUAL. “I WANT TO TAKE THAT AND DAMAGE IT,” OWENS SAID. AT THAT MOMENT, THREE KIDS CAME RUNNING UP THE STAIRS, STRAIGHT TOWARD US. TWO YOUNG WOMEN AND A GUY WITH SHORT DREADS. THERE WERE A LOT OF STEPS, SO WE WATCHED THEM RUNNING FOR A WHILE. THE GUY HAD A FRENCH ACCENT BUT SPOKE IDIOMATIC ENGLISH: “RICK, MAN! RICK! CAN WE GET A PICTURE?” “SURE!” SAID OWENS. IT WAS AS IF HE&#39;D JUST BUMPED INTO AN OLD FRIEND. SOMEBODY HANDED ME A CAMERA. THE PICTURE WOULD BE BETTER, THE KIDS EXPLAINED, IF I WERE TO TAKE IT. I TOOK A FEW. THE KIDS WORE WIDE, BRIGHT SMILES. “THANK YOU, RICK!” THEN THEY RAN OFF. “SHOULD WE GO?” SAID OWENS. HE WAS LOOKING OFF, DOWN THE STEPS. THE BLACK CAR THAT DRIVES HIM AROUND WAS SUDDENLY PARKED THERE. IT HAD PULLED UP CLOSER THAN IT SEEMED LIKE CARS COULD PULL UP, ALMOST TO THE FOOT OF THE STEPS. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING BATMAN ABOUT IT EVEN IF OWENS HAD NOT BEEN DRESSED LIKE AN EXTREMELY HIP ANDROGYNOUS BATMAN. WE DESCENDED THE STEPS TOGETHER—HE IN BOOTS AND FLOWING COAT, I IN MY PANTS AND WHATEVER—AND CLIMBED INTO THE CAR. PEOPLE WERE WATCHING. I WONDERED WHO THEY THOUGHT I WAS. HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW. DRIVING THROUGH PARIS, CROSSING BRIDGES, SMOOTHLY AND QUIETLY MAKING SHARP CORNERS ON NARROW STREETS. HOW DID HE FEEL ABOUT THE FAME THING? DID IT BOTHER HIM THAT HE COULDN&#39;T GO OUT AND WALK AROUND LIKE A NORMAL PERSON ANYMORE? “I DON&#39;T REALLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT,” HE SAID. “I&#39;M NOT THAT KIND OF FAMOUS.” “REALLY? BUT WE&#39;D BEEN ON THE STEPS FOR, LIKE, 30 SECONDS WHEN THOSE KIDS CAME RUNNING…” “OH, WELL,” HE SAID, “I GUESS THAT&#39;S TRUE. OKAY, SURE, WHEN I&#39;M OUT IN THE CITY, PEOPLE EVERY SO OFTEN APPROACH ME AND SAY NICE, POSITIVE THINGS. IT&#39;S NOT HARD TO LIVE WITH.” HIS SPEECH RHYTHMS REMAIN AMERICAN AND CALIFORNIAN. THERE&#39;S EVEN SOME DUDE IN HIS VOICE—NOT SURFER-SKATER, SOMETHING MORE EVENLY TOASTED. HE HAS NEVER LEARNED FRENCH BEYOND THE TOURIST LEVEL, DESPITE HAVING LIVED IN PARIS FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. HE IS UP-FRONT AND UNDEFENSIVE ABOUT HIS BAD FRENCH. “WHEN WE FIRST CAME TO PARIS,” HE SAID, “IT WAS IMMEDIATELY ESSENTIAL TO HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO COULD REALLY COMMUNICATE WELL. WE COULDN&#39;T AFFORD FOR ME TO F CK UP. SO I HAD A BUBBLE AROUND ME. AND IT&#39;S BEEN THERE.” “SO WHY COME TO PARIS AT ALL?” I ASKED. “IS IT THAT YOU HAVE BETTER RESOURCES HERE? MORE HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE?” “NO.” “OR FOR BUSINESS REASONS? THE ‘FASHION ECONOMY’?” “NO,” HE SAID. “IT&#39;S THE POETRY. THERE&#39;S JUST A POETIC WEIRDNESS TO THE FASHION HERE THAT DOESN&#39;T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE. THERE&#39;S A SENSE OF ABSTRACTION AND ALMOST DADA. THERE CAME A POINT WHERE, TO BE THE DESIGNER I WANTED TO BE, I HAD TO GET SMARTER. AND THE STUFF YOU SEE HERE IS JUST ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL. ” THE NEXT DAY, I STOPPED BY OWENS&#39;S STORE IN THE PALAIS ROYAL, NEAR THE LOUVRE, AND SAW THE EERILY CONVINCING WAXWORK OF HIM THAT STANDS NEAR THE COUNTER, STARING IMPASSIVELY, WEARING A MACHO SKIRT. LATER, IN HIS WORKSHOP, I ASKED OWENS TO TRY TO REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME HE&#39;D TAKEN AN INTEREST IN A PIECE OF CLOTHING. HE CLOSED HIS EYES FOR A SECOND. “I WANTED JEANS WHEN I WAS 12,” HE SAID. “MY MOM BOUGHT ME POLYESTER JEANS. I LOOKED AT THEM AND THOUGHT, ‘THESE LOOK DIFFERENT. SOMETHING&#39;S WRONG.’ ” “DID SHE NOT WANT YOU TO HAVE DENIM ONES?” “SHE CONSIDERED JEANS TRASHY,” HE SAID. I WAS EATING HIS MOTHER&#39;S COOKIES. CONCEPCIÓN OWENS—CONNIE—HAD FLOWN TO PARIS TO VISIT HER SON AND HAD AIRMAILED HUNDREDS OF THEM TO HIM BEFORE HER ARRIVAL. (“IF I DIDN&#39;T MAKE HER SHIP THEM,” HE SAID, “SHE WOULD CARRY THEM IN HER SUITCASE.”) OWENS&#39;S FATHER HAD MET HER IN MEXICO, WHERE HE&#39;D TAUGHT ENGLISH FOR A FEW YEARS, AND THEY HAD EVENTUALLY SETTLED DOWN IN PORTERVILLE, IN CALIFORNIA&#39;S SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IN MEXICO, AS A YOUNG WOMAN, CONNIE HAD WORKED AS A SEAMSTRESS AND LEARNED HOW TO CUT PATTERNS. SHE MUST BE NUMBERED AMONG OWENS&#39;S FIRST FASHION INFLUENCES, ALTHOUGH THE TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN INDIRECT. THE COOKIES WERE GREAT. I ATE ABOUT 12. OWENS ATE NONE. HE IS HEALTHY AND LOOKS AS HE ENTERS HIS LATE 50S AS IF HE WERE A DECADE YOUNGER. HIS HAIR HAS PERHAPS THINNED SLIGHTLY, BUT HE KEEPS DYEING IT COAL BLACK AND WEARING IT LONG. HE MADE A MOVIE OF THIS, OF HIS SELF-DYEING PROCESS AT THE SINK, AND POSTED IT ON THE WEB. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. HE&#39;S A BEAUTIFUL GHOUL. HIS FACE IS CUBIST; IT HAS PLANES. HE IS SPANISH-LOOKING, AS IN GALICIAN OR CATALAN, BUT MAYBE I THOUGHT THAT ONLY BECAUSE HIS FACE IS CUBIST. HE SAID HE TAKES A 45-MINUTE NAP EVERY DAY AT ABOUT ONE IN THE AFTERNOON. HE WON&#39;T SCHEDULE FLIGHTS IF THEY INTERFERE WITH IT. OWENS DESCRIBES GROWING UP IN PORTERVILLE AS FAIRLY STULTIFYING. HE UNDERWENT “THE WHOLE CYCLE OF BEING RAISED IN A VERY CONTROLLED WAY AND REACTING IN MY TEENS BY GOING OUT OF CONTROL. ALCOHOL AND DRUGS. VERY FLAMBOYANT AND EXTRAVAGANT.” AND THEN HE MOVED TO LOS ANGELES, WHERE THINGS GOT FULL FREAKY. FIRST HE ATTENDED ART SCHOOL (ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST PAINTING), THEN HE WENT TO TRADE SCHOOL (SEWING AND PATTERNMAKING), THEN HE TOOK A JOB AT SOME SORT OF SWEATSHOP, MAKING “CHEAP FASHION KNOCKOFFS.” ALONG THE WAY, HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF, AND THE CITY TRANSFORMED HIM, INTO (IN HIS OWN WORDS) “A SKINNY WHITE VODKA-SWILLING GOTH.” IT WAS IN L.A. THAT HE MET A PERSON WHO WAS DESTINED TO BECOME, AFTER HIS MOTHER, THE MOST IMPORTANT WOMAN IN HIS LIFE, A CREATURE AS SUI GENERIS AS HE. I DON&#39;T KNOW QUITE HOW TO TELL YOU WHO MICHÈLE LAMY IS. SHE&#39;S AN ELF WITCH PRIESTESS. SHE&#39;S AN UNACKNOWLEDGED LEGISLATOR IN MULTIPLE CULTURAL SPHERES. A$AP ROCKY CALLS HER HIS “FAIRY GODMOM” AND CREATIVE MENTOR. SHE IS SCARY AND SEXY AND NICE. SHE IS MARRIED TO OWENS. WHO IS BISEXUAL. I MEAN, HE IS OWENS, BUT... ANYWAY, THEY ARE IN LOVE. THAT&#39;S GETTING AHEAD OF THE STORY, THOUGH. THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE IN BED TOGETHER IS ONE TO WHICH A PERSON MIGHT RESPOND, “GOD ONLY KNOWS!” BUT GOD COULD NEVER BE TACKY ENOUGH TO PEEK AND MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WOULD SEE IF HE DID. LAMY HAD MOVED FROM FRANCE TO L.A. IN THE 1970S, AND IN 1996 SHE HAD OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE, LES DEUX CAFÉS, SO NAMED BECAUSE IT WAS MADE FROM TWO BUILDINGS JOINED TOGETHER, A JAZZ CLUB AND A CRAFTSMAN HOUSE SHE&#39;D HAD TRANSPORTED TO THE SITE. YOU ENTERED THROUGH A BACK PARKING LOT ON A DINGY STRETCH OF NORTH LAS PALMAS. THE PLACE BECAME SO HIP IT WAS CREDITED BY AN L.A. CITY COUNCILWOMAN WITH HAVING BROUGHT FILM AND POST-PRODUCTION STUDIOS BACK TO HOLLYWOOD. LAMY DANCED THERE FOR HER CUSTOMERS SOMETIMES. WHEN SHE WAS THE RIGHT KIND OF DRUNK. WHEN SHE FELT LIKE IT. WAS IT THERE, AT SUCH A MOMENT, THAT OWENS FIRST SAW HER? HE ISN&#39;T SURE. OWENS&#39;S L.A. YEARS WERE ALCOHOLIC AND SMEARED. “I WAS A SLOPPY, B TCHY DRUNK,” HE SAID. “I WAS MEAN. I HATE THAT. BUT I WAS.” THERE IS MUCH HE CAN&#39;T RECALL. IT GOT TO WHERE HE NEEDED TWO SHOTS OF VODKA TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING. HE WOKE UP UNDER A FREEWAY OVERPASS. THERE WERE THREE-DAY BLACKOUTS. HE WAS MORE THAN ONCE NEAR DEATH. HE WOULD OFTEN “LOSE THE CAR.” HE SAID, “YOU KNOW, IT&#39;S FUNNY, I STILL HAVE DREAMS: ‘OH F CK, I BURIED A BODY THERE...’ OR ‘OH, MY GOD, I RAN OVER SOMEBODY THERE...’ I MEAN, FOR ALL I KNOW...” IT WOULDN&#39;T BE CORRECT, I DON&#39;T THINK, TO SAY THAT LAMY STABILIZED OR “TAMED” HIM WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER. SHE HAD HER OWN WILDNESS. BUT SHE WAS LESS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE AND KNEW HOW TO PULL THEM BOTH BACK FROM LEDGES. HE&#39;D NEVER BEEN IN A REAL RELATIONSHIP BEFORE. “PUT IT THIS WAY,” HE SAID, “I&#39;VE NEVER BROKEN UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.” “MEANING YOU WERE NEVER CLOSE ENOUGH TO SOMEBODY THAT BREAKING UP WAS NECESSARY?” I ASKED. “RIGHT,” HE SAID. “THEN, AT A CERTAIN POINT, I FELT LIKE, ‘SOMEONE IS MISSING IN MY LIFE.’ AND SOMEHOW I HAD ENOUGH SELF-PRESERVATION IN ME TO REALIZE, ‘I NEED THIS.’ ” BEFORE SHE BECAME HIS WIFE, SHE WAS HIS BOSS. THAT&#39;S WHAT PEOPLE DON&#39;T KNOW ABOUT LAMY. THE ONE THING SHE NEVER TALKS ABOUT BEING IS THE THING SHE MOST WAS: A FRENCH FASHION DESIGNER. IN 1983 THE LOS ANGELES TIMESREPORTED THAT PATTI DAVIS, DAUGHTER OF RONALD REAGAN, WAS WEARING LAMY, INCLUDING A T-SHIRT “WITH SEAMS THAT SHOW ON THE OUTSIDE.” IN 1987 SHE GROSSED $6 MILLION IN RETAIL SALES. IT IS STRANGE THAT YOU CAN READ ABOUT HER FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS AND NEVER SEE THIS MENTIONED, THAT SHE USED TO DO WHAT OWENS DOES NOW. THAT SHE GAVE HIM HIS FIRST REAL JOB AS A DESIGNER. THAT SHE INFLUENCED HIS APPROACH TO DESIGN IN A VISIBLE WAY. OWENS DIDN&#39;T TELL ME THIS, AND I DOUBT HE&#39;D AGREE, BUT MY SENSE IS THAT IN SOME SUBTLE AND COMPLEX WAY, THEY NEGOTIATED A SHIFTING OF POWER OVER THE YEARS. POSSIBLY IT WAS DONE WITHOUT SPEAKING. SHE WANED SO HE COULD WAX. NO, NOT “WANED.” SHE EVOLVED. AS DID HE. BUT IF, AS PEOPLE USED TO SAY, BEHIND EVERY GREAT MAN IS A GREAT WOMAN, IT&#39;S ALSO THE CASE THAT GREAT WOMEN WILL SOMETIMES FIND MEN TO WORK THROUGH, TO BROADCAST THROUGH. THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER, INTO A WEIRD CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS ACROSS THE STREET FROM LES DEUX. OWENS&#39;S DESCRIPTION OF THE DECOR WAS ALSO THE BEST DESCRIPTION I&#39;D EVER ENCOUNTERED OF HIS AESTHETIC SENSIBILITY. “IT HAD AGE MARKS,” HE SAID. “PAINT PEELING OFF, LINOLEUM THAT LOOKED LIKE DARK MARBLE. SUPER-GORGEOUS CURVY FELT-COVERED COUCHES. BIG MIRROR. LONG, BEAUTIFUL GRAY WOOL CURTAINS. THEY HAD A MURKINESS. IN THE BEDROOM THERE WERE THESE FELTED WOOL BLANKETS HANGING IN THE WINDOWS. THERE WERE GATES IN THE BACK THAT LED OUT TO THE ALLEY. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD WAS REALLY SKETCHY THEN. THERE WAS THAT OUTLAW VIBE WE BOTH LOVED.” HE MADE THE PLACE HIS STUDIO. FOR SOME TIME THE FREAKIEST L.A. FREAKS DANCED THROUGH THE ROOMS. OWENS WORKED LIKE A MANIAC EVERY DAY, FORGING A STYLE THAT WAS PART DISSOLVING LUXURY, PART ELEGANT SLEEPING BAG. THERE HAD BEEN PUNK-CHIC BEFORE, BUT THESE CLOTHES FREAKED PEOPLE OUT (THEY STILL FREAK ME OUT)—AND THEY WERE TRULY CHIC. OWENS COULD MAKE HIS MODELS LOOK LIKE UNTOUCHABLE QUEENS (HE HAD NOT DONE A MENSWEAR LINE YET), THEN TRANSFORM THEM, IN AS LITTLE TIME AS IT TOOK TO DO A BACKSTAGE OUTFIT CHANGE, INTO DAMAGED ALIEN ALLEY RATS WITH VACANT EYES AND DISTENDED TORSOS. CRITICS HAD A HARD TIME SAYING WHICH WAS MORE SEDUCTIVE, THE DAMAGE OR THE DIVINITY. BUT TO HAVE A DESIGNER SO AUTHENTICALLY LOW—NOT EUROPEAN BUT AMERICAN, NOT NEW YORK BUT CALIFORNIA, NOT L.A. BUT SMALL-TOWN, NOT DIAMONDS AND TANS BUT TATTOOS AND NOSE RINGS—GO SO HIGH, SO EXPERIMENTAL? THAT WAS SOMETHING NEW. ONE OF HIS EARLIEST DESIGNS, FROM 1994, WAS A NYLON T-SHIRT THAT HAD A ROW OF BEADS SEWN INTO THE FABRIC OF THE SLEEVES, SUCH THAT THE BEADS THEMSELVES WERE NOT VISIBLE, ONLY THE LUMPS THEY MADE. WEARING THE SHIRT, YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE SPROUTING AN EXOSKELETAL SPINE ON EACH ARM. LITTLE MOVE, MUCH EFFECT. EMPHATIC, STRANGE, SKILLFUL. AND PEOPLE NOTICED. ROCK STARS AND MOVIE STARS STARTED WANTING TO WEAR HIS GEAR. BUT IT WAS ALL THE OPPOSITE OF OVERNIGHT SUCCESS. WHEN HE HAD HIS FIRST SERIOUS RUNWAY SHOW, HE WAS ALMOST 40. THAT&#39;S 140 IN FASHION YEARS. WHEN HE WON HIS FIRST BIG AWARD, HE TOLD REPORTERS HE FELT “LIKE A VAMPIRE.” THE ENERGY IN L.A. CHANGED WHEN OWENS AND LAMY GOT ROBBED AT GUNPOINT ONE NIGHT. THE ROBBER RIPPED ALL OF LAMY&#39;S RINGS OFF HER FINGERS. “AND SHE WEARS A LOT OF RINGS,” OWENS SAID. “WE WERE NEVER COMFORTABLE THERE AGAIN.” THEY MOVED THE NEXT DAY, INTO THE CHATEAU MARMONT, WHERE THEY STAYED FOR A YEAR. “YOU MUST HAVE SEEN CRAZY S IT THERE,” I SAID. “I WAS THE CRAZY S IT,” OWENS SAID. HE GOT SICK OF DRINKING. HE WAS AMONG THE GENETICALLY FORTUNATE WHO WIND UP HATING IT MORE THAN THEY LOVE IT. HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN USING IT, TO GET SOMEWHERE. WHEN IT STOPPED MOVING HIM FORWARD, HE SWITCHED CHANNELS, OPTING FOR SOMETHING CLOSER TO STRAIGHT-EDGE, STILL HEDONISTIC BUT SAYING YES TO LIFE. TO LIFE AND DARKNESS. ONE EVENING OWENS TOOK ME TO THE OWENSCORP SHOWROOM IN LE MARAIS, WHERE THE COLLECTION THAT HE HAD JUST DEBUTED AT PARIS FASHION WEEK WAS HANGING. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I&#39;D BEEN THAT CLOSE TO FASHION IN THE RAW, EXAMINING CHOICES AS IF THEY COULD STILL BE UNDONE. AT FIRST I WAS MOSTLY APPRECIATING THE COLORS, THE PALETTE, WHICH OWENS SAID CAME FROM A HORROR-MOVIE POSTER: “IT WAS A WEREWOLF MOVIE FROM THE &#39;30S. I SAW IT ON ITUNES. IT WAS A PERFECT BLEND OF WHITE WITH THAT ORANGE AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF THAT BLUE.” OWENS, IN DISCUSSING THIS COLLECTION, HAD TENDED TO TALK IT DOWN SOME. “I&#39;M VERY CRITICAL OF THIS COLLECTION,” HE&#39;D SAID, “BECAUSE THERE&#39;S A SUSPICION IN ME THAT I PHONED IT IN. I DIDN&#39;T INVENT ANYTHING NEW. IT WAS EXTENDING. I&#39;M REPEATING MYSELF, BECAUSE I&#39;M NOT THAT COMPLICATED.” I MAYBE KNEW WHAT HE MEANT. THE COLLECTION WAS MORE SUBDUED THAN SOME OF HIS OTHER WORK, BUT IT ALSO TRANSMITTED A DEEP, CLEAR INTELLIGENCE. NOTHING WAS BORING. NOTHING SEEMED DONE INDIFFERENTLY. ABOVE MY HEAD, ON A LARGE VIDEO SCREEN, THE RUNWAY SHOW IN WHICH THESE PIECES HAD FIRST BEEN SHOWN, DAYS EARLIER, PLAYED ON A LOOP, SO I COULD TURN MY EYES UP AND SEE WHAT THESE CLOTHES LOOKED LIKE ON HUMAN BEINGS. THAT WAS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING. THE DRAPING. OWENS HAS LONG BEEN REVERED AMONG FASHION AFICIONADOS FOR HIS DRAPING. IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS HE&#39;D MENTIONED WHEN I&#39;D ASKED HIM WHY THE RUFF IN THE PORTRAIT AT THE PETIT PALAIS: “THE WAY IT&#39;S DRAPED—IT&#39;S KIND OF AMISH AND KIND OF VOLUPTUOUS.” DRAPING IS ABOUT THE BODY. THE REASON OWENS IS ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THE STRANGE DISTORTIONS AND EVEN DEFORMITIES THAT MARK HIS CLOTHES IS HIS UNDERLYING FEEL FOR THE HUMAN SHAPE, FOR HOW FAR IS TOO FAR IN A GIVEN DESIGN. WHEN HE GOES TOO FAR, YOU KNOW HE MEANT IT. I SHOULD MENTION: THE WAY THE EMPLOYEES&#39; FACES LIT UP WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE SHOWROOM! ROWS AND ROWS OF THEM SITTING AT LONG BLACK TABLES. STARING WITH RAPTURE. HUNGER. PRIDE. ALSO A KIND OF FEAR THAT MADE THEM GLOW. THEY WERE LIKE INSTRUMENTS WHOSE HIGHEST STRINGS HAD JUST BEEN PLUCKED. I LOST COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HE INTRODUCED BY SAYING, “SHE&#39;S BEEN WITH ME SINCE…” OFTEN THE PERSON&#39;S JOB HAD CHANGED OVER THE YEARS. I MET ONE WOMAN WHO WORKED IN SALES, AND OWENS SAID, “SHE STARTED OFF MODELING FOR US IN L.A.” THIS WAS TRUE OF A SURPRISING NUMBER OF FOLKS—THAT THEY HAD JOINED THE TEAM DURING THE CALIFORNIA DAYS. AFTER A FEW MINUTES, OWENS ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE GOING TO LOOK AT A NEW JACKET HE HAD MADE. A MAN NAMED GIULIO MET US AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS. HE WAS SLENDER, WITH LONG BROWN HAIR JUST TOUCHED BY GRAY AT THE SIDES, AND HAD A FACE OF EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY, FINE-BONED AND FEMININE. “GIULIO HAS BEEN WITH ME SINCE 2001,” OWENS SAID, “SINCE I WAS JUST MANUFACTURING, NOT DOING SHOWS.” WE WALKED DOWN A HALLWAY, PAST A SERIES OF EMPTY ROOMS. NATURAL LIGHT SPILLED IN FROM SMALL WINDOWS HIGH ABOVE. WE CAME TO A SPACE WITH A GIANT MIRROR. GIULIO TOOK A JACKET OUT OF A BAG AND HELD IT AS OWENS SLID INTO IT, LOOKING FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY VULNERABLE IN THE WAY MEN ALWAYS DO WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE IS DRESSING THEM. THE JACKET WAS LONG—IT SEEMED TO ELONGATE HIS TORSO, SHORTEN HIS LEGS. HAD THERE NOT BEEN SOMETHING PERFECT ABOUT IT, A PERSON MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CUT “WRONG.” AS IT WAS, IT LOOKED ELEGANT. IT HAD WEIRD BEAUTY. PARTLY I SAY “WEIRD BEAUTY” BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY TWO FAVORITE WORDS TO USE TOGETHER AND EVIDENTLY WILL BE UNTIL I GO TO MY GRAVE. PARTLY I SAY IT BECAUSE OWENS HIMSELF HAD DONE SO, THE DAY BEFORE. “I&#39;VE ALWAYS RESISTED RULES BASED ON BIGOTRY OR SUPERSTITION OR CONVENTION,” HE&#39;D SAID. “WHAT I&#39;M DOING IS I GO, ‘I THINK THIS IS WEIRDLY BEAUTIFUL, DON&#39;T YOU?’ LET&#39;S THINK ABOUT OTHER VERSIONS OF BEAUTY THAT AREN&#39;T SO CLICHÉD.” WHILE OWENS SCRUTINIZED HIS REFLECTION, GIULIO STOOD BEHIND HIM TAKING PHONE PICS OF HIS BACK. HE WOULD TAKE A COUPLE, THEN HAND THE PHONE TO OWENS, SHOWING HIM THE ONE PERSPECTIVE ON THE JACKET THAT OWENS COULDN&#39;T GET. OWENS DIDN&#39;T LIKE IT. THE JACKET, I MEAN. HE WAS DISSATISFIED. HE WAS MAKING GRUMPY FACES. “SEE THIS PUCKER UNDER THE ARMPIT,” HE SAID. I LOOKED. I DID SEE IT. “THEY TOOK AWAY TOO MUCH,” HE SAID, “AND NOT IN THE CORRECT WAY.” HE AND GIULIO STARTED TO REMINISCE ABOUT ANOTHER TAILOR WHO HAD BEEN BETTER, WHO WOULDN&#39;T HAVE MADE THIS MISTAKE. OWENS MADE GIULIO TRY ON THE JACKET. GIULIO&#39;S SMILE BECAME SHEEPISH BUT REMAINED BEAUTIFUL. “I LIKE IT BETTER ON YOU THAN ON ME,” OWENS SAID. HE LOOKED DOWN AT GIULIO&#39;S BOOTS. “ARE THESE NEW? THEY LOOK GREAT.” GIULIO GAVE A NONCOMMITTAL ANSWER, LIKE HE COULDN&#39;T REMEMBER WHEN HE&#39;D BOUGHT THEM. “SOME PEOPLE HAVE SHOES FROM A FEW YEARS AGO,” OWENS SAID. “I DON&#39;T LIKE LOOKING AT THEM.” I ASKED IF THAT HAPPENED OFTEN, THAT HE WOULD RUN INTO PEOPLE WEARING HIS CLOTHES AND FIND HE DIDN&#39;T LIKE THEIR STYLE. “EVERY SO OFTEN,” HE SAID, “I&#39;LL BE AT A PARTY AND GET INTRODUCED TO SOMEONE AND THINK, ‘YOU&#39;RE WEARING MY GREATEST REGRET.’ ” OWENS EXCUSED HIMSELF TO PRESIDE OVER A STAFF MEETING. WHEN IT WAS DONE, AND AS EVERYONE WAS GOING HOME FOR THE DAY, OWENS PULLED ASIDE ONE EMPLOYEE, THE FIRST PERSON I&#39;D SEEN WHO WASN&#39;T WEARING OWENS. OWENS MADE INTRODUCTIONS. TURNED OUT THE MAN WAS IN CHARGE OF DISTRIBUTION IN A MAJOR ASIAN COUNTRY. OWENS STEPPED FORWARD AS THOUGH TO SPEAK WITH HIM MORE PRIVATELY, AND I RETREATED BACK TO A NEARBY BENCH. OWENS CHANGED HIS BODY LANGUAGE. HE PUT HIS HANDS ON THE MAN&#39;S SHOULDERS THE WAY MEN SOMETIMES DO WHEN THEY WANT TO ASSERT POWER. “[MAN&#39;S NAME],” HE SAID, IN WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A PHILOSOPHICALLY QUIZZICAL TONE, “HOW COME WE&#39;RE NOT BIG IN [MAJOR ASIAN COUNTRY]?” IT SEEMED CLEAR TO ME AND, I BELIEVE, TO THE MAN THAT WHAT HE&#39;D MEANT WAS “WHY THE F CK IS IT THAT DESPITE THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PAY YOU, MY BRAND IS NOT DOING AS WELL AS IT MIGHT BE IN [MAJOR ASIAN COUNTRY]?” MORE MUTTERING PASSED BETWEEN THEM, NOT ANGRY BUT STERN. OWENS REMOVED HIS HANDS. “THANK YOU, RICK,” SAID THE MAN. “YOU ALWAYS HAVE GOOD WORDS.” THEN HE QUICKLY LEFT. OWENS SAT BACK DOWN. “THAT WAS ME YELLING,” HE SAID. I SAID IT HAD BEEN GENTLE YELLING. “I THINK ABOUT AGGRESSION A LOT,” HE SAID. “I&#39;M ALWAYS CAREFUL ABOUT IT NOW. BUT I&#39;M ALSO CONSCIOUS THAT SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO BARK A LITTLE BIT.” OWENS ON A BENCH IN PARIS, 2018: “I CATCH MYSELF THINKING, ‘WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT FROM ME?’ I HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO SAY, ‘NO, WHAT DO I WANT?’ ” LATER, WHEN ASKED WHAT KIND OF ART IS MOVING HIM LATELY: “LAND ART.” ASKED WHY: “YOU SEE SOMEBODY REACHING FOR SOMETHING BIGGER, LEAVING THEIR MARK, AND IT LOOKS HEROIC. BUT THERE&#39;S THIS SLIGHT MELANCHOLY. BECAUSE THOSE ARTISTS ARE DEAD.” WHEN ASKED WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WHEN HE&#39;S DESIGNING: “I&#39;M THINKING OF MY LIFE. I&#39;M THINKING OF THE WAY I LIVE. I&#39;M THINKING I WANT BRANCUSI TO WEAR ONE OF MY DRESSES WHILE HE&#39;S MAKING A PIECE OF ART. I&#39;M THINKING OF BRANCUSI. I&#39;M THINKING OF EISENSTEIN DRAWINGS. I&#39;M THINKING, ‘I LIKE THE WAY THAT LOOKS.’ ” WHY, ALL THOSE YEARS AGO, DID OWENS GIVE UP PAINTING FOR FASHION? “CLOTHES ARE ABOUT CODES. THAT&#39;S WHAT FASCINATES ME MOST.” ASKED WHAT GOES THROUGH HIS MIND WHEN PEOPLE SEE HIS FREAKY PRE-COLLECTION RUNWAY SHOWS AND SAY, “BUT WHO WOULD ACTUALLY WEAR THIS?”: “I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I REALLY MEAN IT TO BE WORN. THE COMMERCIAL STUFF IN THE END IS GOING TO BE WHAT DEFINES ME. THE RUNWAY SHOWS ARE A FANTASY. THAT&#39;S ME PROJECTING. AND THE STUFF THAT&#39;S THE FURTHEST FAR-OUT GIVES VALUE TO EVERYTHING ELSE.” THE INSTRUCTIONS HE GAVE TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN ALBINO MALE MODEL WHO WALKED FOR HIM AT NEW YORK&#39;S FASHION WEEK IN 2002, THE YEAR HE WON THE PERRY ELLIS AWARD FOR EMERGING TALENT: TO WALK EXTREMELY SLOWLY AND TO WINCE WITH EACH STEP. ON THE INEVITABILITY OF CLIMATE DOOM: “THAT&#39;S FINE. AREN&#39;T WE SUPPOSED TO TURN INTO GAS? WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO LAST. DO WE THINK WE&#39;RE SUPPOSED TO?” ON THE #METOO MOVEMENT: “OF COURSE I STAND WITH THE WOMEN, AND ANYTHING I SAY IS GOING TO BE WRONG, BUT...IT HAS MADE ME THINK, ‘WAIT, I FORGOT, LIFE IS REALLY CRUDE, A LOT OF CRUDE MACHINATIONS, A LOT OF CRUDE URGES.’ PEOPLE ACT LIKE WE&#39;RE MORE HIGH-MINDED AND SOPHISTICATED, AND WE&#39;RE KIND OF NOT. DO WE THINK WE&#39;RE ENTITLED TO LIVE WITHOUT MISBEHAVIOR? THERE&#39;S AN ELEMENT OF MALICE THAT IS PART OF THE WAY THINGS WORK.” (HE&#39;LL PROBABLY TAKE S IT FOR THIS ONLINE. I&#39;M ALMOST HESITANT TO QUOTE IT FOR THAT REASON, AND BECAUSE I HAD BAITED HIM INTO GIVING AN OPINION IN THE FIRST PLACE. I INCLUDE IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY THING I HEARD ANYONE SAY ABOUT #METOO DURING THOSE MONTHS THAT I&#39;D NEVER HEARD BEFORE.) THE NEXT THING HE SAID: “I&#39;M DISTURBED EVERY TIME I LOOK AT THE NEW YORK TIMES AND SEE ‘[EXPLETIVE].’ YOU KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT, PRINT ‘[EXPLETIVE]’ INSTEAD OF ‘S IT’ OR ‘F CK’ OR WHATEVER? FOR US STILL TO BE SO SQUEAMISH AND INDIGNANT ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR.” ON ONLINE COMMENTS ABOUT HIS WORK: “THE INTERNET HAS ERECTED THIS MOB OF OPINIONS THAT CAN BE VERY CONSERVATIVE, NOT POLITICALLY—OR NOT NECESSARILY POLITICAL—BUT STATUS QUO. YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY EVERYTHING DEVOLVES INTO AGGRESSION, PEOPLE DEBATING PROSAIC THINGS. HOW THE LOUDEST DOMINATE. I DO KNOW THIS: THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE I&#39;M DELIGHTED TO BE OFFENDING.” ON HIS OWN SUCCESS: “THE GENIE IS OUT OF THE BOTTLE. I&#39;M NEVER GOING TO BE NICHE AGAIN. I&#39;M COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WEIRD AND UNATTAINABLE AGAIN. THAT&#39;S WHAT I WANTED TO BE—TO LIVE IN POVERTY BUT BE LIKE GIACOMETTI.” ON HIS ASOCIAL TENDENCIES AND INCREASING AVOIDANCE OF PARTIES: “I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT BEING MORE GREGARIOUS. THE FUNNY THING IS, WHEN I DECIDE NOT TO BE, I&#39;M NOT SHY. BUT I&#39;VE ELIMINATED THAT WHOLE WORLD. AT A CERTAIN POINT, I HAD TO ASK MYSELF, ‘WHAT&#39;S OF MORE VALUE?’ I HAVE MY PARTNERS, MY BUSINESS PARTNERS. THAT&#39;S MY COMFORT LEVEL.” ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MAIN REASON HE CAN GET AWAY WITH AVOIDING PARTIES IS THAT ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT HE AND LAMY ARE HOSTING A TOTALLY FASCINATING DINNER PARTY THAT&#39;S PROBABLY AS CLOSE TO AN 18TH-CENTURY SALON AS PARIS COMES THESE DAYS: NOTHING, BECAUSE I DIDN&#39;T ASK HIM THIS. IN MY HEAD IT HAD SOUNDED RUDE OR SOMETHING. ON WHETHER THE NAME HE&#39;D COME UP WITH FOR THE NEW COLLECTION, SISYPHUS, HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WORD “SISSY”: “WELL, IT&#39;S FUNNY YOU SAY THAT, BECAUSE I DID FOR A WHILE REFER TO THE MEN&#39;S AND WOMEN&#39;S COLLECTIONS AS SISSY MEN AND SISSY WOMEN.” DID IT, THEN? “NO. I WAS THINKING OF KING SISYPHUS.” BUT WHY WAS HE THINKING ABOUT KING SISYPHUS? WAS IT RELATED TO A SENSE OF FRUSTRATION WITH THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY, A SENSE OF UTOPIAN URGES PLAYED OUT, PERHAPS? “I WAS THINKING ABOUT DECLINE—ECOLOGICAL DECLINE, POLITICAL DECLINE.” ALSO: “MY FATHER HAD RECENTLY DIED. WE HADN&#39;T SPOKEN IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. HE&#39;S THE ONE WHO DECIDED TO STOP TALKING. I WAS THINKING ABOUT HIM, ABOUT HIS AGGRESSIVE, ECCENTRIC GENES. I SEE IT IN MYSELF: JUDGMENT, CYNICISM.” JOHN P. “JACK” OWENS WAS, IN HIS SON&#39;S WORDS, “AN AGGRESSIVE MAN WHO NEEDED TO DOMINATE.” HE GREW UP IN ATLANTIC CITY, MET RICK&#39;S MOTHER IN MEXICO, AND MOVED TO CALIFORNIA IN THE LATE &#39;50S. THERE, IN 1961, THEY HAD RICK, A SCORPIO BABY WHO RECEIVED THE MIDDLE NAME OF SATURNINO. HIS FIRST LANGUAGE WAS SPANISH. PORTERVILLE, A FARM TOWN THAT LIES ON THE DRIED-UP BED OF OLD TULARE LAKE, WAS NOT AN ARTISTICALLY PROMISING PLACE TO GROW UP. BUT ARTISTS GROW UP IN THEIR HEADS, AND OWENS&#39;S HEAD HAD WORKING MATERIALS IN IT. JACK IMPOSED ON THE SELF-DESCRIBED “OVERLY SENSITIVE” BOY AN ECCENTRIC PROGRAM OF CULTURAL HOME-SCHOOLING, HAVING HIM READ CERTAIN CLASSICAL AUTHORS, SHOWING HIM JAPANESE PRINTS AND DRAWINGS. LED ZEPPELIN THE BOY DISCOVERED ON HIS OWN. JACK WORKED IN THE COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENT. FOUR DECADES HE SPENT DOING THAT. AND AS IS THE CASE WITH MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT JOB, HE MAINLY INTERVIEWED MEN AND WOMEN APPLYING FOR BENEFITS. MY FATHER-IN-LAW HELD THE SAME JOB FOR ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF YEARS. YOU&#39;RE BASICALLY SITTING THERE BEING LIED TO AND SCAMMED BY PEOPLE ALL DAY, PEOPLE YOU WANT TO HELP. IT&#39;S NOT THEIR FAULT. OUR WELFARE SYSTEM IS SET UP SO THAT OFTENTIMES ONLY LYING WILL GET YOU THE THINGS YOU GENUINELY NEED. BUT IT TAKES A TOLL ON THE PSYCHE. “IT EMBITTERED HIM,” OWENS SAID. “HE WAS VERY MISTRUSTFUL, WHICH ADDED TO HIS CYNICISM.” OWENS RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF HIS FATHER MANY TIMES DURING THE DAYS WE SPENT TOGETHER. THE THINGS HE SAID USUALLY CONTAINED A MIXTURE OF ANGER, RUEFULNESS, AND LOVE. IT WAS INTERESTING TO READ BACK THROUGH MY NOTEBOOK AND SEE THAT ON ALMOST EVERY PAGE, THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ONE SENTENCE ABOUT HIS FATHER. THE DEATH WAS RECENT, IS. THE SHADOW VAST. HIS FATHER, I CAME TO FEEL, HAD BEEN A KIND OF ANTI-MUSE. EVERYTHING OWENS HAD DONE WAS A DIRECT STRIKE AGAINST HIS EXAMPLE. BUT OF COURSE, LIKE ALL ANTI-MUSES, HE WAS ALSO A MUSE, EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS LAMY. SOME MUSES WE WORSHIP; OTHERS WE HAVE TO DESTROY. “HE WAS AN INTELLECTUAL BULLY,” OWENS SAID, “LOOKING FOR A CHINK IN PEOPLE&#39;S VALUE SYSTEMS. HE WAS CHARMING. HE&#39;D GAIN YOUR TRUST, THEN SAY, ‘WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ABORTION?’ HE NEEDED TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION, HE NEEDED TO ANALYZE IT, HE NEEDED TO REALLY BE THOROUGH AND HAVE FOOTNOTES.” AN OBVIOUS ISSUE BETWEEN THE TWO HAD TO DO WITH SEX. JACK OWENS HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH HOMOSEXUALITY, AND SEXUALITY, AND HIS ONLY CHILD WAS COMPLICATEDLY QUEER. “MY FATHER BRUTALIZED ME—NOT PHYSICALLY. EXCEPT ONCE,” OWENS SAID. IN THE TRADITION OF GREAT AMERICAN AUTODIDACTIC CRANKS, JACK STARTED WRITING LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY LETTERS TO THE EDITORS. OF THE PORTERVILLE POST AND THE PORTERVILLE RECORDER. TO WHOM HE ADDRESSED MULTIPLE SCREEDS AGAINST “GAY LIBERATION IDEOLOGUES” AND OTHER AGENTS OF MORAL TURPITUDE, SUCH AS THE PORTERVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH INSISTED ON SUBSCRIBING TO AND OFFERING FOR ITS PATRONS&#39; ENJOYMENT COPIES OF COSMOPOLITAN,“WHICH HAS BECOME PORNOGRAPHIC,” JACK OWENS WROTE. HE ADVISED CONCERNED READERS, “SEE RED-HOT READ, AN ONGOING FEATURE....” REACHING OUT ABOUT THIS MATTER, HE HAD CONTACTED “AN ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN, THE LIBRARIAN HERSELF, HER SUPERVISOR, THE MAYOR, THE CITY MANAGER, THE VICE MAYOR, AND AS MANY LOCAL CHURCHES AS HAVE AN E-MAIL ADDRESS...” DESPITE THIS THOROUGHNESS, “MY POSTS ARE SIMPLY IGNORED.” HE INVITED LIKE-MINDED CITIZENS TO “ACCOMPANY ME IN GOING INTO CITY HALL” AND “CONFRONT THOSE RESPONSIBLE.” THE FIRST TIME JACK SAW ONE OF OWENS&#39;S SHOWS, IN 2003, HE TOLD HIS SON, “I COULDN&#39;T BELIEVE ALL THOSE PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN COMING TO SEE YOU.” HE DIED IN 2015, AT AGE 95. OWENS SHOOK HIS HEAD. “I EXPECTED HIM TO FIND SOME LEVEL OF SERENITY,” HE SAID, BUT HE NEVER DID. EVENTUALLY, “THINGS CHANGED, AND I DEVELOPED A STRONGER VOICE THAN HIS.” DINNER CHEZ OWENS-LAMY, AT THE PLACE DU PALAIS-BOURBON. IN CASE THE OVERLAPPING NAMES ARE CONFUSING: THE PETIT PALAIS IS THE MUSEUM, WHERE I SHOWED UP LATE; THE PALAIS ROYAL IS WHERE THE STORE I VISITED IS LOCATED; THIS WAS THE PLACE DU PALAIS-BOURBON, WHERE HE LIVES. A CALIFORNIA VAMPIRE MOVES AMONG PALACES IN THE CITY OF LIGHT. YOU ENTER A BLACK GATE AND ASCEND A GIGANTIC MARBLE STAIRWAY. IT&#39;S DARK. AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS THERE&#39;S AN ALUMINUM DOOR. YOU ADVANCE UPWARD, AND AN ASSISTANT, IN BLACK RICK OWENS, SHOWS YOU INSIDE. THE BUILDING USED TO BE THE SOCIALIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS. OWENS AND LAMY SAID THE INTERIOR HAD BEEN “NASTY” WHEN THEY&#39;D FIRST MOVED IN. EVERYTHING CLUTTERED, GUNKED UP, WALLPAPERED, PANELED. THEY STRIPPED IT. THE STAIRCASE LED TO A SPACIOUS, BLOWN-OUT INTERIOR: OPEN, STARK, COLDLY WARM, LIKE LIGHT DURING AN ECLIPSE. AT DINNER, I SAT NEXT TO LAMY. SHE SMOKED CIGARETTES CONSTANTLY. MANY OF THE MINI-BIOGRAPHIES ONE CAN READ ON THE WEB OR IN MAGAZINES INCLUDE THE CLAIM THAT SHE WAS BORN IN ALGERIA OR HAS BERBER BLOOD. THIS IS WITHOUT MERIT—SHE&#39;S FROM THE JURA MOUNTAINS, NEAR THE SWISS BORDER—BUT HER CAST AND COMPLEXION ARE DARK ENOUGH TO RENDER IT PLAUSIBLE. TATTOOS ON HER FINGERS. HENNA IN HER HAIR. STRIPE OF KOHL ON HER FOREHEAD. HER BODY IS TRIM FROM BOXING, SO THAT ALTHOUGH SHE&#39;S CLOSE TO 75, SHE HAS A FIT YOUNG WOMAN&#39;S ARMS. OWENS HAD ONCE CALLED HER “AN OLD-FASHIONED SALONISTE”: “THAT&#39;S THE PART SHE LOVES—ORCHESTRATING.” ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE FROM LAMY SAT CONNIE OWENS, STILL ON THE VISIT THAT HAD GIFTED ME WITH THOSE UNFORGETTABLE COOKIES. LAMY AND CONNIE NEVER SPOKE, THAT I SAW, BUT I SENSED A STRANGE CLOSENESS BETWEEN THEM. OWENS ACTED VERY LOYAL AND LOVING TOWARD HIS MOTHER. I ASKED HER IN SPANISH WHAT IT WAS LIKE HAVING HIM FOR A SON, AND SHE SAID HE WAS THE BEST SON IN THE WORLD. ALSO AT THE TABLE THAT NIGHT WAS A RAPPER FROM ESTONIA CALLED TOMMY CASH. OWENS WAS INTO HIM. TOMMY HAD A MUSTACHE SO FAINT AND SMALL IT WAS LIKE THE MUSTACHE ON THE MONA LISA. HE WAS ROCKING HIPNESS BUT SEEMED OPEN AND FRIENDLY, TOO. TOMMY&#39;S GIRLFRIEND WAS NAMED ANNA-LISA. SHE WAS ALSO ESTONIAN. SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY HAD BASICALLY BEEN A FOREST PEOPLE, THE ESTONIANS, THE LAST HOLDOUT OF PAGANISM IN EUROPE. HER FACE WAS VAGUELY LIKE THE FACE OF AN ANIMAL I COULDN&#39;T PLACE, POSSIBLY A PORCUPINE. “DO YOU RELATE TO THAT?” I ASKED. “DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE A FOREST PERSON?” “YES,” SHE SAID. AT ONE POINT, I FOUND MYSELF DISTRACTED BY A LARGE POTTED PLANT THAT LOOMED BEHIND MY SEAT. ITS LEAVES KEPT SCRAPING MY HEAD AND OBSCURING MY VISION. EVENTUALLY, LAMY SUMMONED AN ASSISTANT/SERVANT TO COME AND TRIM THE FRONDS FROM AROUND MY HEAD. NOBODY KNEW THE TRUTH ABOUT LAMY, YOU FELT—NO ONE BUT OWENS—AND YET SHE SEEMED UTTERLY LACKING IN GUILE. YOU ARE LOOKING THROUGH SO MUCH TO SEE HER WHEN YOU SIT BESIDE HER. THE MAKEUP, THE RINGS, THE TATTOOING, THE HENNA, THE MOTIONS OF HER HANDS, WRISTS A-CLATTER, IT&#39;S ALL A KIND OF COLORFUL SHAKING, BUT AT THE VERY CENTER ARE THESE EYES OF A COLOR I&#39;D NEVER SEEN BEFORE. BASALTIC, BUT I&#39;VE SEEN BASALTIC EYES. THESE WERE DIFFERENT AND DARKER, AT LEAST IN THAT LIGHT. GUNMETAL. THEY&#39;RE THE SECRET OF HER SEDUCTION, THAT MUCH WAS CLEAR. BY THE TIME YOU SEE THROUGH EVERYTHING AND FIND THE EYES, YOU&#39;RE DONE. SHE HAS SEEN YOU. I ROLLED A JOINT, AND SHE ASKED ME HOW I ROLL THEM: “WHAT RATIO?” I ANSWERED, “NINETY-TWO PERCENT WEED AND EIGHT PERCENT TOBACCO.” SHE TOLD ME THAT IF I REVERSED THE RATIO EXACTLY, SHE MIGHT SMOKE ONE. SO I DID, AND SHE DID. TOMMY ASKED ME TO TAKE A “FAMILY PORTRAIT” OF HIM AND ANNA-LISA WITH RICK AND MICHÈLE. OWENS HARANGUED ME AS I MOVED AROUND WITH TOMMY&#39;S PHONE, TRYING TO GET A GOOD ANGLE. “COME ON, FLOW WITH IT,” HE SAID. “DON&#39;T BE LAZY. TRY TO FEEL IT.” I MOVED FASTER, LAUGHING. “OKAY,” OWENS SAID ABRUPTLY, “THAT&#39;S ENOUGH.” LATER IN THE EVENING, TOMMY SHOWED US SOME VIDEOS. ANNA-LISA HAD ART-DIRECTED THEM. THEY WERE CAPTIVATING. “I REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC,” OWENS WHISPERED TO ME AT ONE POINT. “LISTEN TO THE MUSIC.” HE WASN&#39;T DISSING THE RAPPING. HE JUST ESPECIALLY LIKED THE MUSIC. AND WHEN I TUNED IN TO IT, I HEARD HOW FRESH IT WAS. HIGH-TECH BUT RAW. SPACIOUS, DECEPTIVELY MELODIC. (WEEKS LATER, OWENS INVITED TOMMY TO WALK FOR HIM ON THE RUNWAY IN PARIS TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF AN INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF ONE OF HIS BEST SONGS, “P SSY MONEY WEED.”) MY TURN CAME, AND I MADE THEM WATCH A DANCE VIDEO I&#39;D BEEN OBSESSED WITH, KHALEYA GRAHAM DANCING TO KENDRICK LAMAR&#39;S “HUMBLE.” I HOPE IT FREAKED THEM OUT. IT MAY HAVE BUMMED OUT TOMMY CASH SLIGHTLY. HE MAY HAVE FELT LIKE I WOULD FEEL IF I WERE TO DO A READING AND THEN SOMEONE WERE TO GO UP AND READ SOME CHEKHOV. BUT I REFLECTED THAT IF SO, IT COULD BE USEFUL. PERHAPS IT WOULD PUSH HIM. I TOLD TOMMY I WOULD PUT HIM IN MY STORY, AND HE GOT VERY HAPPY AND SORT OF WATERY-EYED, LIKE, “LIFE IS MAGICAL,” EVEN THOUGH HE WAS ALREADY GETTING FAMOUS. HE DIDN&#39;T NEED ME. OWENS DIDN&#39;T SPEAK MUCH THAT NIGHT, BUT AT ONE POINT HE SAID, “MICHÈLE, ISN&#39;T JOHN CHARMING?” “YES, RICK. HE IS VERY CHARMING.” “YEAH? WELL, HE&#39;S A JOURNALIST, AND HE&#39;S GOING TO TWIST EVERY WORD WE SAY TO HIS OWN ENDS. DON&#39;T FORGET.” “OKAY, RICK.” AS WE WERE GETTING READY TO LEAVE, I SAW SOMETHING AMAZING. THERE WAS A LONG, HIGH HALLWAY MIRROR, A MIRROR 30 FEET LONG. LAMY WAS WALKING ALONG IT, ON HER WAY BACK FROM THE BATHROOM, AND MAKING HERSELF LOOK DELIBERATELY UGLY. STICKING OUT HER STOMACH AS IF SHE WERE FAT. LOWERING HER CHIN AS IF SHE HAD MULTIPLE CHINS. CHANGING HER EXPRESSION TO BE SAD AND HEAVY-HANGING. AND WALKING IN A STILTED WAY, WITH SHORT STEPS. AS IF SHE WERE SAYING, “YES, I COULD BE THIS. WE COULD ALL BE ANYTHING.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

IN PARIS. SECOND FLOOR OF THE PALAIS BOURBON. THE DESIGNER RICK OWENS, DRESSED IN A BLACK TANK TOP, BLACK WIDE-CUT PANTS, AND CALF-HIGH SNEAKER BOOTS, PUTS ON A PAIR OF EYEGLASSES AND LEANS TOWARD A LARGE SCREEN. HIS RAVEN-COLORED HAIR FLOWS OVER HIS SHOULDERS, WHICH ARE PINCHED FORWARD. IT IS DECEMBER, AND A COOL NIGHT PRESSES ON FRENCH WINDOWS NEAR HIS DESK. “I WAS THINKING ON THE TOE, SO IT ALMOST EXTENDS THE TOE AND THE SIDES OF THE FOOT ARE STRAIGHT,” HE SAYS SLOWLY. HE IS SKYPE CONFERENCING WITH HIS HEAD MEN’S PATTERNMAKER AND STUDIO COORDINATOR IN CONCORDIA, IN ITALY, WHERE HE SPENDS EVERY THIRD WEEK DRAPING GARMENTS. THEY ARE STUDYING THE PROTOTYPE FOR A SHOE IN HIS UPCOMING COLLECTION: BOOTLIKE AND NARROW WITH A STRUCTURED PLATFORM ELEMENT COMING OFF THE TOE. HIS BROW IS FURROWED; THE DETAILING ISN’T QUITE RIGHT. “IT’S MORE A FAN SHAPE THAN I WAS THINKING,” HE EXPLAINS. “AND REMEMBER THE PLASTIC ELEMENTS WITH THE HOLE YOU PUT THE SCREW IN? I WOULD LOVE TO DUPLICATE THAT SO THE SCREWS WILL BE VISIBLE.” IT IS AN UNUSUAL REQUEST, BUT OWENS PIONEERS AN UNUSUAL SORT OF LUXURY, AS CAPTURED IN HIS OFFICE DECOR: THE WALLS RAW AND MOSTLY BARE, THE FLOOR CONCRETE, THE GRAY CUSHIONS LIVED-IN AND PILLED. SINCE SOON AFTER HE MOVED TO FRANCE FROM CALIFORNIA, IN 2003, THIS HAS BEEN OWENS’S UNLIKELY VERSION OF A PALACE. THERE ARE LAMPS SHAPED LIKE CHEMISTRY EQUIPMENT, A HORST EGON KALINOWSKI SCULPTURE. OPERA—ONE OF HIS FEW INDULGED PASSIONS—SOARS IN THE BACKGROUND. GIVEN SUCH MIXED SIGNIFIERS, OWENS CAN SEEM AS MUCH A CIPHER NOW, AT 57, AS DURING HIS FIRST, VOGUE-SPONSORED 2002 SHOW, WHICH EARNED HIM THE CFDA PERRY ELLIS AWARD. WITH HIS HEADBANGER HAIR, SINEWY TORSO, AND ALL-PERVADING UNDERWORLD PALETTE (OWENS, FINDING COLOR A DISTRACTION, EDITS EVEN COLOR DESIGNS IN GRAYSCALE), HE IS THE WEATHERED IMAGE OF A GOTH-ROCKER ADONIS—ONE KNOWN FOR EERIE CULTURAL PRESCIENCE. OWENS’S SPRING 2016 COLLECTION FAMOUSLY FEATURED RUNWAY MODELS BOUND TO OTHER MODELS, WHOM THEY CARRIED OVER THEIR SHOULDERS—AN ALMOST ORACULAR WINDOW INTO WOMEN’S GROWING SOLIDARITY AND STRENGTH—WHILE HIS SPRING 2019 SHOW, HELD DURING THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS, CENTERED ON A WITCHY PYRE. “I DON’T FOLLOW POLITICS SPECIFICALLY, BUT WHO CAN NOT BE CONSCIOUS OF CULTURAL DISCOMFORT? CLOTHES ARE ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND HOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING ALONG WITH EACH OTHER, HOW THEY WANT TO SAY WHAT THEY ARE,” HE SAYS. “WE’VE ALL BEEN FEELING WOMEN’S FRUSTRATION.” EVEN SO, HE RESISTS PROGRAMMATIC READINGS OF HIS WORK. “WHEN YOU SEE THOSE GARMENTS IN A STORE, ARE THEY GOING TO EXPRESS WOMEN’S FRUSTRATION?” HE LAUGHS. “IT’S ALL MORE VAGUE THAN THAT.” AT SUCH MOMENTS, A DIFFERENT DESIGNER SEEMS TO COME INTO VIEW. DESPITE HIS REPUTATION AS A RIMBAUDIAN ICONOCLAST, OWENS WAS NO WUNDERKIND—HE WAS 40 WHEN HE FIRST SHOWED ON THE RUNWAY—AND HE CONDUCTS HIS AFFAIRS WITH THE PATIENCE AND EQUIPOISE OF AN OLD HAND. “TO ME, GRACIOUSNESS IS PARAMOUNT,” HE SAYS. LAST NOVEMBER, HE HOSTED SOME 120 PEOPLE FOR A WARM, FAMILIAL THANKSGIVING DINNER. IN CONVERSATION, HE IS RAW AND COURTLY AT THE SAME TIME. (A TYPICAL GREETING: “I’M JUST GOING TO PISS, AND THEN WE CAN PROMENADE!”) “MY FATHER WAS VERY CONFRONTATIONAL AND AN INTELLECTUAL BULLY,” HE SAYS. “MY MOM WAS A PEACEMAKER WHO WANTED TO MAKE EVERYONE COMFORTABLE.” HE SEES HIMSELF AS BEING CAUGHT IN BETWEEN. “THERE’S A HUGE ADOLESCENT SIDE TO ME THAT I CAN’T GROW OUT OF. BUT I FEEL THERE’S A WAY TO TALK ABOUT FLEXIBILITY. I’M PROPOSING OTHER OPTIONS FOR BEAUTY—BUT IT’S A PROPOSAL, NOT A MANIFESTO.” “HE COMPLAINS THAT I BRING CHAOS TO HIS WELL-PACED WORLD,” HIS WIFE, ARTIST AND SOMETIME COLLABORATOR OF NEARLY THREE DECADES, MICHÈLE LAMY, SAYS. SHE INITIALLY HIRED HIM AS A PATTERNMAKER FOR HER OWN FASHION LINE; AFTER HE BEGAN SELLING HIS OWN GARMENTS, HE WORKED OPPOSITE HER RESTAURANT LES DEUX CAFÉ, ON LAS PALMAS AVENUE IN LOS ANGELES. “IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THEIR LIVING ROOM,” SAYS ARIANNE PHILLIPS, AN INFLUENTIAL HOLLYWOOD COSTUME DESIGNER WHO WAS A CLOSE FRIEND OF OWENS AND LAMY. “IT ENDED UP BECOMING THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE FOR ALL THINGS CULTURAL AND HAPPENING IN L.A.” IN PARIS, OWENS’S ENERGIES ARE FOCUSED OUTWARD, AND HE FOLLOWS AN OBSESSIVELY CONTROLLED SCHEDULE: HE WAKES AT EIGHT AND ANSWERS OVERNIGHT EMAILS FROM BED; ARRIVES BY ELEVEN AT THE OFFICE ADJOINING HIS HOME; LUNCHES AT TWO; RECHARGES WITH A NAP; WORKS THROUGH THE EVENING; VISITS THE GYM; AND GOES TO DINNER AROUND TEN, OFTEN AT THE LOW-KEY BRASSERIE A FEW STEPS FROM HIS DOOR. “I’M LIKE THIS SEDATE GUY WHO LIVES IN A WORLD OF ABSTINENCE AND THE GYM,” HE SAYS. DUE TO THIS MONKLIKE REGIMEN OF WORK AND REST, OWENS—DESPITE BEING ACCOUNTABLE TO A SMALL EMPIRE OF NINE NAMESAKE STORES, A BUSY E-COMMERCE SITE, MULTIPLE DIFFUSION LINES, AND A FURNITURE BRAND—FEELS FRESH AT A RAGGED-RUNNING MOMENT IN FASHION. (IT MAY HELP THAT HE’S ACCOUNTABLE LARGELY TO HIMSELF: RICK OWENS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW REMAINING MAJOR INDEPENDENT LABELS HEADQUARTERED IN PARIS.) “I’M NOT TORTURED BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO FAST. I LIKE IT FAST,” OWENS SAYS. HE’S SOMETHING OF A CLASSICIST WHO SEES HIS WORK IN DIALOGUE WITH ARCHETYPES OF HUMAN DRESS THAT HAVE LASTED THOUSANDS OF YEARS: ARMOR, THEATER, NATURALISM. “IT MAKES YOU FEEL A LITTLE INSIGNIFICANT, IN A REASSURING WAY.” AND AS A STUDENT OF CYCLICAL HISTORY, HE’S LEARNED TO TRUST THAT ALL ARTFUL AND WELL-MADE THINGS EVENTUALLY RETURN WITH A NEW LIFE. SO FAR, HE HAS BEEN RIGHT. BECAUSE HIS DESIGNS AREN’T CONVENTIONALLY GLAMOROUS, OWENS IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS HAVING A “CULT FOLLOWING.” BUT HIS APPEAL IS ASTONISHINGLY WIDESPREAD, EXTENDING ACROSS AGE AND GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, HIS GARMENTS BECAME OBJECTS OF DESIRE AMONG WOMEN WHO RECOGNIZED THEM AS ROMANTIC BUT UNPREENING, FLATTERINGLY PRECISE YET CURIOUSLY COZY. “HE HAD A SOPHISTICATED DESIGN AESTHETIC, AND HE USED UNCOMMON FABRICS THAT WERE NOT CONSIDERED LUXURY AT THAT TIME,” PHILLIPS SAYS. “I THINK OF A WOMAN IN L.A. WHO DOESN’T DRESS UP TO GO OUT AT NIGHT—MAYBE SHE CHANGES HER SHOES AND PUTS SOME LIPSTICK ON. IT WAS UNPRETENTIOUS AND ELEGANT AT THE SAME TIME. YOU COULD STILL HAVE A PERSONALITY WHEN YOU WORE THEM.” HIS EARLY MEN’S COLLECTIONS, MEANWHILE, HELPED TO DEFINE A MOODY NEW AESTHETIC FOR THE GAY BODY, NEITHER PRIM NOR PECTORAL. (OWENS IS BISEXUAL.) AT THE START OF THE DECADE, KANYE WEST BEGAN WEARING RICK OWENS AROUND TOWN, INTRODUCING A NEW GENERATION AND AN EVEN BROADER AUDIENCE TO HIS DISTINCTIVE STYLE: THOSE PERFECTLY FORMED COATS, SOMEHOW AT ONCE BAGGY AND CONSTRUCTED; THOSE MASTERFULLY DRAPED DRESSES, BOTH VERSATILE AND REFINED. (WEST ADMIRES OWENS’S SPARE FURNITURE, TOO—HE HAS BOASTED OF OWNING A “PETRIFIED RICK OWENS TABLE.”) THE FRESH WAVE OF COOL HAS NURTURED NEW COLLABORATIONS. IN JANUARY, AS PART OF A FALL MEN’S COLLECTION THAT, WITH ITS NAPA SHEARLING COATS, PLATFORM BOOTS, AND SELVAGE DENIM, LOOKED BACK TO THE DESIGNER LARRY LEGASPI, HE ALSO LOOKED FORWARD, UNVEILING A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ECOLOGICALLY CONSCIOUS SNEAKER BRAND VEJA. AND HE MADE HIS MUSICAL DEBUT—NOT THE SORT ONE MIGHT EXPECT—WITH VOCALS ON A TRACK BY THE ESTONIAN RAPPER TOMMY CASH. “BLACK-MAGIC F CKBOY, NECROMANTIC SAVAGE, SUPERNATURAL DISTORTION,” OWENS’S CONTRIBUTION GOES. NOW, AS A TEMPESTUOUS TENOR SOLO BECOMES A SOPRANO ARIA IN THE BACKGROUND, OWENS TURNS HIS SKYPE CALL TO KNITWEAR. “THE LAST JOGGING PANTS THAT WE LOOKED AT WERE GREAT,” HE SAYS. “BUT PERSONALLY, I’D WANT THEM WITH CASHMERE.” “I CAN KNIT THEM IN CASHMERE AND THE VISCOSE,” OFFERS A YOUNG DESIGNER, MARCO LISA, ONSCREEN. (NORMALLY, OWENS BESTOWS NICKNAMES ON COLLEAGUES: ANNE VAN DEN BOSSCHE, HIS RIGHT HAND FOR COLLECTIONS, IS VANDENDUST—“DUST” BEING A SIGNATURE OWENS COLOR—WHILE ANNA-PHILIPPA WOLF, HIS ASSISTANT, BECAME FIRST ANNA LUPO, FROM THE ITALIAN, AND EVENTUALLY AL.) “FOR RUNWAY, IN TERMS OF COLOR, NOW WE HAVE BLACK, RUST”—ANOTHER OWENS HUE—“AND GRAY...” “THAT SOUNDS GREAT!” OWENS SAYS, BRIGHTENING AS IF HEARING OF THE IDEA FOR THE FIRST TIME. “I LIKE GRAY.” BEFORE THE GRAY OWENS, THERE WAS THE BEIGE ONE: “A MILD KID IN A CONSERVATIVE TOWN,” HE RECALLS. PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, WHERE HE GREW UP AS THE SON OF A MEXICAN WOMAN AND AN AMERICAN MAN, IS LANDLOCKED AND STRAITLACED. AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, HE LEFT FOR THE NEAREST CITY: LOS ANGELES. HE STARTED OUT STUDYING PAINTING AND BEGAN TO REINVENT HIMSELF, PHYSICALLY—HIS HAIR IS NATURALLY CURLY—AND IN HABIT, VOGUEING AND CLUBBING AT NIGHT. “THE IDEA OF COMPLETELY THROWING YOURSELF INTO EMOTION AND DRAMA APPEALED TO ME,” HE SAYS. “SO I DID, IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.” OWENS HAS NOT VISITED LOS ANGELES ONCE SINCE MOVING TO PARIS IN 2003. ALTHOUGH HIS CREATIVE LIFE BEGAN THERE, IN A TINY STUDIO WITH ONE SEAMSTRESS, CALIFORNIA IS OVERSHADOWED FOR HIM WITH MEMORIES OF HIS YOUNGER SELF. “I’M JUST REMINDED OF THE WEAK ME THERE, NOT COMPLETELY DEVELOPED,” HE SAYS. THERE WERE DRUGS AND BOOZE AND A DISORDERLINESS HE IS KEEN TO LEAVE BEHIND. INSTEAD OF REPORTING FROM THE WEST COAST, HE HAS BECOME FASHION’S LEADING CALIFORNIA EXPATRIATE, FILTERING A CLEAN, CONSTRUCTED COASTAL STYLE THROUGH OLD-WORLD AUSTERITY, WORKING THE EDGY AND THE ANCIENT TOWARD A BALANCE POINT. VOGUE’S LONGTIME WEST COAST EDITOR, LISA LOVE, WHO HELPED HIM PRODUCE AN EARLY PROTO-SHOW IN A TINY BLACK-BOX SPACE AT LES DEUX CAFÉ, SAYS SHE STILL SEES THE THREAD OF THAT L.A. WORLD—“A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD THAT HAD ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE CHARACTERS FINDING A NEW FREEDOM”—IN HIS RECENT WORK. “THERE’S ALWAYS A THREAD OF A STORY THAT GOES BACK IN TIME TO THAT BLACK BOX,” SHE SAYS. “FOR ME, IT’S ALL THE T-SHIRTS, THE ANDROGYNOUS PEOPLE . . . THE LENGTH OF THE SLEEVE, WHICH COMES OVER ALL THE FINGERS AT THE END.” DESPITE HAVING LIVED IN PARIS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS WITH A FRANCOPHONE WIFE, OWENS PURPORTS NOT TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE (IT IS LIKELY THAT HE UNDERSTANDS A LITTLE MORE THAN HE LETS ON), AND SETTLED IN THE SEVENTH ARRONDISSEMENT BECAUSE IT STRIKES HIM AS APPROPRIATELY IMPERIOUS: IT MAKES HIM FEEL LIKE AN “ALIEN,” WHICH HE FINDS COMFORTING. “HE SOMEHOW FINDS A WAY IN PARIS TO PUT HIS HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD FEEL IN A CONTEXT OF OLD WORLD CULTURE,” LAMY SAYS. “HE HAS A CALIFORNIA UTOPIAN APPROACH TO WHAT HE COULD BUILD.” TO A GENERATION THAT DIDN’T EXPERIENCE FIRSTHAND THE DARK, LEATHERY, VAGUELY APOCALYPTIC CASUAL CHIC OF THAT SCENE, RICK OWENS REMAINS ITS STRONGEST VOICE, EXPORTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOTH TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FLY OUT RIPE AVOCADOS FROM PARIS TO CONCORDIA, AND HE REMAINS, IN HIS DISTINCTIVE WAY, A BEACH BUM, SPENDING HIS SUMMERS ON AN ISLAND NEAR VENICE, ON THE SAND WITH BOOKS AND BOOKS AND BOOKS. (HE DEVOURS BIOGRAPHIES.) THE NEXT MORNING, HIS OFFICE COUCH IS THICKLY STREWN WITH OPEN BOOKS ON INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND ART: CONSTANTIN BRANCUSI, MICHAEL HEIZER. HE’S BEEN STUDYING THEIR CURVES. “I WAS LOOKING FOR MY KEYS, BUT I DON’T THINK I NEED KEYS,” HE SAYS, DELIGHTEDLY DOFFING HIS GLASSES AND PULLING ON A BLACK PARKA TO MATCH A STOCKING CAP ON HIS HEAD: THE MORE PARED DOWN, THE BETTER. OUTSIDE, HE HEADS TOWARD THE NEARBY CHURCH, SAINTE CLOTILDE, A NINETEENTH-CENTURY BASILICA WITH TWIN GOTHIC SPIRES. ON THE WAY, A YOUNG MAN IN A BLACK THREE-PIECE SUIT STOPS, WIDE-EYED. “RICK OWENS? I’M A VERY BIG FAN OF YOU! CAN I TAKE A PICTURE?” “I’M VERY GOOD AT SELFIES,” OWENS OFFERS. “I LIKE YOUR SHOES!” THE YOUNG MAN CRIES ECSTATICALLY. “I LIKE YOUR SHOES,” OWENS REPLIES. &quot;I WOULD LIKE YOUR COLLABORATION,” THE YOUNG MAN CONTINUES, SEIZING THE MOMENT. “THE SHOES WERE MADE IN AFRICA. MY GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA—I SPEAK THE VERNACULAR!” OWENS URGES HIM TO GET IN TOUCH ON HIS WEBSITE. AFTER HEADING OFF, THE YOUNG MAN RUNS BACK AND PULLS OFF HIS LEATHER BACKPACK. “THIS BAG IS MADE IN AFRICA. I OFFER IT FOR YOU.” OWENS DEMURS, BUT HE INSISTS. “I’M VERY PASSIONNÉ FOR RICK OWENS,” HE ADDS SWEETLY, AND RUNS AWAY AGAIN BEFORE OWENS CAN HAND THE BAG BACK. HE IS TOUCHED. BUT ALSO: HE IS SQUEAMISH ABOUT BAGS—OR, MORE SPECIFICALLY, BAGGAGE. HE DESIGNED HIS COAT TO HAVE TWELVE POCKETS, SO AS NOT TO NEED TO CARRY STUFF IN HIS HANDS. HE DRAGS THE GIFT, A LITTLE GRUDGINGLY, INSIDE. THE BASILICA IS VAULTED, GORGEOUS, GRAY. OWENS WAS RAISED CATHOLIC, THEN FELL OFF. BUT HE HAS STUDIED THESE SPIRES FROM HIS BEDROOM WINDOW SINCE ARRIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE CHURCH BECAME THE PLACE HE WENT WITH HIS VISITING PARENTS TO DISCUSS SERIOUS MATTERS. “I JUST LIKE THIS SPACE BEING A PART OF MY LIFE,” HE SAYS. “WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, RELIGION WAS MY FIRST EXAMPLE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN EXOTICISM AND THE MORALITY OF BEHAVIOR. THERE WAS GLAMOUR, BUT THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE OF HIGHER PURPOSE.” LAST YEAR, HE HAD A BOLD IDEA: WHAT IF HE HELD A FASHION SHOW HERE IN SAINTE CLOTILDE? IT WOULDN’T BE IRREVERENT, HE THOUGHT, BECAUSE IT HAD BECOME HIS CHURCH—A DEEPLY PERSONAL, SACRED PLACE—AND HE FELT DULY PROTECTIVE OF IT. AFTER MOUNTING YEARS OF LAVISH SHOWS IN GRAND VENUES AROUND PARIS, HE LIKED THE IDEA OF DOING SOMETHING SMALLER AND LESS DECADENT. “I’M THINKING I COULD BE PAYING FOR SOME YOUTH SHELTER INSTEAD OF RENTALS FOR THESE BIG PLACES,” HE SAID. OWENS APPROACHED THE VICAR. “HE WAS INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING COLLABORATIVE, LIKE WITH THE ORGAN, WHICH IS BEAUTIFUL. HE WANTS TO INCLUDE SOME SPOKEN WORD. I THOUGHT, THAT MIGHT BE NICE.” AFTER MAKING A SLOW TOUR OF THE CHURCH—OWENS LOVES THE DARK, TORN TAPESTRIES IN THE BACK—HE HEADS OUTSIDE AGAIN, BOUND FOR A COUPLE OF ANTIQUES VENDORS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IN ESPACE EMMANUEL EYRAUD, HE EXAMINES AN EBONY BOX BY ALEXANDRE NOLL. “HOW MUCH IS THIS? IT’S GOING TO SURPRISE ME, ISN’T IT?” HE ASKS THE SALESWOMAN. THEN IT’S ON TO THE GALERIE J. KUGEL, ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SHOWROOMS IN PARIS. “A LOT OF THE PIERRE BERGE AND YVES SAINT LAURENT COLLECTION CAME FROM HERE,” HE SAYS AS HE ENTERS THE MAIN HALL. “EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE.” OWENS HAS BEGUN TO COLLECT ANTIQUES HIMSELF, BUT WITH RULES. HE LOVES ART NOUVEAU. “THERE’S A SOMBER SENSUALITY TO IT, WHICH IS KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING I MAKE, WHICH IS BRUTALIST, REDUCTIONIST, AND ABOUT CONTROL,” HE EXPLAINS. “COLLAPSE AND SENSUALITY—THAT’S WHAT ART NOUVEAU REPRESENTS TO ME.” FOR THIS REASON, HE FEELS THAT HE MUST LIMIT THE NUMBER OF ART NOUVEAU PIECES IN HIS OFFICE AND HIS LIVING SPACES. “IT’S LIKE SENSUALITY CONTROLLED,” HE SAYS. HE BUYS NOTHING. RECENTLY, HE SAYS, HE REDISCOVERED THE LOUVRE AFTER FINDING THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BYPASS THE TOURIST LINES—NOW HE LIKES TO SLIP IN FOR A FEW MINUTES EN ROUTE TO HIS GYM. HEADING THERE NOW, HE STOPS IN THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES FOR A DOUBLE ESPRESSO—THERE’S A CAFE BY A DUCK POND HE LIKES. OWENS TRIES TO PACE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROUGH THE DAY: IT’S A WAY OF FOCUSING HIS FINITE ENERGY. “IT TOOK SUCH A LONG TIME TO GAIN CONTROL, AND THE CONTROL IS JUST BARELY COVERING UP THE ART NOUVEAU INSIDE ME,” HE EXPLAINS. “WHEN I’M PUTTING TOGETHER A COLLECTION, I’M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE EMOTION, BECAUSE THAT I CAN’T HELP—IT WILL LEAK THROUGH THE CRACKS OF MY CONTROL.” AS HE SPEAKS, A TINY BIRD LEAPS ONTO THE TABLE AND TOWARD HIM, CHIRPING. HE GIGGLES, DELIGHTED AT THIS ATTENTION, AND IT’S A STRANGELY MOVING SCENE: A COOL BREEZE DRAWING UP FROM THE POND, THE BIRD CHIRPING AS IF WITH A MESSAGE, AND RICK OWENS, THE CULT DESIGNER WITH THE ROCKER HAIR AND THE DISSIPATED PAST, LOOKING LIKE SAINT FRANCIS, AN IMAGE OF OPENNESS AND, OF ALL THINGS, PEACE. EVERY NOW AND THEN, THESE DAYS, OWENS STILL LETS HIMSELF GO OUT DANCING: HE TAKES A MIDNIGHT NAP, GETS DRESSED, HAS A COFFEE, AND GOES OUT, SOBER, TOWARD FOUR, WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS COASTING TOWARD THE END OF A WILD NIGHT. “IT’S A WONDERFUL, VERY LUCID EXPERIENCE,” HE SAYS. NOW THAT IS WHAT HE SEEKS. “SATURDAY NIGHTS USED TO BE ABOUT EXCESS AND EUPHORIA,” OWENS SAYS. “BUT THIS LAST SATURDAY NIGHT I WAS ALONE IN THIS EMPTY WHITE FACTORY IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN CONCORDIA, FINALIZING THIS MENSWEAR COLLECTION. AND I WAS THINKING, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE GLAMOROUS OR EUPHORIC THAN THIS?” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

WITH HIS ANGULAR FEATURES, LONG, STRAIGHT BLACK HAIR, AND HIS GYM-CHISELED FRAME COCOONED IN HIS OWN GRECIAN-GALACTIC READY-TO-WEAR, RICK OWENS IS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD. THE ICONOCLASTIC DESIGNER HAS BEEN CREATING VISUAL FEASTS - FASHION AS SCULPTURE, CLOTHES AS ARMOR - FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS, AND TODAY HAS A REPUTATION IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT HOVERS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CULT MAINSTAY AND BOUNDARY-PUSHING ELDER STATESMAN. HIS VISION OF GLAMOUR IS UNEXPECTED AND STARK, YET AT THE SAME TIME, IT TRANSCENDS TYPICAL IDEAS OF BEAUTY TO PRESENT SOMETHING DARKER AND TRANSFIXING; A MORE INCLUSIVE AND EXCITING VISION OF WHAT FASHION CAN ASK OF ITS WEARER. OWENS WAS BORN IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA AND STUDIED PAINTING AND SCULPTURE IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE MOVING INTO THE WORLD OF FASHION DESIGN, LEARNING PATTERN MAKING AND DRAPING AND CREATING A READY-TO-WEAR COLLECTION IN 1994. IN 2002, HE PRESENTED HIS FIRST COLLECTION AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK, A MANIFESTO OF MOODY GLAMOUR AND HARD-EDGED ROCK ’N’ ROLL COOL THAT HAS BEEN AT THE HEART OF HIS WORK EVER SINCE. HE SUBSEQUENTLY LEFT THE WEST COAST FOR PARIS WHERE HIS COMPANY IS CURRENTLY BASED. IN RECENT YEARS, HIS WORK WITH ITS LANGUID SILHOUETTES, DRAMATIC DRAPING, AND ASYMMETRICAL LINES HAVE MADE HIS RUNWAY SHOWS THE MOST ANTICIPATED OF THE PARIS LEG OF FASHION WEEK. HIS LOOK BOTH FORETOLD THE CURRENT MANIA FOR STREETWEAR AND THE SPORTY AESTHETIC CURRENTLY DOMINATING THE INDUSTRY BUT ALSO PUSHED IT FORWARD IN AN INTELLIGENT, EXPANSIVE WAY. ONE THING HE’S ALWAYS DONE, THOUGH, IS CREATE A LOOK THAT IS UTTERLY UNIQUE AND COMPLETELY RECOGNIZABLE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW? I’M FINISHING THE PRE-COLLECTION AND STARTING ON MEN’S RUNWAY. THAT MEANS STARTING TO LOOK AT THE FIRST SHAPES. I ALWAYS ASK TO HAVE THE FACTORY PREPARE TWELVE SHAPES WE’VE DONE IN THE PAST, MADE OF MUSLIN, AND THAT’S WHERE I CHANGE THEM, ALTER THEM, CORRUPT THEM, DEGENERATE THEM, RAPE THEM. I GUESS RAPE ISN’T A POLITICALLY CORRECT THING TO SAY IN A MAGAZINE, IS IT? I WANT TO F CK THEM UP. WELL, IF THAT’S WHAT YOU FEEL YOU DO, THEN YOU CAN SAY IT. YEAH, BUT THAT’S NOT WHAT A MAGAZINE WANTS TO HEAR. BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN YOU CAN’T SAY IT! SO, THEN, WOULD YOU SAY THIS THE MOST EXCITING PART OF YOUR DESIGN PROCESS? YEAH, IT REALLY IS. THERE ARE REALLY DISTINCT STAGES. THIS IS THE EXCITING PART BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS FRESH AND IT HAS POTENTIAL TO BE THE BEST COLLECTION EVER IN THE UNIVERSE. AND THEN LATER, IN DECEMBER, I’M GOING TO HAVE RESULTS AND IT’S GONNA BE A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE EVERYTHING LOOKS STUPID AND NOTHING CAME OUT THE WAY I WANTED IT TO. THEN IT’S ALL ABOUT JUST SCRAMBLING TO SAVE THAT. AND THEN IN JANUARY, THERE IS THE WEEK BEFORE THE SHOW WHERE I HAVE AGREED TO STAY AWAY FROM THE FACTORY AND LET THEM WORK IN PEACE, BECAUSE I’LL JUST GET IN THEIR WAY AND START CHANGING THINGS. THEN IT ARRIVES ON THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE SHOW, BECAUSE I SHOW ON THURSDAY. THEY’LL PUT IT IN MY OFFICE AND I’LL GO TO THE GYM AND THEN I’LL LOOK AT IT WHEN I GET BACK BECAUSE I’M ALWAYS IN A BETTER MOOD, A LITTLE MORE SERENE OR MAYBE IN A MORE TOLERANT MOOD. I’LL LOOK AT IT, USUALLY, AND I’LL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT WE PULLED IT TOGETHER AND THERE’S ENOUGH STUFF TO EDIT AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY. AND THAT’S USUALLY HOW IT WORKS. SO RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING HAS HUGE POTENTIAL. IT’S A BIG, MAGICAL, SPARKLING, EMPTY CANVAS AND ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. IS THAT EVER INTIMIDATING? YOU KNOW, IT’S REALLY INTIMIDATING, ACTUALLY. I GO TO DEPARTMENT STORES AND I THINK: HOW ON EARTH CAN WE EXPECT PEOPLE TO CHOOSE OUR STUFF, SO WE CAN SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS, WHEN THERE’S ALL OF THIS GOOD STUFF? I EVEN WONDER HOW ARE THEY GOING TO SELL ALL OF THIS STUFF IN THREE MONTHS BEFORE IT HAS TO GO ON SALE. THAT PART ALWAYS UNSETTLES ME. ALSO, IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE BIT MORALLY WRONG. IT SEEMS LIKE EXCESS AND WASTE. BUT MY SOLACE IS THAT PEOPLE COMMUNICATING AND ENJOYING BEAUTY IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE’RE PUT ON EARTH, IT’S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO WHILE WE’RE HERE. SO IT’S A LITTLE MORAL TUSSLE THAT I HAVE BECAUSE I HATE BEING SOMEBODY THAT IS JUST CLUTTERING THE WORLD. I’M KIND OF TEETERING BETWEEN MAKING AN HONORABLE CONTRIBUTION AND BEING A TOXIC WASTE. I’VE READ THAT YOU TRY TO RESIST CERTAIN CLICHÉS AND CODES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE IN FASHION DESIGN. DO YOU FIND THAT JUSTIFIES CONTINUING TO CREATE SEASON AFTER SEASON? YEAH, IT DOES BECAUSE ALSO, BY DOING THAT, I’M PROMOTING, IN A VERY MINUSCULE WAY, A SENSE OF TOLERANCE. I’M MAKING SUGGESTIONS THAT WE THINK OUTSIDE NARROW, MAYBE BIGOTED, ATTITUDES AND WE CONSIDER BEING MORE GENEROUS AND WE CONSIDER OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT SO OBVIOUS. I DO FEEL THAT’S SOMETHING POSITIVE THAT I CAN DO. BUT WHAT YOU MAKE IS SO UNIQUE, IT’S UNLIKE WHAT MOST OTHER DESIGNERS ARE MAKING. DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT WHAT YOU CREATE? OH YEAH, THERE’S A LOT OF BULLSHIT OUT THERE. THERE’S GOOD STUFF. THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND THERE’S SOME BEAUTIFULLY MADE THINGS, AND THERE ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE THINGS OUT THERE. IT’S NOT LIKE I THINK THAT I’M DOING SOMETHING THAT’S UNIQUE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING UNIQUE THINGS. THERE’S BEAUTIFUL THINGS OUT THERE AND THAT’S WHAT MAKES IT UNSETTLING. LIKE GOD, THIS STUFF IS REALLY GOOD. WHY WOULD THEY BUY MINE? IS THAT THOUGHT IN YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU’RE DESIGNING? WELL, IT’S A FUNNY THING. THERE’S TWO MINDS THAT I HAVE TO CONSIDER. ONE, IS THIS A LOGICAL EXTENSION AND EVOLUTION OF WHAT I’VE DONE BEFORE? I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS NOT TOO OUTLANDISH AND THAT PEOPLE WILL RESPOND TO IT, THAT PEOPLE CAN IDENTIFY AS COMING FOR ME AND THEREFORE HAVE A GOOD REASON TO GET IT. THEN THERE’S THE OTHER SIDE OF MY BRAIN THAT GOES, “YOU KNOW WHAT? F CK EVERYBODY ELSE. WHAT DO I REALLY WANT TO SEE? WHAT DO I REALLY WANT TO HAVE? WHAT DO I REALLY WANT TO BE? WHAT REALLY EXCITES ME?” THEY CAN BE VERY SEPARATE THINGS, IT’S A WEIRD THING. IT’S NOT EASY TO FOCUS ON YOUR SELFISH ID. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE, BUT IT’S NOT. IT’S ALMOST LIKE A REALLY SELFISH PSYCHOLOGICAL ZONE YOU HAVE TO CONJURE UP. IS THERE A PART OF YOU THAT THINKS, “I’VE GOT TO THINK OF WHAT’S GOING TO SELL. I HAVE EMPLOYEES, I HAVE TO PAY BILLS, I HAVE TO PAY FACTORIES.” DOES THAT FACTOR IN OR DO YOU TRY TO FREE YOURSELF OF THAT SORT OF THINKING? THAT’S THE LOGICAL SIDE. IT’S NOT LIKE THIS IS AN ASSIGNMENT WHERE I COMPROMISE BECAUSE FOR EVERY CATEGORY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR ME TO FILL, I FILL IT WITH THINGS THAT I’M PROUD OF. LIKE EVEN THE SIMPLEST PRE-COLLECTION T-SHIRT, IT’S MADE FROM A JERSEY I LIKE AND IT’S SOMETHING I WOULD WEAR. A T-SHIRT HAS JUST AS MUCH AS DESIRABILITY AND STATUS TO ME AS SOME OF THE MORE EXTRAVAGANT THINGS - ALMOST MORE BECAUSE I LOVE THE IDEA OF THINGS THAT I MAKE AND THAT COME FROM ME AND THAT GO THROUGH MY FILTER BEING THINGS THAT PEOPLE WEAR EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NOT JUST ON SOME SPECIAL OCCASION. WHAT DO YOU THINK ATTRACTS PEOPLE TO YOUR WORK? OR HAVE YOUR CUSTOMERS EVER TOLD YOU WHAT IT IS ABOUT YOUR DESIGNS THAT THEY LOVE? THERE IS EARNESTNESS TO WHAT I DO. IT CAN BE CORNY, THAT I WOULD PROBABLY MAKE FUN OF, BUT IT’S ABOUT GENUINELY CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN A CERTAIN KIND OF RIGOROUS PURSUIT OF A CERTAIN AESTHETIC. IT’S A VERY SPECIFIC AESTHETIC THAT I’VE BEEN VERY LOYAL TO AND I THINK PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED TO THAT. THEY RESPECT SOMEBODY WHO HAS A VERY STRONG OPINION ON SOMETHING. AND THIS OPINION IS INCLUSIVE AND TOLERANT AND AFFECTIONATE AND HAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF DRAMA - AND EVERYBODY LOVES A LITTLE DRAMA. ALSO, I THINK PEOPLE REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS REALLY MAKING AN EFFORT TO SPEAK TO ME. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO GENUINELY BELIEVES IN WHAT THEY’RE SAYING. I FEEL THAT MUST COME THROUGH SOMEWHERE. IS IT HARD TO MAINTAIN THAT REALLY HONEST ENERGY? NO, IT ISN’T. IT GETS EASIER AS I GO ALONG BECAUSE I HAVE LESS FEAR AS I GET OLDER. EVERYBODY DOES. I HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HISTORY NOW, I’VE BECOME MORE CONFIDENT THAT I’M NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR. MAYBE 15 YEARS AGO, I WOULDN’T HAVE HAD THAT CONFIDENCE. NOW I FEEL IT. IT WOULD BE HARD TO GET RID OF ME. I FEEL THAT MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DO SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS TRUE AND THE REST SHOULD FALL INTO PLACE. YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR DAILY AFTER-LUNCH NAP AND GOING TO THE GYM. DO YOU FIND THAT THOSE RITUALS HELP GROUND YOU AND CREATE A SPACE FOR YOU TO BE CREATIVE? MAYBE OR MAYBE THEY HOLD ME BACK BECAUSE I CLING TO THEM SO NEUROTICALLY, I’M NOT SURE. ALSO, YOU LIVE IN PARIS BUT DON’T SPEAK FRENCH VERY WELL. DOES THAT HELP YOU CREATE A WORLD WHERE YOU CAN FOCUS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON? IT REALLY DOES. IT’S ANOTHER LAYER OF PRIVACY. IT ALSO HELPS MAINTAIN THIS DELICIOUS SENSE OF ALIEN-NESS. I’M ALWAYS AN ALIEN HERE, WHICH IS NICE. YOU WORK OUT A LOT, YOU’RE INCREDIBLY FIT, AND YOUR WORK IS ABOUT SHAPING THE BODY IN SOME WAY. DO YOU SEE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOING TO THE GYM AND DESIGNING CLOTHING? I THINK A LOT OF IT IS ABOUT CONTROL AND SCULPTURE. I THINK IN A VERY SCULPTURAL, 3-D WAY. FOR MY BODY, THAT’S A FANTASTIC SENSE OF CONTROL, BECAUSE IT’S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS YOU ACTUALLY CAN CONTROL. IF YOU REALLY APPLY YOURSELF, YOU CAN REALLY MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN, YOU CAN ENACT CHANGE. YOU MIGHT NEVER GET RICH OR GET SUCCESS. EVEN WITH RELATIONSHIPS, YOU CAN’T CONTROL THEM. YOU HAVE TO LET OTHER PEOPLE BE WHO THEY NEED TO BE, BUT WITH YOUR BODY YOU CAN BE A COMPLETE FASCIST. IT’S BETTER THAN GARDENING. IN GARDENING YOU HAVE TO KIND OF DEAL WITH OTHER FACTORS LIKE WEATHER AND NATURE, BUT WITH YOUR BODY - IT’S PATHETIC REALLY - BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY CAN CONTROL. THERE’S SOMETHING VERY SATISFYING ABOUT THAT. I DON’T KNOW IF I’M EXTENDING THE CONTROL FROM MY BODY INTO CLOTHES, OR IF I’M EXTENDING THE CONTROL OF THE CLOTHES TO MY BODY, BUT IT IS A VERY SYMBIOTIC THING. DO YOU GET IDEAS AT THE GYM? I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS RIGHT AFTER I GET UP FROM MY NAP. THE WHOLE NAP THING IS REALLY A TOOL. I CALL IT A TEMPORARY SUICIDE BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY AND RESPOND TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS EVERY DAY. IT’S NOT UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT IT’S NOT MY COMFORT AREA. SO THE IDEA THAT I KNOW THAT I CAN ESCAPE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND I COULD JUST COMPLETELY GO AWAY IS GREAT. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND BRAINPOWER. THIS JOB IS NOT ABOUT STAMINA FOR ME, IT’S ABOUT MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS. I ONLY HAVE LIKE MAYBE FOUR HOURS A DAY WHERE I’M REALLY FOCUSED AND REALLY AT THE TOP OF MY GAME. SO I PROTECT THOSE FOUR HOURS BY SEPARATING THEM WITH THAT NAP. I’M BEST IN THE MORNING AND I’M BEST RIGHT AFTER MY NAP OF WHERE I HAVE THAT PERFECT BALANCE OF BEING ALERT BUT NOT BEING OVER SATURATED. YOU’VE BEEN DESIGNING FOR A LONG TIME. ARE THERE THEMES YOU FIND YOURSELF COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN? THOSE THEMES ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT. THERE ARE AESTHETIC THEMES AND SPIRITUAL THEMES. SPIRITUALLY, THERE’S A FATALISTIC ATTITUDE THAT YOU DO YOUR BEST, ALTHOUGH IT’S DUE. EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO THAT BECAUSE IT’S A VERY PROFOUND CYCLE. IT’S A CYCLE THAT’S BEEN GLORIFIED IN OPERAS, TV SHOWS, IT’S THE CYCLE OF LIFE, IT’S ABOUT MORTALITY. AESTHETICALLY, THERE’S A GRAY BRUTALISM AND A BROODING DARKNESS THAT HAS ALWAYS APPEALED TO ME. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE’S A GIDDINESS, YOU CAN’T TAKE THAT DARKNESS TOO SERIOUSLY. THAT DARKNESS IS THERE, IT’S THERE FOR ALL OF US AND IT’S WONDERFUL TO INDULGE IN IT. BUT THERE’S THE CAMP SIDE OF ME THAT KNOWS THAT IT’S INDULGENT AND THERE’S THE CAMP SIDE OF ME THAT CAN’T HELP BUT MAKE FUN OF IT. WHAT’S THE BIGGEST CHANGE YOU’VE SEEN HAPPEN IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY SINCE YOU STARTED WORKING? IT’S BECOME OVERSATURATED. I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S A BAD THING. I EQUATE IT WITH THE SUNSET STRIP IN THE 1970S WHEN THERE WAS A VERY BIG ROCK MOMENT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, BANDS WERE BEING SIGNED EVERY TWENTY MINUTES AND ANYBODY COULD GO TO SUNSET STRIP AND TRY TO BE A ROCK STAR. 20 YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED, THERE WEREN’T THIS MANY DESIGNERS. I DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH IT’S MULTIPLIED BUT WE ALL KNOW IT HAS. ELITISM ISN’T A POPULAR WORD THESE DAYS, BUT THE INTERNET HAS DEMOCRATIZED EVERYTHING. I’M GOING TO SOUND LIKE A DOUCHE BUT EVERYBODY GETS TO BE RIGHT NOW. WE ARE TRYING TO SATISFY THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR NOW. I HOPE YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PUT THAT WITHOUT MAKING EVERYBODY HATE ME. STANDARDS HAVE LOWERED. THERE, I SAID IT. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REALLY RESPONDING POSITIVELY TO YOU, ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST FEW SEASONS. DO YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE CRITICS? THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I HAD A PRESS AGENT AND I HAD TO GET RID OF HIM BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT I DIDN’T LIKE HAVING THE CONVERSATION EVERYDAY OF WHAT MY STATUS WAS IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND HOW IT NEEDED TO IMPROVE. IT MADE ME CRAZY. IT MADE ME FEEL INSECURE AND ICKY, SO I THOUGHT “F CK THIS,” AND I MOVED ON. WHEN I FELT LIKE I WAS STABLE, LIKE I’M KIND OF ESTABLISHED, THEN I REALIZED I NEEDED A PRESS AGENT IN MY ORGANIZATION JUST TO DEAL WITH THE REQUESTS. I THINK THE THING THAT SETS ME APART NOW IS THAT I’VE STUCK TO MY THING AS THE WHOLE FASHION WORLD HAS BECOME SO TRANSIENT, WITH DESIGNERS BOUNCING AROUND OR GETTING FIRED SO BRUTALLY. THAT MAKES SOMEBODY LIKE ME, WHO’S STUCK TO MY LANE, STAND OUT MORE THAN EVER, IN CONTRAST TO DESIGNERS WHO POP UP AND DISAPPEAR OR WHO ARE BEING REPLACED. ALL THAT SIGNIFIES IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY AND SUPERFICIALITY, THE SUPERFICIALITY THAT EVERYONE ACCUSES FASHION OF - THAT ONLY EMPHASIZES IT. WE DON’T ALLOW PEOPLE TO DEVELOP THEIR VOICE. IF THEY DON’T PERFORM OR ASTOUND THE AUDIENCE IN THE FIRST YEAR, THEY’RE SACKED. THAT’S PRETTY BRUTAL. I DON’T LIKE THAT WORLD; THAT SEEMS LIKE AN UNSTABLE AND RUTHLESS PLACE. IT’S LIKE WATCHING GLADIATORS AT THE COLOSSEUM BATTLE EACH OTHER TO THEIR DEATH. THAT JUST MAKES SOMEONE LIKE ME STAND OUT ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON’T LIKE GLADIATORS HACKING EACH OTHER TO DEATH, I CAN BE A RELIEF. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEAUTIFUL, AND HOW DO YOU TRY TO EXPRESS THAT IN YOUR WORK? KINDNESS IS BEAUTIFUL. WIT IS BEAUTIFUL. NOT EVERYBODY IS BLESSED WITH CLASSICAL BEAUTY, I DON’T REJECT CLASSICAL BEAUTY. CLASSICAL BEAUTY IS WONDERFUL. AND I RESPOND TO IT TOO. I DON’T REJECT IT, BUT I’M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, NOT ALL OF US COULD GET THAT CLASSICAL BEAUTY SO WHAT ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS? WHAT OTHER THINGS CAN WE DEVELOP? SO THAT’S WHAT I TRY AND DO. I TRY AND EXPLORE THAT SIDE BECAUSE THERE’S RUTHLESSNESS TO BEAUTY TOO. THE WAY THE INTERNET WORKS NOW, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE PRESENTED WITH THESE IDEAS OF BEAUTY AND YOU GET THE FEELING THAT YOU’RE ENTITLED TO IT. WE’RE NOT, WE’RE NOT ENTITLED TO ANYTHING. WE’RE NOT ENTITLED TO HAPPINESS. WE’RE NOT ENTITLED TO BEAUTY, WE’RE NOT ENTITLED TO COMFORT. WE’RE LUCKY IF WE GET A FRACTION OF ANY OF THOSE THINGS. THAT’S THE CYNIC IN ME … AGAIN. SPEAKING OF THE INTERNET, ARE YOU A BIG INTERNET USER? I DON’T SEE A PERSONAL ACCOUNT ON INSTAGRAM. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, I AM. I’M NOT ON INSTAGRAM, I MEAN WE HAVE A BRAND ACCOUNT … OR WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? CHANNEL? I DON’T EVEN F CKING KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT! WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY? ACCOUNT? YEAH, ACCOUNT. THERE’S RICK OWENS ONLINE, WHICH I CONTROL VERY CLOSELY, BUT I’M DOING IT WRONG BECAUSE IT’S VERY CURATED AND CALCULATED. I HAVE A GUY WHO’S BEEN WITH ME WHO TAKES CARE OF ALL THE VISUALS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHY. HE COLLECTS IMAGERY OF OURS, MAKES A CURATION AND PRESENTS LIKE TWO WEEKS WORTH OF IMAGERY. I PICK THROUGH IT AND CHANGE SOME STUFF. IT’S STIFF AND CALCULATED, BUT IT’S ALSO VERY PERSONAL. THAT’S LIKE THE WHOLE STORY OF MY COMPANY. IT’S VERY STYLIZED AND VERY CALCULATED, BUT I’M THERE BEHIND EVERY SINGLE THING. IT’S NOT SPONTANEOUS, BUT I’M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT SPONTANEITY IS A LITTLE OVERRATED. I LIKE THINGS A LITTLE MORE FORMAL, MORE THOUGHT OUT. I LIKE THINGS TO BE PRECISE. YOU KNOW, MICHELE [LAMY, RICK’S WIFE AND MUSE] IS ON INSTAGRAM. SO SHE’S CHECKING HER INSTAGRAM AND WE’RE IN THE CAR GOING SOMEWHERE AND I LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER AND WE’RE GIGGLING, AND I SEE MICHELE HAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT LIFE THAT I DON’T KNOW ABOUT! SHE’S SCROLLING THROUGH INSTAGRAM AND I’M LIKE, “OH MY GOD, YOU’RE STILL, YOU’RE STILL IN TOUCH WITH JOANNE FROM 20 YEARS AGO?” SHE’S HAVING THIS WORLD EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE THAT I HAD NO IDEA. MY FRAME OF CONTEXT IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. I FEEL LIKE MICHELE DOES IT FOR ME, IN A WAY. I CALL HER MY TRANSLATOR. SHE CIRCULATES MORE THAN I DO, SHE HAS MORE WARMTH, SHE’S MORE GREGARIOUS THAN I AM. SHE’LL COME HOME AND TELL ME WHO WAS AT THE PARTY, THAT WAY I GET THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PARTY WITHOUT HAVING TO ACTUALLY BE THERE. DOES SHE BRING THE OUTSIDE WORLD TO YOU SO YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO YOUR WORK? I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY DOES. I’M CONSTANTLY EDITING EVERYTHING AROUND ME. I GET IDEAS ON THE METRO, WHEN I WALK THROUGH THE TUILERIES ON THE WAY TO THE GYM. I CHECK EVERY SINGLE THING OUT AND THEN THINK OF HOW I CAN APPLY IT TO WHAT I DO. SHE DEFINITELY HAS A SMILE AND ATTITUDE ABOUT LIFE THAT CORRESPONDS WITH MINE. BUT SHE DOES SURPRISE ME. SHE’LL BRING HOME SOME WEIRD-ASS SCULPTURE THAT I HATE AND THEN TWO YEARS LATER, I LOVE IT. SHE STIMULATES ME, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT A LOT OF THINGS STIMULATE ME. I’M ALWAYS LOOKING TO BE STIMULATED. HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN STUCK? I’M ALWAYS STORING THOUGHTS AND IDEAS. I’M WRITING NOTES TO MYSELF CONSTANTLY, WEIRD LITTLE NOTES LIKE ‘PSYCHOTROPIC EXPLODER INEVITABLE’ AND THAT’S A CODE FOR THINGS THAT I KNOW ABOUT THAT I THINK CAN COORDINATE TOGETHER. I FEEL THAT EVERYTHING’S ALREADY THERE, I JUST HAVE TO UNTANGLE IT EVERY SEASON. BUT EVERYTHING I EVER DO IS ALREADY THERE, INSIDE ME. IT’S JUST A MATTER OF ORGANIZING IT AND MAKING A NEW COMPOSITION FROM IT. I LOOK AT CERTAIN TOUCHSTONES TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER. I LOOK AT DONALD JUDD, JOSEPH BEUYS, MICHAEL HEIZER. THERE WAS A CONSISTENT, STRONG MESSAGE IN WHAT THEY DID AND HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO TWEAK IT AND MAINTAIN IT. IT HELPS ME REMEMBER THAT I’VE GOT THIS, I KNOW WHAT I’M DOING AND I’VE GOT A BODY OF WORK AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT AND THAT TELLS ME WHERE TO GO NEXT. DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR WORK POLITICAL? YEAH, I DO. I DON’T MEAN THAT I’M CHANGING THE WORLD. I MEAN THAT THERE’S A REAL MORAL ENERGY BEHIND IT ON MY BEHALF. THERE IS A NEED TO CONTRIBUTE. I DO REALLY BELIEVE THAT WHAT I’M DOING IS A POSITIVE MESSAGE, WHICH IS WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS. ANYBODY’S POSITIVE MESSAGE HELPS. MINE IS TINY, BUT EVEN THE MOST MINUSCULE POSITIVE MESSAGE IS THE RIGHT THING. HOW DO YOU FEEL AS AN AMERICAN LIVING ABROAD AND SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE US? DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR WORK AT ALL? I THINK THE WORLD HAS SEEN THIS BEFORE, IT’S SEEN MISBEHAVIOR, BAD JUDGMENT AND SLUMPS. AND IT HAS RECOVERED. IT’S JUST AN UNFORTUNATE CYCLE. IT IS A LITTLE DISCOURAGING TO SEE THINGS REVERT, TO REVERSE LIKE THAT. BUT FOR A CYNIC LIKE ME, I THINK, “WELL THAT’S THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS.” WE CAN BE AS LOFTY AS WE WANT, BUT OUR SHIT STILL STINKS. THERE ARE SOME CRUDE ELEMENTS OF LIFE THAT ARE JUST NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY AND THERE MUST BE SOME REASON FOR THEM. THERE MUST BE. THERE MUST BE SOME REASON FOR EVIL. I HAVEN’T FIGURED IT OUT, BUT IT’S NOT GOING AWAY SO THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF BALANCE. MY ROLE IS TO TRY AND HELP MAINTAIN THAT BALANCE. DO YOU THINK YOU’RE SUCCESSFUL AT THAT? WELL, I DON’T KNOW, I HAVEN’T CHANGED ANYTHING. I’M SENDING OUT MESSAGES OF HUMOR, OF NOT TAKING YOURSELF TOO SERIOUSLY, THE MESSAGE THAT SEX IS FUN, OF MAKING FUN OF FALSE MORALITY AND FALSE MORAL QUEASINESS. SO I’M HELPING. I DON’T KNOW IF I’M MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT I FEEL LIKE I’M DOING THE RIGHT THING. LOS ANGELES HAS BECOME AN EXCITING PLACE, AND THAT’S WHERE YOU STARTED. WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR TIME THERE? I HAVEN’T BEEN THERE SINCE I MOVED TO EUROPE, SO I DON’T KNOW. I’VE HEARD IT HAS REALLY TRANSFORMED BUT I HAVEN’T BEEN THERE IN LIKE 20 YEARS. I DON’T KNOW WHY, BUT I DON’T REALLY WANT TO GO. I HAVE SO MANY OTHER PLACES I’D LIKE TO GO AND I DON’T LIKE GOING PLACES WHERE I DON’T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO. I’M NOT VERY GOOD AT VACATIONS. I DON’T LIKE STAYING IN HOTELS, I USED TO LOVE IT BUT NOT ANYMORE. I DON’T LIKE HAVING UNRESOLVED INTERIORS. I DON’T LIKE LIVING WITH OTHER PEOPLE’S COMPRISES. I HAVE A VERY SMALL LIFE NOW. I LIVE IN MY HOUSE, MY APARTMENT NEXT TO THE FACTORY OR MY APARTMENT IN VENICE. THOSE PLACES ARE SO SPECIFICALLY MY AESTHETIC AND IT WOULD IRRITATE ME TO BE IN A SUITE THAT HAD THE WRONG WASTE PAPER BASKET. THAT’S JUST ME TURNING INTO A CRANKY OLD MAN. SO I’D GO TO LA IF I HAD A DECORATED HOUSE TO STAY AT. THE OTHER THING ABOUT LA IS THAT I WAS NOT THE PERSON I WANTED TO BE THERE, I FELT SO UNFORMED. I WAS STRUGGLING, I WAS A MESSY ALCOHOLIC, I WAS INSECURE. I’M NOT IN A HURRY TO GO BACK THERE. BUT YOU STARTED YOUR CAREER THERE, YOU MET MICHELE THERE. THAT’S WHAT MICHELE SAYS, SHE SAYS, WE HAD A GREAT TIME. AND I TELL HER, WELL I BROUGHT YOU WITH ME. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT YOU THAT PEOPLE DON’T UNDERSTAND? NOT REALLY. I’M PRETTY SIMPLE. I’M NOT THAT COMPLICATED. NOT EVERYBODY LIKES ME AND I TOTALLY GET THAT. I’M KINDA OF A LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT PROPOSITION. I CAN SEE WHY I’M NOT EVERYONE’S CUP OF TEA, BUT I DON’T FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD AND IF I AM, IT’S MY OWN FAULT. SOME PEOPLE ASK ME IF I MIGHT BE CALLED A GOTH, AND IT’S NOT MY FAVORITE WORD, BUT I GET IT. COMPARED TO STELLA MCCARTNEY, SURE, I GET IT. IT’S A BUSY WORLD AND PEOPLE NEED TO SIMPLIFY AND SUMMARIZE, AND I SUMMARIZE ALL THE TIME. I CLOCK SOMEONE AND JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER ALL THE TIME. BUT IF IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS THAT I WOULDN’T HAVE LASTED THIS LONG, AND I THINK PEOPLE KNOW THAT. I DON’T REALLY SWEAT IT.

SMITH RICK OWENS HAS CARVED OUT AN ALTERNATIVE LANE IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. IN 17 YEARS OF MAKING BOUNDARY-PUSHING MEN’S CLOTHING, HE HAS SENT MALE MODELS DOWN THE RUNWAY IN SKIRTS, PLATFORM BOOTS AND PEEKABOO-SLASHED TOPS AND BOTTOMS. MR. OWENS HAS MANAGED TO MAKE SUCH TRANSGRESSIVE ITEMS LOOK TOUGH, BALANCING THEM WITH LEATHER JACKETS, DROP-CROTCH AND WIDE-LEGGED TROUSERS, LONG BAGGY SHORTS, FLOOR-SWEEPING COATS, THIGH-SKIMMING T-SHIRTS, AND HIGH-TOP SNEAKERS—MOSTLY IN BLACK, GREY AND OTHER NEUTRAL SHADES. HIS BUSINESS, WHICH HAS ANNUAL SALES AROUND $140 MILLION, INCLUDES HIGH-END AND MORE-AFFORDABLE WOMENSWEAR LINES, A DENIM-BASED LINE AND A LINE OF FURS. HE CALLS THE GOTH, GLAMOUR-MEETS-GRUNGE AESTHETIC “GLUNGE.” HIS MALE AUDIENCE INCLUDES ROCK FANS, RAP FOLLOWERS, GAY NIGHTLIFE DENIZENS, HIGH-FASHION OBSESSIVES AND TWITTER CEO JACK DORSEY. BASED IN PARIS, MR. OWENS GREW UP IN PORTERVILLE, CALIF., AND STARTED HIS LABEL IN LOS ANGELES WITH A WOMEN’S LINE IN 1994. SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA NOMINATED HIM FOR MENSWEAR DESIGNER OF THE YEAR. AT THE CFDA AWARDS CEREMONY JUNE 3 IN BROOKLYN, N.Y., THE 56-YEAR-OLD DESIGNER WILL FACE OFF AGAINST TWO, YOUNGER STREETWEAR-INFLUENCED RIVALS, MIKE AMIRI OF AMIRI, AND VIRGIL ABLOH OF OFF-WHITE, AS WELL AS KERBY JEAN-RAYMOND OF THE HIGH-CONCEPT LABEL PYER MOSS AND THOM BROWNE, WHO HAS BEEN NOMINATED EVERY YEAR SINCE 2013 AND WON IN 2013 AND 2016. MR. OWENS’S FASHIONS FLOUT CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY STANDARDS, CHALLENGE GENDER NORMS AND EMBRACE SUBCULTURES. HIS AUDACIOUS PRESENTATIONS, TYPICALLY HELD ON THE GROUNDS OF THE ART-FILLED PALAIS DE TOKYO IN PARIS, HAVE INSPIRED YOUNGER DESIGNERS TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE CATWALK. MODELS IN ONE SHOW CIRCLED A TOWERING STRUCTURE ENGULFED IN FLAMES; IN ANOTHER, THEY CARRIED EACH OTHER. AT ONE SHOW, BLACK-COLLEGE SORORITY STEP-DANCERS APPEARED IN LIEU OF MODELS. HIS MOST RECENT MEN’S AND WOMEN’S COLLECTIONS WERE INFLUENCED BY ’70S DESIGNER LARRY LEGASPI, WHO MADE OTHERWORLDLY COSTUMES FOR KISS, LABELLE AND OTHER GROUPS. MR. OWENS WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE LATE DESIGNER, WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER. IT IS HIS FOURTH BOOK; HE ALSO DESIGNS FURNITURE. MR. OWENS—IN A GO-TO ENSEMBLE OF WHITE TANK TOP, BLACK SHORTS AND BLACK RUNNING SNEAKERS WITH “BLACK SOCKS UP TO MY KNEES”—SPOKE WITH THE JOURNAL ABOUT THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND INFLUENCERS. EDITED EXCERPTS FOLLOW. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT STREETWEAR AND ITS DOMINANCE OF MEN’S FASHION IN RECENT YEARS? IT’S NOT STUFF I’M GOING TO WEAR. AND I DO LOOK AT IT SOMETIMES WITH A LITTLE BIT OF AN EYE ROLL. BUT SOME OF IT IS REALLY GREAT. SOME OF IT IS SMART AND WITTY. I THINK THERE IS A WIT TO FASHION NOW THAT IS FRESH. IS THE FASHION INDUSTRY IN CRISIS? “CRISIS” IS QUITE DRAMATIC. THE FASHION INDUSTRY HAS ALWAYS HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF DRAMA QUEENS. I DON’T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL IT A CRISIS. IT’S JUST EVOLUTION. I SEE IT AS A TRANSITION. HOW CAN INDEPENDENT BRANDS LIKE YOURS SURVIVE? I THINK THERE’S ENOUGH PEOPLE THAT CAN RESPOND TO WHAT WE DO AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESPECT THAT WE CAN’T BEND OVER TO SATISFY EVERY SINGLE REQUEST. I DON’T KNOW. I’M STILL FIGURING THIS OUT MYSELF. MAYBE I’M A DINOSAUR THAT CAN BE EXTINCT NEXT YEAR. YOUR BRAND IS ON INSTAGRAM BUT YOU DON’T USE INFLUENCERS OR POST PICTURES OF CELEBRITIES WEARING YOUR DESIGNS. WHY NOT? THIS AESTHETIC OF USING INFLUENCERS IS A VERY VALID, INTERESTING EXERCISE. IT’S ONE THAT I AM NOT ADEPT AT. I’M CONSCIOUS OF IT. I RESPECT IT AND I ADMIRE IT. IT’S KIND OF HORRIBLE AND IT’S KIND OF GREAT. EVERY CONSUMER IS NOW AWARE OF THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES MECHANISM AND MEANS TO ENTICE THEM. EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT AN INFLUENCER IS. THERE’S SOMETHING INSINCERE ABOUT THAT WORD. THERE’S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INSINCERITY THAT EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES. I LIKE THE BEAUTY AND HORROR OF IT. YOU HAVE FANS IN THEIR 40S AND 50S, AS WELL AS YOUNG STREETWEAR ENTHUSIASTS, SKATEBOARDERS AND SNEAKERHEADS. WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT TO? MAYBE I AUTHENTICALLY AM INTERESTED IN THAT WORLD. THEIR INTEREST IN ME MIGHT BE THEY SENSE AN AUTHENTIC INTEREST IN THEM AND THAT I’M NOT USING THEM. I’M NOT KIND OF SUCKING UP TO THEM. AND I AM A CREATOR IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO BE CREATORS. THEY WANT TO BE AUTHENTIC AND EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN A DIFFERENT WAY. YOU’VE BEEN A PIONEER ON INCLUSION AND BROADER BEAUTY STANDARDS. IS THE INDUSTRY GETTING BETTER ON THIS? IT WAS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY WORK TO SUGGEST THAT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER OPTIONS. I’M SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AND NOT ALL OF US HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSICAL BEAUTY. BECAUSE THE RULES OF CLASSICAL BEAUTY CAN BE A LITTLE BIT CRUEL AND A LITTLE BIT NARROW. LET’S BE FLEXIBLE ABOUT HOW WE CONSIDER OTHER PEOPLE’S APPEARANCES. THAT STARTS LEADING INTO RACE AND ACCEPTANCE. I THINK IT’S A GREAT MESSAGE. WE CAN AFFORD TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE. THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS LISTENING TO IT. THE FASHION INDUSTRY HAS ONLY EVER RESPONDED TO WHAT PEOPLE WANTED. I’M HAPPY THAT THINGS SEEM TO BE EVOLVING. ARE FASHION SHOWS STILL EFFECTIVE? THERE ARE TOO MANY FASHION SHOWS TODAY, FOR SURE. BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GATHERING TOGETHER TO WORSHIP FASHION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND THAT’S NOT GOING TO STOP. THEY’RE GOING TO FIND ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO DO IT.

HE&#39;S DOWN THE LINE FROM THE PENTHOUSE APARTMENT ON VENICE&#39;S LIDO TO WHICH, IN MOMENTS OF RELATIVE RESPITE FROM THE RHYTHMS OF HIS PARIS-BASED FASHION HOUSE, HE RETREATS. OWENS&#39;S ODYSSEY FROM THAT THEN TO THIS NOW HAS SHAPED ARGUABLY THE MOST ORIGINAL DESIGNER AT WORK IN FASHION TODAY. YET HE IS MORE THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS OF THAT JOURNEY METAPHOR: THE RAW MATERIAL OF RICK IS ITSELF, EXTREMELY DISTINCT. VIA MEANDERING CONVERSATION, WE DO THE ARITHMETIC: TALKING THROUGH THE FACTORS OF AN EQUATION WHOSE RESULT IS A DESIGNER WHOSE FAN BASE, APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORILY, IS AS BROAD AS IT IS PARTICULAR. FOLLOWERS OF RICK SPAN A BROAD CHURCH OF AESTHETIC DEMOGRAPHICS THAT RUN FROM HYPEBEAST TO TECH-GOTH VIA ARTISTIC-ASCETIC AND BEYOND. HE HAPPILY CONCURS – “IT’S GREAT, ISN’T IT?” – BEFORE ADDING THAT HIS OWN THEORY AS TO WHY IS BASED LESS ON WHAT HE IS THAN WHAT HE ISN’T. HE SAYS: “THERE’S AN AUTHENTICITY WHICH IS RARE IN THE WORLD NOW. AND WHEN EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO SO MUCH INFORMATION FROM EVERY FASHION HOUSE, EVERY SINGLE CONSUMER KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT LENGTHS ARE BEING TAKEN TO SEDUCE THEM. AUDIENCES HAVE SEEN BEHIND THAT CURTAIN. AND WHAT THEY SEE BEHIND THE CURTAIN IS THAT THERE’S A LOT OF CALCULATION IN FASHION. THERE ARE LOTS OF VOICES, LOTS OF COMMITTEE DECISIONS. THERE’S CORRUPTION, THERE’S BRIBERY, THERE ARE CELEBRITIES BEING PAID TO ENDORSE OBJECTS. AND THERE’S PHOTOSHOP, AND THERE’S SURGERY… THERE’S A LOT OF FALSENESS.” SO THEY SEE IT’S A RACKET? &quot;YEAH! AND SO WHEN THEY SEE THAT SOMEBODY IS DOING THEIR BEST TO TELL THE TRUTH – TO TELL THEIR TRUTH – AS A SINGLE VOICE AS OPPOSED TO VIA COMMITTEE, THEN I THINK THERE&#39;S SOMETHING VERY COMPELLING IN THAT. BECAUSE WE’RE NOT INTERESTED IN A GROUP OF ARTISTS; WE&#39;RE INTERESTED IN A SINGLE VOICE THAT IS PURE. ALTHOUGH I’M NOT CALLING MYSELF AN ARTIST.&quot; HA! FOR A SECOND THERE I&#39;D ASSUMED THAT WHAT OWENS WAS GOING TO TAKE PAINS NOT TO CALL HIMSELF WAS “PURE”. BECAUSE THE CONVENTIONALLY IMPURE – AN OTHERNESS VARIOUSLY ARTICULATED VIA DECADENCE, OR SEX, OR GLAMOUR, OR GRIME – HAS ALWAYS BEEN A KEY INSTRUMENT IN THE OWENS ORCHESTRA. TAKE HIS MOST RECENT COLLECTION, AUTUMN/WINTER 2019-20, IN WHICH THAT IMPURITY WAS ARTICULATED VIA A HOMAGE TO THE WORK OF LARRY LEGASPI. THIS HITHERTO NEGLECTED-BY-HISTORY AMERICAN DESIGNER SPEARHEADED THE SEXED-UP, SCI-FI, SLEAZY SUBVERSIVENESS OF ‘70S POP MUSIC COSTUME THROUGH HIS WORK OUTFITTING LABELLE AND KISS. AS WELL AS THE LOVING LEGASPI REFERENCES IN HIS COLLECTION — TOWERING “LARRY” PLATFORMS AND LIGHTNING-BOLT HARDWARE – OWENS ALSO, NO SLIGHT ASIDE, WROTE A BOOK TITLED LEGASPI BY RICK OWENS. YET OWENS’S SUBJECT WAS NOT ONLY THE DESIGNER WHO SO INFLUENCED HIM. “THE BOOK W AS APPROVED BY LARRY’S WIDOW, BUT WHEN I SPOKE TO HER I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS ALSO VERY MUCH A BOOK ABOUT ME. IT WAS ABOUT WHAT THE WORK OF LARRY MEANT TO ME WHEN I WAS 13 – GLAMOUR, KABUKI, TESTOSTERONE. MY PERSPECTIVE ON LARRY WAS THAT I WAS SEEING THE BLACK-AND-WHITE EPIC MOVIES OF HOLLYWOOD MIXED WITH A SWEATY, SLEAZY, BACKSTAGE ENERGY OF ROCK CLUBS – ALL OF THAT TINSEL AND SPANGLE – THAT BECOMES GLAMOUR ON STAGE. AND THAT’S WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED AND CREATED FOR MYSELF.” HERE THEN IS A HANDY STARTING POINT FOR CATALOGUING SOME PRIME INGREDIENTS IN OWENS’S ORIGINAL RECIPE. BACK IN PORTERVILLE, OWENS WAS A SINGLE CHILD RAISED BY MOTHER CONNIE (A TEACHER) AND FATHER JOHN (A SOCIAL WORKER) WHO REFUSED TO HAVE A TV IN THE HOUSE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT RICK RAIDED HIS DAD’S LIBRARY OF MUSIC (MOSTLY CLASSICAL) AND BOOKS (A FAIR FEW OF WHICH WERE DEDICATED TO EPIC PRE-COLOUR HOLLYWOOD MOVIES). “THOSE BIBLICAL EPICS… THEY REALLY DWELT ON THE SINNING. THEY RELISH IT. THERE ARE THOSE GREAT, LONG, LURID SCENES, CHRISTIANS WAITING TO BE EATEN BY LIONS, PEOPLE BEING RIPPED APART, VIRGINS BEING ATTACKED BY ALLIGATORS… ALL THROUGH THE 1930S BLACK-AND-WHITE FILTER WITH THE GIRLS IN WHITE BIAS CUT GOWNS. THEN, AFTER ALL THE DWELLING ON SIN, THERE IS SUDDENLY A MORAL RESOLUTION. A SENSE THAT THE WHOLE THING HAS A HIGHER PURPOSE. AND I THINK THAT MIX OF THE LURID, THE GLAMOUR, THE BLACK AND WHITE, AND THE MORALITY FLOATING OVER THE WHOLE THING WAS A SUPER HUGE INFLUENCE. THAT IS KIND OF WHAT I DO: THE BLACK AND WHITE THING.” WHILE YOUNG OWENS WAS CULTIVATING THE LUBRICIOUS INSINUATIONS OF SWORD AND SANDAL EPICS, HE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY ENGAGED IN ANOTHER REAL-LIFE TUSSLE BETWEEN INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE. “I WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL WITH NUNS IN HABITS AND LONG ROBES, WHICH WAS PRETTY GLAMOROUS IN PORTERVILLE. AND EVERY MORNING WE WENT TO MASS AND WE WERE ALL LOOKING AT THIS HOT NAKED GUY HANGING FROM THE CROSS. SO THERE WAS A LOT TO STIMULATE!” AS A TEENAGER, SAYS OWENS, “I THINK I WAS REALLY EASY TO RAISE – UNTIL I WASN’T, WHEN I REALLY, REALLY WASN’T!” HIS PARENTS’ CULTURAL CLOISTERING – SO FRUITFUL IN THE LONG RUN – FELT SO SUFFOCATING THEN. “I WAS VERY RESENTFUL WHEN I WAS YOUNG. I WAS DESPERATE TO GO AND HANG AT MY FRIEND’S HOUSE AND WATCH THE MUNSTERS.” ONCE OF AGE, CIRCA 1979, OWENS DECAMPED TO LOS ANGELES IN ORDER TO STUDY ART AND LEARN THAT HE DIDN’T WANT TO PURSUE A CAREER IN IT. HE PIVOTED TO PATTERN CUTTING, AND IRONICALLY ENOUGH SOME OF THIS AS-YET-UNFLEDGED FASHION ORIGINAL’S FIRST PAID JOBS WERE RUNNING UP BACK STREET COPIES OF OTHER PEOPLE’S FASHION DESIGNS. THIS PERIOD ALSO REPRESENTED HIS ENTRÉE INTO A TATTERED AND GRIMY BUT STIMULATING EXCITING DEMIMONDE. “IT WAS STILL VERY MUCH ABOUT MY HOLLYWOOD NOSTALGIA. I WAS LIVING ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, BUT IT HAD SEEN ITS HEYDAY LONG BEFORE. WHEN I ARRIVED THERE WAS STILL GLAMOUR, BUT IT WAS DECOMPOSED, FALLING APART AND CORRUPTED. WHICH OF COURSE IS WHY I WAS THERE. I WANTED TO BE CORRUPTED. AND I WAS!” THESE WERE OWENS’ HARD-PARTYING YEARS. AFTER AROUND A DECADE OF THIS SCENE, HE BECAME CLEAN AND SERENE FOLLOWING A MOMENT OF CLARITY IN THE MIDST OF THE MISTS OF A LACK OF IT. THE TRANSITION WAS PARTIALLY ACTIONED VIA MICHÈLE LAMY, WHOM HE HAD MET DURING A WORK GIG IN 1988 AND WITH WHOM HE BEGAN A LOVE STORY THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. ALSO CONTINUING TO THIS DAY IS A HEALTHY FASCINATION WITH THE UNHEALTHY BUT INVIGORATING NATURE OF REVELRY. WITH GREAT DELIGHT, OWENS REPORTS THAT HE RECENTLY ATTENDED A NIGHT AT PARIS’S PÉRIPATE VENUE THAT KINDLED AFRESH HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR DEBAUCHERY: “THE PÉRIPATE IS THIS BIG CONCRETE BUNKER WHICH HAS ALMOST PALLADIAN PROPORTIONS BUT ON A SUPERHUMAN SCALE. AND THE MUSIC WAS JUST THIS SUPER-SWEATY TECHNO. THE CROWD IS VERY MIXED: THERE ARE STRAIGHT COUPLES, GAY COUPLES, AND THE DANCE FLOOR IS LIT AT THE FRONT WHERE THE DJ IS. THEN IT’S KIND OF DARK AROUND THE EDGES, AND EVERYBODY IS F CKING. WHICH IS WHAT A CLUB SHOULD BE.” OWENS ADDS, HOWEVER, THAT THE ONLY BAR HE HITS THESE DAYS IS THE SALAD BAR. “I HAVE GREAT AFFECTION FOR THAT STUFF – IN A NOSTALGIC, PATERNAL WAY – AND I LOVE ENGAGING WITH IT, BUT I’M JUST NOT GOOD AT IT ANYMORE. YOU GET OLDER AND YOUR BODY CAN’T CONSUME WHAT IT USED TO… BUT I LOVE SEEING IT. IT’S THRILLING TO SEE BEAUTY AND DANGER HAND IN HAND.” THE THRILL THAT LURKS IN DARKNESS AT THE EDGE OF LIGHT IS NOT A BAD DEFINITION OF OWENS’S RAW PRODUCT. HE USED TO CALL HIS AESTHETIC “GLUNGE”, A MIX OF GLAMOUR AND GRUNGE, AND IT WAS ONE HE STARTED DEFINING IN FABRIC UNDER HIS OWN NAME IN 1994. WITHIN A FEW YEARS HE HAD FOUND A PROTEAN AUDIENCE OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING COURTNEY LOVE, WHO WERE DRAWN TO HIS SUMPTUOUSLY CUT BUT POWERFULLY BATTERED LEATHER JACKETS AND T-SHIRTS IN ORIGINALLY LUXURIOUS FABRICS TREATED TO SEEM AS DECOMPOSED AS HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. BY 2001, DEMAND OUTSTRIPPED OWENS’S CAPACITY TO MEET IT FROM HIS STUDIO, AND HE WENT INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ELSA LANZO AND LUCA RUGGERI – WHO TODAY ARE RESPECTIVELY THE CEO AND COMMERCIAL MANAGER OF THE LABEL’S HOLDING COMPANY, OWENSCORP. “THEY HAVE BEEN WITH ME SINCE THE VERY FIRST NEW YORK SHOW,” SAYS OWENS. “IT’S LIKE A MIRACLE. TO BE WITH PARTNERS THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE AS CREATIVE AS YOU WANT AND WHO DON’T BLINK AT ANYTHING – THEY JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN. THAT IS THE MIRACLE. IT’S VERY UNUSUAL IN THIS BUSINESS TO HAVE A LONG MARRIAGE LIKE THAT, SO I’VE BEEN VERY LUCKY WITH BOTH MY MARRIAGES.” THE FIRST NEW YORK SHOW, IN 2002, WAS THE RESULT OF OWENS’S SUDDEN PROPULSION DOWN ONE OF THE FASHION LANDSCAPE’S MOST TUMULTUOUS BUT POTENTIALLY FRUITFUL RAPIDS: HEARTY SUPPORT FROM AMERICAN VOGUE. FIRST SALLY SINGER AND THEN ANNA WINTOUR CHAMPIONED OWENS IN THE TITLE, WHICH THEN SPONSORED THAT FIRST SHOW. IN SHORT ORDER THIS LED TO A CFDA PERRY ELLIS AWARD, HIS HIRING BY A FRENCH FUR HOUSE, AND A MOVE IN 2003 WITH LAMY TO PARIS TO DO THAT JOB AND BUILD HIS OWN LINE. THOSE RAPIDS PROVIDED A POWERFUL ACCELERATION. BUT AS OWENS RECALLS IT, HE WAS IN TWO MINDS ABOUT GETTING ON BOARD IN THE FIRST PLACE. “I WAS TEMPTED NOT TO DO IT BECAUSE I WAS THINKING THEN THAT MY AESTHETIC WAS PRETTY NARROW, VERY GREY, AND BLACK AND WHITE – JUST ME AND MY VISION. AND HOW LONG WOULD THAT REALLY LAST IN THIS FASTER WORLD? I THOUGHT I COULD STAY QUIETLY DESIGNING, SELLING TO A FEW STORES AND DOING MY THING. OR I COULD STEP INTO THE SPOTLIGHT, IN WHICH CASE I’D HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY NEW EVERY SEASON, AND THAT REALLY INTIMIDATED ME.” HE PAUSES: “BUT IT’S NOT INTIMIDATING ANYMORE. BECAUSE I LEARNT HOW TO EXTEND THAT VISION. AND ALSO WHAT WAS REALLY GREAT, AND WHAT I’M VERY GRATEFUL FOR, IS THAT SOMEHOW THE FASHION WORLD DECIDED TO TOLERATE MY PACE. AND MY PACE IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY’S ELSE’S.” HERE, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE INTERVIEW, I SUSPECT OWENS IS BEING A MITE DISINGENUOUS. AS WHEN, SHORTLY LATER, HE REFLECTS ON HIS RECENT CFDA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD BY SAYING: “THAT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I’D NEVER REALLY ENGAGED IN THE FASHION WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK, AND I THOUGHT I WAS INVISIBLE.” PSHAW. AMERICAN FASHION IS SHORT ON ORIGINALS, AND WHEN IT PRODUCES THEM THEY TEND TO DEFINE LOOKS THAT ARE INHERENTLY CONSERVATIVE TEMPLATES – SOMETHING WHICH APPLIES, TO BE FAIR, TO MUCH OF FASHION. OWENS IS THE EXCEPTION TO THAT, SO HOW COULD THE CFDA NOT WANT TO CLAIM HIM AS ONE OF ITS OWN? AND WHILE HIS GREY, BLACK-AND-WHITE AESTHETIC HAS REMAINED A LANGUAGE AS FUNDAMENTALLY CONSISTENT AS PALLADIO’S (ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN FLASHES OF DISSENT VIA PUTTY AND PINK ALONG THE WAY), HIS COLLECTIONS AND SHOWS HAVE ALWAYS FEATURED HANDBRAKE VARIATIONS IN BOTH THEME AND EXECUTION: ENOUGH TO KEEP EVEN THE SHORTEST ATTENTION SPAN FOCUSED. RECENT EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE STOMPING STEP TEAM SHOW OF SPRING 2014 WOMENSWEAR, THE P NIS-FLASHING AUTUMN/WINTER 2015 “SPHINX” MENSWEAR SHOW (A FASHION-FLASHINGLY BOLD DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN A CORPORATE WORLD), THE MONUMENTAL “DIRT” COLLECTION OF SPRING 2018 (WHOSE LAND-ART-INSPIRED STAGING WAS SET TO MAKE THE AUDIENCE FEEL LIKE THE INSIGNIFICANT SPECKS IN THE UNIVERSE WE ARE), AND THIS SUMMER’S SMOKE-FUMED MEN’S COLLECTION OF “BRUTALIST SEQUIN”-ETCHED OWENSWEAR SET AROUND A FLAME-ENGULFED TOWER OF BABEL. THESE ARE HARDLY THE WORK OF A CREATIVE WALLFLOWER. SHOWTIME, SAYS OWENS: “IS ONE OF THE CALMEST TIMES; BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE COLLECTION TOGETHER I DON’T HAVE ANY LOOSE ENDS, I DON’T CHANGE MY MIND AND I DON’T FREAK OUT. I DON’T FEEL PRESSURE AND IN FACT I LOVE THE SENSE OF PURPOSE THAT THAT RHYTHM OF SHOWS GIVES YOU. I’M GRATEFUL FOR IT, BECAUSE WE’VE ALL SEEN WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY LEAD AIMLESS LIVES. IT ENDS IN TEARS. SO TO ALWAYS HAVE DEADLINES IS PERFECT. IT DIVIDES YOUR LIFE INTO CHEWABLE SEGMENTS.” DOES HE REALLY NEVER FREAK OUT? “I GO WITH THE FLOW AND DO WHAT FEELS RIGHT, TRUSTING THAT THERE’S A REASON FOR IT, AND THAT SOMEHOW MY SUBCONSCIOUS HAS ACCUMULATED A COMPOSITION – A RECIPE – THAT MAKES SENSE… I NEVER LOOK AT IT AND THINK ‘THIS IS GOING TO BLOW EVERYONE AWAY’, AND I NEVER LOOK AT IT THINKING ‘THIS IS KIND OF SUB-PAR’. USUALLY I THINK ‘THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TRAJECTORY OF WHAT I’VE BEEN DOING’.” SO HOW TO SKETCH THAT EQUATION TO CRACK THE CODE OF OWENS&#39;S ORIGINALITY? HOW ABOUT (AS A WORKING DRAFT): CLOISTERED YOUTH + HIGH CULTURE + CATHOLIC IMAGERY X DISSOLUTION ÷ REDEMPTION, √ GRIME OVER GLAMOUR ... ALL AS A SUBSET OF AN INTRINSICALLY UNCONVENTIONAL SOUL? THAT OWENS DRAWL PLAYS OUT A FINAL LINE: &quot;IF THAT&#39;S THE SUMMARISATION, THEN THANK YOU! BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DESIGNER I WANTED TO BE WITHOUT EVER HAVING A GAME PLAN.&quot; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

ANYTHING MORE WOULD JUST GET TOO CHEAP AND DISAPPOINTING.” THOUGH WE’D NEVER SAY NO TO MORE CONTENT FROM MR RICK OWENS, WE GET HIS POINT. AS A CLOTHING DESIGNER, MR OWENS IS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME IDIOSYNCRATIC GREATS, HAVING PUT TOGETHER A BODY OF WORK THAT IS VIRTUALLY UNIMPEACHABLE. HIS SCULPTURE, FURNITURE AND OTHERWISE UNCLASSIFIABLE ART (SOME OF WHICH, INCLUDING THE MIXED-MEDIA “TURD” MADE UP OF HIS HAIR AND SAND FROM HIS BELOVED LIDO BEACH IN VENICE, WAS INCLUDED IN THE RETROSPECTIVE OF HIS WORK IN MILAN LAST YEAR) IS SINGULAR AND ASTONISHING. HIS BOOKS – LARGE-FORMAT, COFFEE-TABLE TOMES – ARE MEMORABLE, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE IMAGERY. IN FACT, ONE MIGHT SAY MR OWENS IS AMONG THE BEST WRITERS IN THE FASHION BUSINESS (ANYONE WHO HAS EVER READ HIS SHOW NOTES, WHICH HE WRITES HIMSELF, WILL RECOGNISE THE DELICACY, SLY HUMOUR AND OFTEN PROFOUND THOUGHTS ILLUMINATED IN HIS VIVID, ALL-CAPS WRITING). THIS MONTH, MR OWENS IS RELEASING TWO MORE INTO THE CANON. FIRST UP: RICK OWENS, A COMPILATION OF HIS LOOKBOOKS, WITH PHOTOGRAPHS BY MS DANIELLE LEVITT TAKEN FROM BEHIND THE SCENES ON SHOW DAYS. THEN LEGASPI: LARRY LEGASPI, THE 70S, AND THE FUTURE OF FASHION, ABOUT THE DESIGNER WHO CREATED THE SIGNATURE LOOKS OF A RANGE OF ARTISTS – FROM MR GEORGE CLINTON TO KISS – IN WHICH MR OWENS INTERVIEWS MS PATTI LABELLE AMONG OTHERS. ON THE OCCASION OF THE DUAL RELEASE, WE CHATTED WITH MR OWENS ABOUT HIS READING HABITS, WHY HE NEVER KEEPS DUST JACKETS AND WHO INSPIRES HIM. WHAT BOOKS DO YOU HAVE BY YOUR BED? BIOS OF JOSEF HOFFMANN, AND NAZIMOVA, THE WORKS OF ELIEL SAARINEN AND OTTO WAGNER, AND A GORGEOUS FIRST EDITION OF THE MUSIC AND WORDS TO RICHARD STRAUSS’ OPERA SALOME THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY THE MODEL AND JOURNALIST CORDULA REYER. BUT, I ACTUALLY NEVER READ IN BED – I JUST CHAIN SMOKE AND WATCH OLD MOVIES. HOW DO YOU SHOP FOR BOOKS? I’M NOT MUCH OF A BOOKSTORE BROWSER, BUT, SAYING THAT, I CAN NEVER RESIST A MUSEUM BOOKSTORE. I THINK I FOLLOW ONE BOOK TO ANOTHER. FOR INSTANCE, THE JAMES LORD BOOK SIX EXCEPTIONAL WOMEN PROBABLY LED ME TO THE JOHN RICHARDSON BOOK SACRED MONSTERS, SACRED MASTERS, WHICH MAYBE LED ME TO GLENWAY WESCOTT, AND SO ON. I COME ACROSS PEOPLE I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT AND THEN ORDER ONLINE. I ACCUMULATE STACKS OF BOOKS. I SAVE UP FOR THE BEACH, WHICH IS WHERE I REALLY DO MY READING – THERE, AND ON FLIGHTS AND TRAINS WHERE I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY TO ANSWER EMAILS OR PRODUCTION QUESTIONS. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DRAWN SO HEAVILY TO BIOGRAPHIES THESE DAYS? WHAT ARE SOME RECENT FAVOURITES? I THINK MY EARLIER YEARS WERE ABOUT ABSORBING IMPRESSIONS, EXPRESSIONS – MALLARMÉ, MAUGHAM, COLETTE AND, OH YES, A YOUNG, EARNEST AYN RAND MOMENT – BUT MY CURRENT YEARS ARE ABOUT CREATING MY OWN EXPRESSIONS. AND I THINK MY CURRENT FOCUS ON READING ALL THOSE CREATIVE BIOS IS TO CHECK ON HOW OTHERS NAVIGATED A CREATIVE LIFE TO SEE IF I’M DOING IT RIGHT. I SEEM TO CONCENTRATE ON CREATORS FROM THE 1930S AND 1940S (MY PREFERRED AESTHETIC PERIOD), WHERE I CAN SEE A FULL AND CONSISTENT COMMITMENT TO A RESOLVED CREATIVE ARC. BUT I DO LOVE FRIVOLITY. I AM CURRENTLY TICKLED BY THE WRITING OF TH ROBSJOHN-GIBBINGS, THE 1940S ARCHITECT AND FURNITURE DESIGNER, WHO WROTE IMPERIOUS OBSERVATIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND MODERN ART. I WILL ALWAYS ENDORSE THE MAPP AND LUCIA SERIES BY EF BENSON AS A CLASSIC IN PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE PETTINESS. AND, IN MY NINETIES, I AM GOING TO READ BEVERLEY NICHOLS’ WORK EXCLUSIVELY – GIDDY 1920S GARDENING BOOKS THAT ARE ABOUT ELEGANTLY BEMUSED LIVING, BUT OCCASIONALLY DROP A CASUALLY PROFOUND ASIDE. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT YOUR AVERSION TO DUST JACKETS – WHAT’S THAT ABOUT? I ALWAYS TAKE THE DUST JACKETS OFF BOOKS WHEN I BUY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW MINE AND I AM GOING TO USE THEM UP LIKE TOOTHPASTE OR SCENTED CANDLES. THE SHINY DUST-COVER GRAPHICS USUALLY JUST LOOK LIKE GARISH ADVERTISING TO ME AND I LOVE FOR THE COLOURS ON THE CLOTH COVERS TO FADE, TOO. I SPILL COFFEE ON THEM AND DRIP SEAWATER ON THEM AND I FOLD THE PAGES AS PAGE MARKS. DO YOU EXCLUSIVELY READ PHYSICAL BOOKS? YOU DON’T HAVE A KINDLE HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN YOUR BAG, DO YOU? I CAN’T GET USED TO READING DIGITALLY. I LOVE THE IDEA OF CONDENSED CONVENIENCE, BUT NEED THE EXPANSIVE LUXURY OF A BOOK I CAN SMELL. MR JORIS-KARL HUYSMANS’ NOVEL À REBOURS WAS A MOMENTOUS BOOK IN YOUR LIFE. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE BOOK THAT SO STRUCK YOU? HAS YOUR ESTIMATION OF IT CHANGED AT ALL IN THE TIME SINCE? THIS BOOK GAVE ME LICENSE TO UNAPOLOGETICALLY PURSUE AND WALLOW IN SELFISH EXQUISITE PLEASURES OF THE SENSES. RIGOROUSLY. AND I LIKED THAT THE PROTAGONIST IS BASED ON ROBERT DE MONTESQUIOU, WHO WAS ALSO THE INSPIRATION FOR PROUST’S BARON DE CHARLUS (WHICH THEN LED ME TO THE ROBERT DE MONTESQUIOU BIO, PRINCE OF AESTHETES, WHICH, OF COURSE, I HAD TO READ). À REBOURS HAS AN ART NOUVEAU SHOPPING LIST QUALITY SIMILAR TO AMERICAN PSYCHO’S 1980S SHOPPING LIST VIBE, WHICH REMINDS ME THAT I OUGHT TO REREAD HUYSMANS’ LÀ-BAS. WHAT IS THE BEST BOOK ABOUT FASHION OR A DESIGNER? WHO WRITES PARTICULARLY WELL ABOUT FASHION? I ACTUALLY RARELY BUY BOOKS ON FASHION, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE OFTEN SENT TO ME. I RECENTLY DID A PREFACE FOR A BOOK ON CHARLES JAMES THAT I WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT BECAUSE IT HAD A GREAT BALANCE OF SALACIOUSNESS AND REAL ACADEMIC RESEARCH. HE MAY NOT BE A WRITER OF BOOKS, BUT THE CURATOR OLIVIER SAILLARD’S PERSPECTIVE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE POETIC AND SMART. AND ANGELO FLACCAVENTO’S OBSERVATIONS ARE ALWAYS PERCEPTIVE AND TART WITHOUT GETTING SNARKY. TIM BLANKS’ SCOPE OF REFERENCES IS THRILLING. WHICH BOOKS WOULD WE BE SURPRISED TO FIND ON YOUR SHELVES? THERE ARE A FEW BOOKS I HAVE A COPY OF IN EACH OF MY PLACES: DORNACH DESIGN ABOUT ANTHROPOSOPHICAL DESIGN; IRWIN: RETROPRINCIP 1983-2003, A MONOGRAPH FROM THE SLOVENIAN ART COLLECTIVE; ELIEL SAARINEN BY ALBERT CHRIST-JANER; ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS: L’OEUVRE COMPLÈTE, AND THE APES OF GOD BY WYNDHAM LEWIS. WHAT BOOK DO YOU WISH EXISTED? AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE RECENT BIO OF CHARLES AND MARIE-LAURE DE NOAILLES. HOW DID THE LEGASPI BOOK COME ABOUT? THE LEGASPI BOOK IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING OF AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BECAUSE I HAVE EDITED AND ART-DIRECTED HIS LIFE INTO THE BLACK AND WHITE MELODRAMATIC THEATRICAL PIECE I WANTED IT TO BE, EMPHASISING THE FACETS I WAS INTERESTED IN AND CALLOUSLY IGNORING THE ONES I WASN’T. THE FACT THAT HE TOOK A FRITZ LANG FUTURISTIC SHOWGIRL AESTHETIC AND APPLIED IT TO BLACK SOUL CULTURE WITH LABELLE IN THE 1970S, AND THEN MIDDLE-AMERICA STADIUM METAL WITH KISS AFTER THAT, THRILLED AND INSPIRED THIS SMALL-TOWN SISSY TO BLAST FREE AND FIND HIS WAY. WHAT IS THE BEST BOOK YOU EVER RECEIVED AS A GIFT? THE SUPER STYLIST PANOS YIAPANIS HAS STOOD BY MY SIDE FOR 60 RUNWAY SHOWS. I HAVE ALWAYS CALLED HIM “PANSY” AND HE HAS ALWAYS CALLED ME “MARY”. KNOWING THIS, THE BRILLIANT EDITOR AND WRITER JO-ANN FURNISS RECENTLY GAVE ME A JOAN CRAWFORD AUTOBIOGRAPHY – A DELICIOUSLY CRINGE-INDUCING BOOK – INSCRIBED “TO MARY” IN CRAWFORD’S OWN ACTUAL HANDWRITING.

MANY OF HIS EARLY PIECES FELT ELEMENTAL – MONOLITHIC BLACK AND WOOD SEATS WHICH FUSED GRAPHIC SHAPES WITH ORGANIC MATERIALS SUCH AS DEER ANTLERS – AND ARE FAR BEYOND YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL FURNITURE, BORDERING ON SCULPTURE AND GARNERING ATTENTION IN THE ART WORLD, AS WELL AS SHOWS AT MOCA LOS ANGELES. WHEN SPEAKING TO OWENS ABOUT HIS APPROACH TO INTERIORS AND FURNITURE, WHAT IS STRIKING IS HIS LITERACY IN THE LAST 50 YEARS OF ART; HIS WORK BLENDS PUNK WITH MINIMALISM, THE ABSTRACTION OF FRANK STELLA WITH THE EDGE OF CULT NEW YORK ARTIST STEVEN PARRINO. THE DESIGNER’S LATEST EXHIBITION – TITLED GLADE, ON SHOW AT CARPENTER’S WORKSHOP GALLERY IN LONDON NOW – WAS PRODUCED BY HIS WIFE, CREATIVE COLLABORATOR AND BUSINESS PARTNER MICHÈLE LAMY AND QUIETLY REIMAGINES THE POSSIBILITIES OF INTERIORS. THE IMPETUS FOR HIS APPROACH TO SPACE IS FIRMLY ROOTED IN 20TH-CENTURY DESIGN; THE WORK IN THIS EXHIBITION SPECIFICALLY CALLS UPON 1960S BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE AND INTERIORS. “I THINK I STARTED FROM BRUTALISM AND THEN MERGED IT INTO ARTE POVERA, MUCH LIKE MY ATTRACTION TO ART DECO MERGED INTO ART NOUVEAU. WHAT’S FUNNY IS THAT MY PERSONAL PROGRESS WAS THE REVERSE OF THEIR ACTUAL HISTORICAL PROGRESSION,” OWENS TELLS ANOTHER. “THERE IS A GIUSEPPE PENONE ROOM LINED WITH LAUREL LEAVES AT THE CENTRE POMPIDOU THAT WE RETURN TO AGAIN AND AGAIN. WE BOTH AGREE THAT THAT ROOM, ATTACHED TO THE JOSEPH BEUYS FELT ROOM, WITH A CARL ANDRE ZINC PLATE FLOOR, WOULD MAKE THE IDEAL HOME.” FEATURING SCULPTURAL HEAD PIECES FROM THE DESIGNER’S SPRING/SUMMER 2020 COLLECTION, PRESENTED AT PARIS FASHION WEEK LAST MONTH, GLADE ALSO REFLECTS A STRONG CONNECTION TO NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. “ALL OF THIS IS LINKED BY A SENSE OF LIVING INSULATION THAT I LIKENED TO GLADE IN A FOREST,” HE SAYS. “A CLEARING THAT WAS AT ONCE WOMB-LIKE AND GRAND.” YET THE WORK FEELS VERY MODERN, TOO: OWENS INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY INTO THESE DESIGNS – LIGHTING, WIFI AND PHONE CHARGERS. “THE DIGITAL AGE IS PART OF EVOLUTION AND THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION AND SELF-AWARENESS IS THE MEANING OF LIFE,” HE EXPLAINS. “THE TOOLS TO GET THERE ARE A FORM OF ART.” OVER THE YEARS, OWENS HAS DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF SIGNATURE MATERIALS – CONCRETE, BONE AND INTERESTINGLY TEXTURED FRENCH WOOL ARMY BLANKETS – WHICH FOR HIM CONTAIN METAPHORICAL RESONANCE. “THE RELICS OF WAR ARE A REMINDER OF THE FRAGILITY OF PEACE AND PROTECTION AND REMIND US TO VALUE OUR SAFETY AND SECURITY,” HE SAYS. HIS SIGNATURE CHAIR IS THE ‘PRONG SEAT’, MADE FROM ALUMINIUM, WITH A DISTINCTIVE CURVED SHAPE WITH LINES PROTRUDING FROM ITS FORM. “WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE FURNITURE COLLECTION, OUR MANIFESTO WAS TO REDUCE OUR NEEDS TO A FUR ON A ROCK NEXT TO A FIRE IN A CAVE. THESE PRONGS ARE OUR SIGNATURE ROCKS FACETED IN A VERY SPECIFIC COMBO OF CORNERS, CURVES AND PLANES THAT SPOKE TO US.” OWENS HAS DONE SOMETHING MANY FASHION HOUSES HAVE ATTEMPTED AND FAILED: CREATED WORK THAT IS VERY CREDIBLE IN BOTH THE FASHION, DESIGN, AND ART ARENAS. DESPITE CROSSING OVER INTO DIFFERENT WORLDS, HIS CONCEPT AND APPROACH REMAIN THE SAME AND TOTALLY UNCOMPRIMISING TO HIS VISION. “FURNITURE IS JUST AN OUTER LAYER OF A LOOK. AN EXTENDED PERSONAL EXPRESSION,” HE SAYS. “DOESN’T EVERYONE WANT TO CUSTOMISE THE SPACE AROUND THEM IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER? WE JUST TURNED IT INTO A PERSONAL GAME OF CATCH.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

AND EVEN IF YOU’RE NOT, YOU’VE PROBABLY CAUGHT WIND OF HIS CINEMATIC FASHION SHOWS, HIS ARRESTING ALIEN MODELS, OR AT LEAST THIS PHOTO OF HIM RIDING A LIME SCOOTER IN PARIS. IN THE 18 YEARS THAT OWENS HAS PUT ON RUNWAY COLLECTIONS, FIRST IN NEW YORK AND SINCE 2003 IN PARIS, THE DESIGNER HAS RISEN FROM A FRINGE ECCENTRIC TO ONE OF FASHION’S MOST ESSENTIAL, PROVOCATIVE, AND INSPIRING VOICES. AS HE TELLS IT, PART OF HIS SUCCESS IS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT FASHION IS RUTHLESS, WIPING OUT MOST OF HIS INDEPENDENTLY OWNED PEERS AND PUTTING THE CONGLOMERATES, WITH THEIR REVOLVING DOORS OF CREATIVE DIRECTORS, ON SHAKY FOOTING. HE’S JUST ABOUT THE LAST MAN STANDING—AND HE’S STANDING TALL IN 6.5-INCH PLATFORM BOOTS. NOW ISN’T JUST OWENS’S MOMENT BECAUSE HE’S SURVIVED, BUT BECAUSE HE’S STAYING ALIVE SO BEAUTIFULLY. HIS SPRING 2014 STEP SHOW WAS A BREAKTHROUGH. SINCE THEN, OWENS HAS ONLY WORKED HARDER, PUSHED FARTHER, AND GOTTEN BETTER. PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVITT HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO HAVE BEEN BACKSTAGE AT THE STEP SHOW, WHERE SHE WAS ASKED BY OWENS AND HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE DANCERS AND PHOTOGRAPH THEM FOR STILL PORTRAITS. “I THINK THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON THE STEP SHOW SPARKED SOMETHING IN HIM, SOMETHING HE LIKED IN HIMSELF OR IN THE WORK OR HOWEVER I CHOSE TO DOCUMENT THE SHOW, AND THAT’S WHAT OPENED THE DOOR TO OUR RELATIONSHIP,” LEVITT TELLS VOGUE. SHE’S BEEN BACKSTAGE AT EVERY SHOW SINCE, AND NOW HER ARRESTING PORTRAITS DEPICTING OWENS’S WORK IN ITS PUREST FORM HAVE BEEN COMPILED IN A NEW BOOK FROM RIZZOLI, RICK OWENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY DANIELLE LEVITT. “THE IMAGES THAT I MAKE, I BELIEVE, ARE OF THE MOMENT WHERE WHAT RICK THINKS, FEELS, AND WANTS TO PRESENT IS ACTUALLY SEEN. THIS IS RICK’S ENTIRE VISION AS DOCUMENTED BY ME,” SHE SAYS. LEVITT UNDERSTANDS THAT SHE’S BEEN PRESENT FOR A MAGICAL TIME IN THE RICKAISSANCE. “IT ACTUALLY GETS ME EMOTIONAL,” SHE SAYS, “BECAUSE HE GETS BETTER EVERY SEASON. HOW DOES HE DO THAT? I’M AN ARTIST, HE’S AN ARTIST, BUT HIS ARTISTRY—EVERY TIME I SEE IT, IT’S BETTER. EVERY. TIME. HE’S CONSTANTLY LEARNING AND HE’S ALWAYS PUSHING HIMSELF. WHERE DOES HE COME UP WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF? WHERE IS IT LIVING IN HIS HEAD? EVERY TIME I’M IN AWE OF HIS LEVEL OF ARTISTRY AND FOCUS.” ON THE MORNING OF HIS NEW YORK CITY BOOK SIGNING IN SEPTEMBER, OWENS REFLECTED ON LEVITT’S COMMENTS. “IT’S SIMPLY BECAUSE I BECAME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MY TOOLS AND I BECAME MORE PLAYFUL.” A TESTAMENT TO HIS UNBRIDLED PLAYFULNESS AND HIS UNFLINCHING WORK ETHIC: IN THE MONTH SINCE OUR CONVERSATION HE HAS SIGNED BOOKS IN FOUR COUNTRIES, SHOWN A SPRING 2020 COLLECTION OF PANNIER’D BALL GOWNS AND AZTEC HEADDRESSES, HOSTED A RAVE TO MARK THE LAUNCH OF HIS VEJA COLLABORATION, HOSTED ANOTHER RAVE TO BENEFIT THE CENTRE POMPIDOU, AND WILL, IN A COUPLE OF HOURS, RECEIVE THE SUPERSTAR AWARD FROM THE FASHION GROUP INTERNATIONAL HERE IN NEW YORK. IF OWENS’S CREATIVE OUTPUT OF LATE HAS SHOWN ANYTHING, IT’S EXACTLY HOW OPEN-MINDED, HOW WILLING TO EVOLVE, CHANGE, AND COLLABORATE HE REALLY IS. AT HIS HOWARD STREET STORE IN SEPTEMBER, OWENS ANNOUNCED, “I’M JUST GOING TO RAMBLE,” AND PROCEEDED TO DO EXACTLY THAT, DISCUSSING THE THINGS HE LIKES TO DO IN NEW YORK (VISIT THE NEW GAVIN BROWN ENTERPRISE), THE THINGS HE WANTED TO SEE AT FASHION WEEK (ONLY THE ROW, THOUGH HE DID LIKE LOOK 2 FROM OSCAR DE LA RENTA, AND IS GETTING INTO CDLM), AND THE TRIALS OF HIS NEW CAT, PIXIE, WHO WON’T STOP PEEING ON THE SAME SPOT OF HIS BLACK JACKET. THE CONVERSATION ZIGGED AND ZAGGED, FROM HIS WORK TO MY WORK, TO HIS LIFE TO MY LIFE, TO THE TV SHOWS WE’RE BINGEING ON AND THE PAPARAZZI FODDER I’M OBSESSED WITH. MAYBE HE SHOULD DO A PODCAST NEXT—IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. IN THE MEANTIME, HERE ARE EDITED HIGHLIGHTS FROM OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT STAYING ALIVE, MAKING IT REAL, AND HITTING YOUR STRIDE. WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THE WAY DANIELLE PHOTOGRAPHS YOUR WORK? MAYBE MY EYESIGHT IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE, BUT I LIKE THINGS VERY HIGH CONTRAST, VERY CRISP, AND VERY WELL-LIT. I THINK THERE IS A GREAT CLINICAL SIDE TO IT, BUT THEN THERE’S THIS UNDERLAYER OF EMOTION. THE MODELS ARE ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME KIND OF GESTURE THAT’S A LITTLE BIT HUMAN, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, A LITTLE BIT ENDEARINGLY AWKWARD. SHE JUST GETS SOMETHING OUT OF PEOPLE. I THINK SHE’S REALLY EASY TO BE WITH, AND SHE’S REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC. YOU CAN FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF RECKLESSNESS FROM HER; THAT’S APPEALING AND IT MAKES YOU WANT TO BE A LITTLE BIT RECKLESS. I SUSPECT THIS, I MEAN, FROM WHEN I WATCH HER PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE. I THINK SHE HAS GOOD MOM ENERGY PROBABLY, SO IT HELPS PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE. AND SHE’S NICE AND BRASH. IS THAT A GOOD WORD? YES, BRASH IS A GOOD WORD. IS IT AN UNFLATTERING WORD? NO, I THINK IT’S GOOD IN THIS CONTEXT. I DON’T THINK IT’S UNFLATTERING. YOU GUYS SHOULD USE HER. I LOVE HER. I LOVE HER WORK. MAKE IT HAPPEN. I’LL DO MY BEST! FROM THE IMAGES, IT SEEMS LIKE DANIELLE HAS CREATIVE CONTROL OVER THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHE MAKES. WHAT IS THAT LIKE FOR YOU, TO CEDE A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR OWN CREATIVE CONTROL TO HER? I’VE STYLED IT. IT’S BEHIND THE SCENES AT A RUNWAY SHOW, AND IT’S ALREADY AS ART DIRECTED AS I CAN GET IT BEFORE IT GOES ON THE RUNWAY. EACH MODEL IS AS DRESSED AS CLOSE TO PERFECTION AS I’LL EVER BE ABLE TO GET IT, SO IT’S NOT LIKE I’M REALLY TAKING ANY BIG RISKS. IT’S ALL PRETTY ORGANIZED AT THAT POINT. I JUST TRUST DANIELLE IS GOING TO CAPTURE THINGS. SO, YES, THERE’S AN ELEMENT OF TRUST—AND I’M NOT A VERY TRUSTING PERSON AT ALL, BUT I TRUST THAT IT’S GOING TO COME OUT FINE AND THERE’S GOING TO BE ENOUGH OPTIONS TO CHOOSE SOMETHING GOOD AND THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF THINGS TO EDIT FROM AND THERE’S ENOUGH WIGGLE ROOM FOR SOME PERSONALITY, AND SOME EMOTION, AND SOME OF DANIELLE’S MOTHER ENERGY. DO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE IMAGES WILL PLAY OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ON THE INTERNET? THEIR VIRALITY? NOT REALLY. I GUESS I DO PUT THEM ON INSTAGRAM, BUT I DON’T DO A LOT OF THEM, I THINK. I’M NOT ON INSTAGRAM MYSELF, BUT I APPRECIATE LOOKING AT THINGS GRAPHICALLY ON A SMALL SCREEN AND I’M CONSCIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS LOOKING GOOD FOR THIS GENERATION. IT’S NOT LIKE I’M DOING IT IN A CALCULATED WAY, BUT YOU SEE HOW THINGS GO ALONG AND YOU SEE WHAT THE WORLD FEELS LIKE. THE WAY THINGS LOOK GRAPHICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT TO ME. JUST THE WAY THAT I MAKE CLOTHES, I LIKE TO SEE THINGS JUTTING OUT A LOT, OR DRAGGING, OR TRAILING, OR EXTENDING. I LIKE TO SEE THE HUMAN FIGURE TAKING UP SPACE IN A DIFFERENT WAY, IN AN EXAGGERATED WAY, OR IN A FLAMBOYANT WAY. IT’S AN ARCHITECTURAL THING. JUST ONE GESTURE, ONE THING STICKING OUT, MAKES YOUR WHOLE SILHOUETTE LOOK DIFFERENT. I’M THINKING GRAPHICALLY ALREADY, SO THAT IS THE HARMONY ABOUT DANIELLE’S IMAGERY AND MY CLOTHES. IT GETS VERY SCULPTURAL. IT GETS MORE SCULPTURAL LATER ON [IN MY WORK], AND YOU CAN SEE THIS EVOLUTION OF SCULPTURE. THAT’S SIMPLY BECAUSE I BECAME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MY TOOLS AND I BECAME MORE PLAYFUL, I THINK. IT’S NOT LIKE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THEN, BUT WHEN I LOOK BACK ON IT, THAT’S HOW I ANALYZE IT. MAYBE I’M WRONG, BUT I THINK THAT’S WHAT HAPPENED. AFTER A WHILE, YOU HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE TO PLAY. IS THERE A REASON YOU WANTED TO DO THIS BOOK NOW AS OPPOSED TO WAITING UNTIL THE END OF THE DECADE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? IT WAS PROPOSED TO ME. IT WASN’T SOMETHING I PROPOSED. I PROPOSED THE LEGASPI BOOK AND RIZZOLI COUNTERED WITH, “CAN WE DO THIS TOO?” THEY SEEM TO THINK THIS HAS MORE . . . . . . COFFEE-TABLE APPEAL? I GUESS. I GUESS THE LEGASPI NAME WAS JUST TOO OBSCURE. I MEAN THAT BOOK WILL ONLY BE AN ODDITY, WHICH IS KIND OF WHY I LIKE IT. THAT’S MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT IT. BUT, YES, IF THIS MAKES A NICE COFFEE-TABLE BOOK I’M ALL FOR IT. I CAN’T REMEMBER HOW THE FRONT LOOKS. [OWENS CLOSES THE BOOK.] OH YEAH, NICE COFFEE-TABLE IMAGERY. WHEN I TALKED TO DANIELLE ON THE PHONE, SHE WAS SAYING SHE FELT LIKE SHE CAME INTO YOUR WORLD AT THE PERFECT MOMENT, RIGHT AS YOU WERE HITTING YOUR STRIDE. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT’S TRUE? MAYBE. THAT COULD VERY WELL BE TRUE. I’M GLAD SHE WAS ABLE TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE ONE OF MY MOST DEFINING MOMENTS, THAT STEP SHOW. I LOVE THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO COME IN ON THAT NOTE AND KEEP PROGRESSING FROM THAT PERIOD ON. THE TIMING WAS REALLY PERFECT. I’M TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT THE SHOWS WERE LIKE BEFORE THEN. I CAN’T! THERE WAS THE SHOW WITH THE FIRE BACKDROP AND THE ONE WITH THE FOAMING BUBBLES . . . OH YEAH. THEY WERE NICE. IT’S FUNNY HOW I STARTED OUT, I NEVER HAD REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT DOING RUNWAY SHOWS. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I WASN’T GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT UP AFTER A COUPLE OF SHOWS, THAT THE WORLD DEMANDED A LOT MORE EXCITEMENT THAN WHAT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO. IT’S KIND OF FUNNY HOW I’VE ENDED UP GROWING INTO IT, REALIZING THAT I DO LIKE BEING FLAMBOYANT AND DOING SPECTACULAR SHOWS. I HAD NEVER ANTICIPATED THAT. IT’S NOT LIKE I EVER DREAMED ABOUT COMING OUT FOR A BOW AT THE END OF MY RUNWAY SHOW IN PARIS. IT’S NOT LIKE I EVER, EVER THOUGHT OF THAT WHEN I WAS MAKING CLOTHES IN THE BEGINNING OR EVEN THINKING ABOUT MAKING CLOTHES. I DON’T KNOW IF I EVEN THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE. I DON’T REMEMBER. I REALLY DON’T REMEMBER. IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS BEEN A VERY NATURAL EVOLUTION, THOUGH, FROM THE EARLY SETS AND INSTALLATIONS TO EVERYTHING THAT YOU’VE DONE RECENTLY. YEAH. A BIG PART OF THAT IS THAT I JUST HAVE FANTASTIC PARTNERS THAT HAVE PROTECTED ME. WE’VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. WITHOUT THAT KIND OF BUBBLE TO ALLOW YOU TO FIND YOUR VOICE AND TO EXPRESS YOUR VOICE—IT’S HARD FOR ANYBODY TO REALLY PROVE THEMSELVES IN THREE SEASONS THE WAY THAT IS DEMANDED NOW. SO THAT’S WHERE I WAS LUCKY. I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE PROTECTION AND THAT’S WHAT GOT ME HERE. YOU KNOW, I KIND OF TELL MY PARTNERS, “YOU GUYS COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITH ANYBODY.” THERE ARE A LOT OF TALENTED PEOPLE OUT THERE, BUT THE HARD PART IS EXECUTION. GETTING IT FINISHED ON TIME AND AT THE RIGHT PRICE AND ALLOWING YOU TO KEEP GOING. ALL OF THAT STUFF IS SO ESSENTIAL. [AN ARIA REACHES ITS CLIMAX IN THE BACKGROUND.] THIS IS QUITE THE PLAYLIST! I’VE INFLICTED IT ON THEM AND NOW I’M KIND OF IRRITATED BY IT. IT’S KIND OF WILD. WITH THE LARRY BOOK THERE IS AN OBVIOUS INTENTION AND PURPOSE OF THE BOOK, IN A WAY. IT’S YOUR HOMAGE TO HIM . . . WHEN I DID THE LARRY BOOK, I JUST INTENDED IT AS A FUN, FLAMBOYANT, SILVER, BLACK, AND WHITE PERSONAL THING. ABOUT HALF WAY INTO IT, I FOUND OUT THERE WAS THIS MANUSCRIPT THAT HE HAD WRITTEN WHILE HE WAS DYING, AND THERE WAS HIS WIDOW AND HIS SISTER. THEY HADN’T BEEN CONNECTED IN A WHILE, SO THEY BECAME CONNECTED AGAIN, AND THE MANUSCRIPT BECAME AVAILABLE THROUGH HIS SISTER, WHICH WAS A NICE MOMENT FOR ALL OF US. IN THE MANUSCRIPT, IT WAS ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WHOLE IDEA WAS THAT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HIS VOICE IN THIS BOOK, BUT THE WHOLE THING JUST TURNED. THERE WAS THIS LAYER OF GRAVITAS THAT MADE THIS BOOK SO MUCH MORE PROFOUND THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. I WAS VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE HIS VOICE IN IT AND LET HIM BE HEARD. THAT WAS SOMETHING I HADN’T REALLY PLANNED ON. I DIDN’T REALLY FEEL LIKE I WAS PART OF THE AIDS GENERATION BECAUSE I WAS NOT AROUND. I FEEL LIKE I AM THE LAST PERSON TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT THIS STORY DID FEEL ABOUT A GENERATION THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE SURVIVED. IT FELT GOOD TO TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO DIDN’T HAVE A CHANCE TO BE HEARD. ALSO, HOW CRAZY THAT THIS DRAG QUEEN SENSIBILITY ENDED UP BEING IN MIDDLE-AMERICAN FOOTBALL FIELDS? I LOVE THAT! I LOVE THAT WE GOT SOME QUEEN CAMP IN HIGH SCHOOLS. [LAUGHS.] BUT I DON’T KNOW IF I RECOGNIZED IT AS THAT WHEN I SAW IT WHEN I WAS 13. WHEN WE WERE 13—YOU WEREN’T EVEN BORN, BUT WHEN WE WERE 13, I DON’T THINK THERE HAD BEEN HEAVY METAL LIKE THAT. OR I WASN’T AWARE OF IT. I FELT WITH KISS IT GOT MORE EVIL, SATANIC, AND SINISTER. THAT’S WHAT IT WAS LIKE THEN. LATER ON, LOOKING BACK, IT BECAME VERY CARTOONISH AND VERY SILLY, BUT THEN IT WAS REALLY MENACING—AT LEAST TO ME WHEN I WAS 13 IN PORTERVILLE. THAT WAS THRILLING, THAT MENACE. THE THING ABOUT THOSE COSTUMES IS THAT GRAPHICALLY THEY ARE SO RESOLVED. THE GRAPHICS AND THE PRESENTATION GAVE KISS AN AUTHORITY THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD OTHERWISE. IT WAS A UNIFORM THAT YOU BELIEVED IN. IT WAS CONVINCING. THE WHOLE THING WAS CONVINCING BECAUSE THE UNIFORM WAS SO RIGHT AND THERE WAS JUST THE PERFECT NOTE OF RIDICULOUSNESS THAT MADE IT CHIC. IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A 1940S WOMAN’S HAT, YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES THEY WERE JUST SO RIDICULOUS AND OVER THE TOP, BUT SHARP AND CHIC? I FEEL LIKE THAT IS WHAT’S HAPPENING IN FASHION, A LITTLE BIT, NOW. BECAUSE THERE WAS A MAGPIE SENSIBILITY FOR THE PAST, FOR A LONG TIME, THAT IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT THROWING EVERYTHING TOGETHER, EVERYTHING YOU’VE SEEN THROUGH ALL THE GENERATIONS OF FASHION. [AN IDEA THAT] EVERYBODY HAS THEIR STYLE. THEY DON’T. BUT NOW, I THINK, WE’VE BECOME SO OVERSATURATED THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO BE SELECTIVE AND MAYBE [WHISPERS] ELITIST. BEING ELITIST IS COMING BACK IN A BIG WAY. IS IT? OH GOOD. ARE YOU ALLOWED TO SAY THAT THOUGH? I DON’T KNOW IF WE’RE ALLOWED TO SAY IT YET, BUT THERE’S SOMETHING HAPPENING WHERE STREETWEAR, ACCESSIBILITY, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF FASHION MADE FASHION AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE—WHICH WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING—BUT PEOPLE WANT TO PUSH AGAINST THAT DEMOCRATIZATION NOW, I THINK. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SPECIAL. IDEAS OF BEING SECRET, ELITE, BOURGEOIS ARE VERY COOL. I THINK IT HAS TO DO, AS WELL, WITH ALL THE PERVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH BEING BOURGEOIS. I KNOW, THE BOURGEOIS THING. OH, MY GOD. RICCARDO TISCI STARTED IT AT BURBERRY, AND THEN CELINE FOLLOWED, WHICH IS FUNNY ACTUALLY. YOU’RE RARELY IN NEW YORK, BUT DO YOU LIKE TO COME TO THIS STORE AND YOUR OTHER STORES AND JUST WATCH WHAT’S HAPPENING? I DID LAST WEEK, ACTUALLY, IN PARIS. I’VE NEVER REALLY SAT IN THERE FOR TWO HOURS WATCHING PEOPLE TRYING ON CLOTHES, BUT I WAS WITH A FRIEND’S MOTHER AND WE WERE GETTING HER SOMETHING. IT WAS FUN! I MEAN THE FIRST HALF HOUR I WAS KIND OF LIKE, “I CAN’T WAIT TO GET OUT OF HERE”; BUT THEN I EASED INTO IT, AND IT WAS ACTUALLY FUN—AND INFORMATIVE. IT MADE ME LOOK AT THINGS WITH A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. BUT I FEEL LIKE I DID LEARN THAT STUFF WHEN I WAS SELLING THE CLOTHES MYSELF, IN THE BACK OFFICE TO THESE BUYERS, SO I DO FEEL LIKE I DID HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT FROM WHEN I STARTED OF THE WAY THE BUSINESS WORKED. IT WAS VERY PERSONAL. I WAS JUST SCHLEPPING STUFF AROUND MYSELF AND IT WAS VERY RETAIL BASED. IT WAS ALWAYS RETAIL BASED AT THE BEGINNING WITHOUT THE FANTASY OF FASHION SHOWS. IT WAS JUST IN THE STORE. BUT IT IS NICE TO BE IN HERE. GOD, IT’S PRETTY ISN’T IT? DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE LIVES THAT YOUR PIECES HAVE AFTER YOU PART WITH THEM OR THE WAYS OTHER PEOPLE CONSUME YOUR PRODUCTS? I DON’T REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. IT’S ALWAYS A SURPRISE WHEN I SEE SOMETHING ON SOMEBODY. WHAT I LOVE IS BEING ON THE METRO IN BOLOGNA, UNDERNEATH THE CITY, AND SEEING SOMEBODY WEARING A KNOCKOFF OF MY STUFF. IT’S A THRILL. I’M THINKING, GOD, I REALLY DID INFLUENCE SOMETHING. IT’S NOT LIKE I CURED A DISEASE OR ANYTHING, BUT IN A VERY PRIMAL WAY IT’S VERY SATISFYING TO SEE THAT YOU HAD INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD AND THAT YOU ARE IMMORTALIZED BY PARTICIPATING. I MEAN, IMMORTALITY IS KINDA . . . [PAUSE] WELL, IT’S KIND OF WHAT WE’RE ALL INTO. WE ALL WANT TO BE IMMORTALIZED. IS THIS BOOK A DOCUMENT OF YOUR IMMORTALITY? SURE! YEAH. I REMEMBER TALKING WITH SOMEBODY FROM VOGUE, MAYBE IT WAS LYNN YAEGER, MAYBE IT WAS SALLY SINGER, AND I REMEMBER SAYING THAT IF I HAD GONE DOWN A DIFFERENT PATH . . . THE ONE THING I REGRET ABOUT NOT PURSUING A MORE TRADITIONAL ROUTE IN FASHION, MAYBE STAYING IN NEW YORK OR MAYBE JOINING A HOUSE AND BECOMING A BIGGER DESIGNER AT A BIGGER HOUSE, IS THAT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET AN IRVING PENN PORTRAIT OR IRVING PENN IMAGES OF MY CLOTHES. OR HORST IMAGES. OR AVEDON IMAGES. THOSE LEGENDARY PHOTOGRAPHERS, OR EVEN MORE CONTEMPORARY VERSIONS OF THAT. WELL, I ACTUALLY DO NOW HAVE STUFF, BUT NOT A LOT. I HAVE A COUPLE OF NICK KNIGHT IMAGES, A COUPLE OF STEVEN KLEIN IMAGES, A COUPLE OF JUERGEN TELLER IMAGES, BUT I NEVER REALLY BECAME PART OF . . . IF I HAD GONE DOWN A DIFFERENT PATH, I WOULD BE REMEMBERED MORE WITH AN AVEDON OR AN IRVING PENN PORTRAIT. I REMEMBER WHOEVER I WAS TALKING TO SAID, “WELL, ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO ABOUT THAT IS JUST DO BOOKS. JUST KEEP DOING BOOKS AND THAT’S GOING TO BE YOUR IMMORTALITY.” IT’S TRUE. IT’S NOT LIKE I ACTIVELY SET OUT TO DO THAT, BUT I AM VERY SATISFIED NOW THAT I WILL BE REMEMBERED THE WAY THAT I WANT TO BE. DO YOU FEEL ANY DISASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE YOU THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIALIZED THROUGH YOUR WORK, YOUR EXHIBIT, AND YOUR BOOKS AND THE YOU THAT IS, MAYBE, SITTING AT HOME CLEANING CAT PEE OFF YOUR JACKET? NOT REALLY, BECAUSE I TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING. IT’S ALL PART OF THE SAME STORY. ALL OF THE FLAWS IN MY LIFE, I’M PRETTY OPEN ABOUT. I TALK ABOUT ARTIFICE AND MY OWN ARTIFICE, SO I THINK IT’S ALL PRETTY EXPOSED. THAT’S ONE OF THE MAIN GISTS OF MY STORY, THAT YOU’RE ALLOWED TO INVENT YOURSELF. I THINK IT’S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO KNOW THAT YOU’RE FLAWED AND TO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT YOUR FLAWS TOO MUCH. TO WORK ON THEM, BUT KNOW THAT YOU’RE NEVER GOING TO FIX THEM AND IT DOESN’T MATTER AND 100 YEARS FROM NOW NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE. SO, I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANYTHING, REALLY, THAT I’VE GOT HIDDEN THAT RUINS THE STORY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BRINGING NEW PEOPLE INTO YOUR WORLD, WORKING WITH DANIELLE OR MAKING A BOOK ABOUT LARRY, HOW AWARE ARE YOU OF THE RICK OWENS EFFECT? ANY ASSOCIATION WITH YOU IMMEDIATELY LEGITIMIZES SOMEONE, SOME THING, OR THEIR ART. DOES IT? I THINK SO. IT’S NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY. DANIELLE IS ALREADY AN INCREDIBLY ACCOMPLISHED AND WELL-RESPECTED PHOTOGRAPHER, BUT HAVING YOUR STAMP OF APPROVAL BRINGS HER TO A NEW AUDIENCE. WELL, THERE’S GOING TO BE CERTAIN YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO GET A CERTAIN LEVEL OF LEGITIMACY AND THEN I MIGHT BE LEGITIMIZED BY ASSOCIATION WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. THERE WAS AN ARTICLE, IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY, BECAUSE I HAD JUST DONE THIS PROJECT WITH THOMAS HOUSEAGO [FOR THE SPRING 2020 MEN’S SHOW]. THEY ERECTED HIS SCULPTURE WHERE I USUALLY DO MY SHOW, SO MY SHOW WOULD HAVE TO LITERALLY REVOLVE AROUND HIS SCULPTURE. I LOVE THOMAS HOUSEAGO, SO I APPROACHED HIM AND ASKED HIM IF WOULD HE CONSIDER PARTICIPATING MORE IN MY SHOW. HE CAME HIMSELF AND DID THIS CLAY INSTALLATION ALL OVER THE RUNWAY AND I REMEMBER READING SOMETHING AFTERWARDS ABOUT “SOMETIMES A TIRED DESIGNER NEEDS TO LEGITIMIZE HIMSELF WITH THE GLAMOUR OF A FAMOUS ARTIST.” FAIR ENOUGH. I DID FEEL GLAMOROUS WORKING WITH THOMAS HOUSEAGO. HE’S A MAJOR—HE’S GOING TO BE A PART OF ART HISTORY. THERE’S ALL SORTS OF LAYERS OF LEGITIMACY HAPPENING. I’M ALSO CONSCIOUS THAT THERE CAN BE SOME PEOPLE THAT THIS IS NOT THEIR CUP OF TEA AND THEY’RE ROLLING THEIR EYES LIKE, “OH, THE RICK OWENS THING.” I GET THAT. I DON’T ALWAYS ASSUME [BEING ASSOCIATED WITH ME] IS A GOOD THING. I THINK IT’S A GOOD THING. I FEEL, ALSO, THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF EVALUATING ME IN THIS DAY AND AGE COMPARED TO ALL OF THE CARNAGE OF ALL OF THE DESIGNERS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN WIPED OUT. THAT IS MAKING SOMEONE LIKE ME, WHO HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AND STAYED IN THEIR OWN LANE, IT’S MAKING ME LOOK MORE RARE THAN BEFORE. IT’S PROBABLY ENHANCING MY REP JUST BY ENDURANCE. DO YOU LOOK AT ALL THE SHOWS? I LOOK AT A LOT. IT’S FUN. AND YOU DON’T, WELL, WORRY, THAT IT WOULDN’T INFILTRATE YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS? IT DOES. I’M SURE IT DOES. I’M SURE I’M LOOKING AT A LOT OF WHAT NOT TO DO, A LOT OF WHAT’S OUT THERE, AND WHAT’S BEEN DONE TOO MUCH. BUT YOU CAN FIND PLEASING LINES ANYWHERE. I CAN FIND THEM ON THE METRO, THE WAY SOMEONE HAS THEIR SHIRT TIED AROUND THEIR HIPS. YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING. I’M ALWAYS LOOKING AT WHAT PEOPLE DO. I’M THINKING COMMERCIALLY TOO: THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WORKS; THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BUY; HOW DO WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? I AM CONSCIOUS OF THAT SOMETIMES. NOT A LOT, BUT I AM KIND OF PRACTICAL. IT’S NOT JUST ALL POETIC WHIMSY AND DEEP THOUGHTS. SOMETIMES IT’S JUST WHAT’S OUT THERE THAT LOOKS RIGHT, MAKES SENSE, OR LOOKS LOGICAL. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE IT’S GOING TO COME FROM. SOMETIMES SOMEBODY’S GOING TO DO A SKIRT, AND I’LL THINK THAT’S KIND OF FLATTERING, THAT LOOKS GOOD FOR RIGHT NOW. I DON’T KNOW. THERE’S INSPIRATION EVERYWHERE. Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

THOUGH CALLING HIM A FASHION DESIGNER SEEMS ALMOST LIMITING – SURE HE DESIGNS CLOTHES, SHOES AND ACCESSORIES, BUT HE DESIGNS FURNITURE TOO, AND THE WORLD HE HAS CREATED FEELS EXACTLY LIKE THAT: A WORLD OWENS – OR THE “FERAL WARRIOR KING” AS TIM BLANKS CALLED HIM IN THE A/W19 ISSUE OF ANOTHER – HAS BEEN DESIGNING TRAINERS FOR YEARS. IN 2017, HOWEVER, HE APPROACHED ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRAINER BRAND VEJA ABOUT A COLLABORATION. “RICK CONTACTED US NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO. WE WERE STRUCK BY THE HUMILITY AND THE CURIOSITY OF HIS TEAM,” VEJA’S CO-FOUNDER SEBASTIEN KOPP TELLS ANOTHER MAN. “WE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH RICK HIMSELF AND HIS TEAM. THINGS WENT VERY SMOOTHLY, IT WAS AS IF BOTH SIDES WERE IMPRESSED WITH EACH OTHER: HE IS ONE OF THE MAIN FIGURES IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, A FREE SPIRIT, AND WE’RE A GROWING COMPANY.” AVAILABLE IN “BUTTER-BEIGE, BLACK AND EXCLUSIVE ‘DUST’ GREY,” THE RESULTING VEJA X RICK OWENS TRAINER IS PLAIN AND MINIMALIST, MARRYING BOTH OWENS’ AESTHETIC AND VEJA’S DEVOTION TO SUSTAINABILITY – THE SOLE IS 45 PER CENT BIO-BASED AND COMPOSED OF BANANA OIL, SUGAR CANE AND RICE HUSK, WHILE THE ‘L-FOAM CUSHION’ IS 50 PER CENT BRAZILIAN NATURAL RUBBER. IN FACT, IT’S THIS DEVOTION TO SUSTAINABILITY THAT FIRST DROVE OWENS TO APPROACH VEJA ABOUT THE COLLABORATION. HUMBLE, JUST LIKE KOPP SAYS, THE DESIGNER IS THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT HIS OWN BRAND HAS A LONG WAY TO GO IN THIS AREA, AND THAT HE HIMSELF BEARS SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RISE OF SNEAKER CULTURE – AN ESPECIALLY CONSUMPTIVE SECTOR OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY. “I MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF A CURRENT SNEAKER CULTURE THAT BEGAN AS NICHE AND THEN DEVELOPED INTO A STORY ABOUT CONSUMPTION AND STATUS...” OWENS TELLS ANOTHER MAN. “MAYBE GOING IN A MORE RESPONSIBLE DIRECTION MIGHT BE SMARTER... I RESEARCHED THE MOST ECOLOGICAL SNEAKER BRAND I COULD FIND AND ENDED UP AT VEJA. I’M THE LAST PERSON TO HAVE ANY AUTHORITY PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY BUT THAT’S THE MESSAGE – WE CAN ALL START SOMEWHERE. I HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO ROLL MY EYES AT THE HYPE AROUND SUSTAINABILITY, BUT EVEN IF IT’S HYPE, IT’S HYPE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.” “THE CYNIC IN ME SUSPECTS THAT WE MIGHT BE TOO LATE AND THAT THE HUMAN URGE TO PROCREATE IS JUST GOING TO OVERWHELM ANY FEATURES OF RESTRAINT, BUT MAYBE PEOPLE LIKE SEBASTIEN CREATING COMPANIES LIKE VEJA WILL FIND A WAY TO DIVERT EVOLUTION,” HE CONTINUES. “I HOPE SO. REGARDLESS, MINDFULNESS AND CONSIDERATION ARE VALUES I ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSE AND HITCHING MY TOXIC WAGON TO VEJA’S PURE PONY IS ONE OF MY FIRST STEPS...” A “PURE PONY” IS A GOOD WAY TO DESCRIBE VEJA, WHICH PRIORITISES TRANSPARENCY, ORGANIC MATERIALS AND FAIR-TRADE SOURCING MORE THAN ANY OTHER TRAINER BRAND, ENSURING THAT EACH AND EVERY STAGE OF PRODUCTION IS AS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE. AND YET THEY’RE NOT SATISFIED, STILL PUSHING TO REDUCE THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THEIR DESIGNS. “WE HAVE MANY THINGS TO ACHIEVE,” SAYS KOPP. “AT THE MOMENT IT ISN’T PERFECT – IT’S A HUGE STEP TOWARDS ECOLOGICALLY CONSCIOUS RUNNING SHOES. BUT WE CAN ONLY USE 53 PER CENT BIOLOGICALLY DERIVED MATERIALS. WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS 100 PER CENT.” VEJA IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST OF FASHION WHICH, AS WE KNOW, IS ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTING INDUSTRIES IN THE WORLD. THE BRAND TAKES SUSTAINABILITY SERIOUSLY AND PROVES – IN THIS COLLECTION ESPECIALLY – THAT GREAT DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRACTICES AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

ON 17 OCTOBER, FASHION DESIGNER RICK OWENS WILL BRING HIS GLAMOUR-MEETS-GRUNGE AESTHETIC TO THE FIFTH FLOOR GALLERIES OF THE CULTURAL VENUE — HOME TO THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MODERN ART — WITH A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE. USING RICK OWENS FURNITURE AS THE STAGE, FIGURES FROM THE DESIGNER’S CREATIVE SPHERE WILL RESPOND TO THE WORKS OF ART ON DISPLAY BEFORE THE EVENING CULMINATES IN AN AFTER-PARTY. OWENS FOLLOWS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF PORTUGUESE VISUAL ARTIST DAVIDE BALULA, AND BEFORE HIM ITALIAN ARTIST AND FILMMAKER FRANCESCO VEZZOLI. BOTH WERE ALSO GRANTED CARTE BLANCHE OVER THE MUSEUM SPACE; THE LATTER COLLABORATED WITH THE PARIS OPERA ACADEMY TO CREATE AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THE POMPIDOU’S 40TH ANNIVERSARY IN 2017. ORGANISED BY FRIENDS OF THE CENTRE POMPIDOU, PROCEEDS FROM THE TICKETED EVENT WILL GO TOWARDS THE CENTURIES-OLD EFFORT TO GROW THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MODERN ART’S COLLECTIONS. IN 2018 ALONE, 120 WORKS WERE ACQUIRED THANKS TO THE NON-PROFIT ORGANISATION’S PATRONAGE. THE MUSEUM NOW BOASTS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY ART IN EUROPE. AHEAD OF THE REVELRY, OWENS REVEALS TO VOGUE HOW HE INTENDS TO EXERCISE HIS CREATIVE FREEDOM. TELL US ABOUT YOUR YOU X ART X CENTRE POMPIDOU (YACP) PROJECT — WHAT CAN VISITORS EXPECT? I STARTED WITH THE THOUGHT: “WHAT IS THE MOST RADICAL THING I CAN DO IN A SPACE FILLED WITH INCREDIBLE WORKS OF ART?” AND I CONCLUDED IT WAS TO BRING IN MY OWN WORKS OF ART. SO THERE WILL BE LIVING WORKS OF ART (PEOPLE I ADMIRE WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO CREATIVE EXPRESSION), STANDING ON WORKS OF ART (MY FURNITURE DESIGNS), RESPONDING TO WORKS OF ART (THE POMPIDOU’S COLLECTION). I WANT IT TO BE AN ART ORGY IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT (A MUSEUM). THE WHOLE THING IS REALLY COLLABORATIVE. I’M NOT CHOREOGRAPHING THE PERFORMERS OR TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO, I’M SIMPLY COMPOSING THEM. THEN, OF COURSE, IT’S ALSO A COLLABORATION WITH MY WIFE MICHÈLE [LAMY], WHO IS NURTURING THE RICK OWENS FURNITURE BUSINESS. WHILE I HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT I WANT, IT’S HER THAT SEES THE DESIGNS THROUGH. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOUR CREATIVE OEUVRE TO TRANSCEND FASHION INTO ART, INTERIOR DESIGN, PUBLISHING AND SO ON? I THINK A LOT ABOUT ENVIRONMENT WHEN I’M DESIGNING CLOTHES. I LOVE THE IDEA OF EVERYTHING CONNECTING AND BEING AUTHENTIC; THAT YOU WEAR AN OUTFIT THAT RELATES TO WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU LIVE AND HOW YOU LIVE — EVERYTHING COMPLETE AND RESOLVED. THERE’S A MORALITY TO IT WHICH HAS ALWAYS INTERESTED ME. DID THE IDEAS EXPLORED IN YOUR SPRING/SUMMER 2020 COLLECTION INFORM YACP IN ANY WAY? NOT LITERALLY, BUT LIKE I SAY, IT’S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THERE IS A CONSISTENT AESTHETIC THREAD THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT I DO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. MY LATEST COLLECTION TOOK INSPIRATION FROM MY MEXICAN HERITAGE ON MY MOTHER’S SIDE OF THE FAMILY, WHICH I HAVEN’T EXPLORED THAT MUCH BEFORE. I RECENTLY WENT TO SEE AN EXHIBITION AT THE PEGGY GUGGENHEIM COLLECTION IN VENICE ABOUT JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS’ TRAVELS THROUGH MEXICO AND THE COUNTRY’S INFLUENCE ON THEIR WORK. THEY SKETCHED THE PYRAMIDS AND DOCUMENTED AZTEC WRITING SYSTEMS. IT REALLY DELIGHTED ME BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY PLAYFUL, GERMAN INTERPRETATION OF MEXICO — A LENS VERY SIMILAR TO MINE, THE OPPOSITE OF A CLICHÉ. WHICH WORKS IN THE POMPIDOU CENTRE’S COLLECTION DO YOU FIND MOST INSPIRING? THERE’S AN INSTALLATION BY [ITALIAN ARTIST] GIUSEPPE PENONE IN WHICH ALL THE WALLS ARE LINED WITH LAUREL LEAVES BEHIND WIRE MESH. CLOSE TO THAT IS A JOSEPH BEUYS INSTALLATION [CALLED PLIGHT] AND THE WALLS ARE COVERED WITH GREY WOOL FELT, AND, IN ANOTHER ROOM, A FLOOR BY CARL ANDRE [144 TIN SQUARE]. I’VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THAT AS MY FANTASY HOME — A PENONE ROOM, A BEUYS ROOM, ALL THE FLOORS COVERED IN METAL TILES. WHAT IS IT THAT EXCITES YOU ABOUT CREATING WORK FOR A MUSEUM SETTING? MUSEUMS ARE SO COMPELLING TO ME — THEY ALL HAVE A LOADED HISTORY. JUST LOOK AT HOW MANY WORKS OF ART HAVE BEEN STOLEN, OR ARE THE SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY, OR HAVE BEEN CLAIMED AND RECLAIMED. TO ME, MUSEUMS REPRESENT THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, WICKEDNESS, ASPIRATION, WAR, GREED, CONFLICT AND, AT THE SAME TIME, BEAUTY. THEY’RE VERY SALACIOUS PLACES. HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THE MATERIALS FOR YOUR FURNITURE? THOUGHT THAT COMBINES SPIRITUALITY AND MATERIALITY FOR A BETTER HUMANITY] FOR SOME TIME — THE CLINICAL COMPOSITION OF ORGANIC MATERIALS REALLY APPEALS TO ME. I&#39;VE PUSHED THIS IDEA IN A MORE OPULENT DIRECTION BY USING ACRES OF ALABASTER AND MARBLE. SOME OF THE FURNITURE SHAPES ARE SO SIMPLE — I’VE INCORPORATED ANTLERS INTO THEM TO GIVE AN ORGANIC FLOURISH. ANTLERS REPRESENT GLORY TO ME — THEY’RE LIKE A CROWN. HOW DO THE IDEAS OF CONNECTIVITY AND AUTHENTICITY PLAY OUT IN YOUR OWN HOME? MY HOUSES ARE VERY BASIC USUALLY. ALL MY FURNITURE IS MADE FROM RUSTIC WOOD IN VERY SIMPLE GEOMETRIC SHAPES. I LOVE AN EXTRAVAGANT FLOOR; IN MY VENICE HOUSE, THE FLOOR IS MADE FROM SARDINIAN STONE, AND IN MY CONCORDIA HOUSE, I HAVE TRAVERTINE THROUGHOUT. I DON’T HANG ART ON THE WALLS; INSTEAD, ART NOUVEAU SCULPTURES ON PEDESTALS ARE SCATTERED AROUND. A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY WITH ME. ALTHOUGH I’M DRAWN TO MODERNIST ART, I LIKE ART NOUVEAU FOR ITS COMPLETE INDULGENCE AND SENSUALITY — ESPECIALLY WHEN IT’S PRESENTED IN SUCH AN AUSTERE SPACE. I’VE COME TO REALISE MY HOMES ARE PRETTY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL. I USED TO BE VERY INDULGENT AND AS THE YEARS HAVE GONE BY, I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE BEING CONTROLLED. THERE’S DEFINITELY A TEMPTATION OF COLLAPSING BACK INTO INDULGENCE AND I THINK THAT’S SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO. WE ALL THINK, “WHAT IF I JUST LET EVERYTHING GO AND DO WHATEVER THE F CK I WANT?” AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. THERE’S SOMETHING TITILLATING ABOUT RELINQUISHING CONTROL, BUT WE DON’T BECAUSE WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES. IT’S NOBLE BUT [TINGED] WITH REGRET, BECAUSE WE FEEL WE WOULD BE ENJOYING THINGS MORE IF WE DIDN’T HAVE TO BE IN CONTROL ALL THE TIME.

HOWEVER, HE LAUNCHED HIS CAREER (AND FOUNDED HIS EPONYMOUS LABEL) IN LOS ANGELES, A CITY HE HASN’T SET A PLATFORM-BOOTED FOOT IN FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND A HALF DESPITE OPENING A FLAGSHIP STORE HERE IN 2015. UNTIL LATE LAST WEEK, THAT IS. THAT’S WHEN OWENS AND HIS WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER, MICHÈLE LAMY, ARRIVED IN THE CITY OF ANGELS FOR A FIVE-DAY SWIRL OF ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDED CELEB-STUDDED DINNER PARTIES, REVISITING OLD HAUNTS AND RECONNECTING WITH OLD FRIENDS. THE VISIT CULMINATED MONDAY NIGHT IN A JAM-PACKED BOOK-SIGNING PARTY ON THE NIGHT OF OWENS’ 58TH BIRTHDAY AT OWENS’ LA BREA BOULEVARD BOUTIQUE FOR TWO RECENT RIZZOLI-PUBLISHED TOMES, “LEGASPI BY RICK OWENS,” ABOUT THE DESIGNER WHO INSPIRED OWENS’ FALL AND WINTER 2019 COLLECTION, AND THE PHOTO BOOK “RICK OWENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY DANIELLE LEVITT.” BETWEEN A ONE-ON-ONE, PREPARTY BOOK SIGNING WITH COMEDIAN DAVE CHAPPELLE (WHO HAD A FLIGHT TO CATCH) AND A FULL-BLOWN OWENS-FEST THAT HAD A LINE OF MORE THAN 100 BOOK BUYERS SNAKING OUT THE DOOR AND THROUGH THE PARKING LOT AT ANY ONE TIME, OWENS SAT DOWN WITH THE TIMES TO TALK ABOUT WHY HE’D STAYED AWAY FROM L.A. FOR SO LONG — AND WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO RETURN. HERE ARE EXCERPTS FROM THAT CONVERSATION. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO SINCE ARRIVING IN LOS ANGELES FOUR DAYS AGO? WE WENT TO HOLLYHOCK HOUSE, WHICH WAS REALLY LOVELY. IT WAS ONLY AFTER WE MOVED THAT I DEVELOPED AN INTEREST IN FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT — WHICH IS WEIRD — SO I’D NEVER BEEN THERE. WE’VE DONE EVERYTHING: GONE TO THE BEACH, GONE DOWNTOWN, GONE TO SOME MUSEUMS AND GONE BACK TO THE PLACES WE USED TO LIVE JUST TO LOOK AROUND. HOW HAS LOS ANGELES CHANGED SINCE YOU’VE BEEN GONE? MAYBE I’M [BEING] A LITTLE BIT OBLIVIOUS BECAUSE I KEEP THINKING THINGS HAVEN’T CHANGED THAT MUCH. PEOPLE SAY, “LOS ANGELES HAS CHANGED SO MUCH, [AND] THE TRAFFIC IS HORRIBLE NOW,” BUT [L.A.] SEEMS THE SAME AS IT ALWAYS WAS, AND THE TRAFFIC’S NOT THAT BAD. WHAT’S FUNNY IS THAT L.A. ACTUALLY FEELS A LITTLE SMALLER. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE BACK AFTER SO LONG? WHEN WE LIVED AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT 20-SOMETHING YEARS AGO, WE HAD A ROOM IN THE BACK OVER THE KITCHEN, AND THE ROOM WE’RE STAYING IN NOW IS TWO FLOORS ABOVE THAT ROOM AND HAS THE SAME CONFIGURATION. SO THERE’S BEEN THIS NOT-EMOTIONAL-BUT-NOSTALGIC-MEMORY-TRIGGER KIND OF THING HAPPENING BECAUSE WE’RE LIVING IN THAT DYNAMIC AGAIN TOGETHER, AND IT’S BEEN SUPER SWEET. WHEN WE OPENED THE WINDOWS THERE WAS THIS PARTICULAR SMELL — A COMBINATION OF PLANTS, ALLEY AND HOTEL — THAT TRIGGERED A LOVELY RUSH OF MEMORIES. SO YOU’RE ENJOYING IT? I’M REALLY ENJOYING IT. I WAS KIND OF DREADING COMING BACK TO L.A. A LITTLE BIT, AND IT’S BEEN VERY SWEET. THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE DRAMATIC, I GUESS, BUT I FEEL LIKE I’M BREAKING THE ICE AND I’M GOING TO BE HERE ALL THE TIME NOW. WHY, EXACTLY, WERE YOU GONE FOR SO LONG? IT’S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU SEE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF WITH WEIRD BANGS OR BRACES [AND] YOU KIND OF WINCE A LITTLE BIT AT YOUR VULNERABILITY. I THINK THAT WAS SORT OF WHAT I ASSOCIATED WITH LOS ANGELES — BEING NOT FULLY FORMED AND BEING KIND OF MESSY AND NOT WHO I WANTED TO BE COMPLETELY. SO I DIDN’T WANT TO REVISIT THAT SO MUCH. WHAT MADE THIS THE RIGHT TIME FOR A REVISIT? AFTER THE BOOK SIGNINGS IN SEOUL, PARIS, LONDON AND NEW YORK, I WAS THINKING, “THIS IS REALLY FUN! THIS WOULD BE A FUN THING TO DO IN L.A.,” [AND BECAUSE] I HADN’T BEEN TO L.A. [IN A LONG TIME] THIS WOULD BE A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE FINALE. BUT IT WASN’T LIKE WE PLANNED IT FROM THE BEGINNING. IT WAS KIND OF IMPROMPTU. THE GREAT THING IS IT’S LIKE HAVING A PARTY, AND IT’S A CHANCE TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE IN A VERY CLINICAL, CONTROL-Y WAY. I CAN HAVE ONE-ON-ONE TIME, DO A FACE-TO-FACE [MEETING] AND A SELFIE WITH EVERYBODY, WHICH IS A LITTLE CLINICAL BUT NICE. SO THAT WINCE-INDUCING VULNERABILITY AND FEELINGS OF BEING MESSY AND NOT FULLY FORMED ARE GONE? I WAS GOING TO A NIGHTCLUB FRIDAY AND I WAS REMEMBERING HOW, WHEN I WAS LIVING IN L.A., I WOULD HAVE THIS LITTLE BIT OF ANXIETY OR NERVOUSNESS BEFORE GOING OUT. AND NOW I’M 50-…-8. I WAS JUST SO RELAXED AND SO ENJOYING THE MOMENT, AND LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING. I WAS LIKE, “WELL, THAT’S 58. JUST KIND OF RELAX AND LEARN TO ENJOY IT.” I’VE GOTTEN PAST A LOT OF THE ANXIETIES. BUT I’M BEING A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I’M IN A DIFFERENT POSITION NOW AND I’M PRETTY SURE EVERYBODY’S GOING TO BE REALLY NICE TO ME. AND IT’S MY BIRTHDAY. SO WHAT’S TO WORRY ABOUT? SPEAKING OF BIRTHDAYS, DOES THAT FACTOR IN TO THE WAY YOU’RE FEELING ABOUT BEING BACK? THERE’S SOMETHING SATISFYING ABOUT BEING OLDER AND FEELING LIKE YOU’VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF DONE THAT YOU DIDN’T THINK YOU WERE GOING TO [GET DONE]. THERE’S A LOT OF GRATITUDE THAT I GET TO COME BACK UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN I EVER THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN. THAT PART IS VERY FULFILLING. REVISITING WHAT YOU [ONCE] CONSIDERED A WEAKNESS AND BEING SORT OF VALIDATED. IT’S ALMOST BIBLICAL, THIS RETURNING THING. DOES THIS MEAN YOU’LL BE VISITING LOS ANGELES MORE FREQUENTLY NOW? WE’RE LOOKING AT PROPERTY! WE ALWAYS DO THAT, THOUGH. [MICHÈLE AND I] WERE IN CAIRO A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND WE WERE LIKE, “WE’RE TOTALLY LIVING HERE.” BUT THAT WAS ANOTHER REASON I WAS IN NO RUSH TO GET BACK. … I CAN TOTALLY SEE [MYSELF] ENDING UP HERE. I MEAN IT’S IDYLLIC. IT’S UTOPIAN. IT’S REALLY THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS. … BUT IT WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE NEAR THE OCEAN. I CAN’T BE AWAY FROM THE BEACH.

YET— NOVEMBER 2019 – BY BOOTH MOORE “IT’S SMALLER THAN IT USED TO BE,” SAYS OWENS OF THE CITY THAT HELPED SHAPE HIS GRITTY, GLAM AESTHETIC. OR MAYBE IT’S JUST THAT HE’S BIGGER, RETURNING TO L.A. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE MOVED TO PARIS 16 YEARS AGO. “THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF ME THAT’S AVOIDED COMING BACK TO L.A. BECAUSE IT’S KIND OF LIKE LOOKING AT PICTURES OF YOURSELF WITH BAD BANGS OR SOMETHING, YOU REMEMBER AN UNFINISHED, NOT FULLY FORMED YOU,” SAYS RICK OWENS OF RETURNING AFTER 16 YEARS TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STARTED HIS LABEL IN 1994. “ALSO, I KNEW I WAS GOING TO GET SUCKED IN.” WHEN OWENS LEFT, LOS ANGELES STILL HAD A REPUTATION AS A SECOND CITY — IT WAS BEFORE HEDI SLIMANE, TOM FORD AND MARIA GRAZIA CHIURI ROLLED OUT THEIR RUNWAYS HERE, AND BEFORE THE CITY BECAME AS WELL-KNOWN FOR ART AND FOOD AS FOR ENTERTAINMENT. BACK THEN, OWENS WAS FRESH OUT OF SMALL TOWN PORTERVILLE, CALIF., A YOUNG, HARD-PARTYING FASHION UPSTART NEWLY IN LOVE WITH HIS FRENCH MUSE MICHÈLE LAMY. A DESIGNER IN HER OWN RIGHT, SHE ALSO RAN THE NINETIES HOLLYWOOD HOT SPOT LES DEUX CAFÉS, WHERE AL PACINO, NICOLE KIDMAN, DAVID LYNCH AND MANY MORE CAME TO DRINK AND DINE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS STILL SO ROUGH, LAMY HAD TO HAVE A SECURITY GUARD WALK HER ACROSS THE STREET TO THEIR APARTMENT AFTER CLOSING. “IT’S SMALLER THAN IT USED TO BE,” SAYS OWENS OF THE CITY THAT HELPED SHAPE HIS GRITTY, GLAM AESTHETIC. OR MAYBE IT’S JUST THAT HE’S BIGGER, BEING DRIVEN FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN A CHAUFFEURED BLACK VAN WITH MICHELE — OR HUN AS HE CALLS HER — AND THE YOUNG ENTOURAGE OF KIDS WHO WORK FOR THEM SEEING THEIR OLD AND NEW HAUNTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. “WE ARE STAYING AT THE CHATEAU, WHERE WE USED TO LIVE 20 YEARS AGO, WHEN IT WAS KIND OF RUNDOWN,” OWENS SAYS, RECALLING HOW THEY MOVED INTO THE HOTEL THE MOMENT THEY GOT HELD UP AT GUNPOINT IN THEIR LOS FELIZ HOME. THEY STAYED FOR A YEAR. “WE HAD THE CHEAPEST ROOM IN THE BACK OVER THE KITCHEN. THE ROOM WE HAVE NOW IS A COUPLE OF FLOORS ABOVE. WHEN WE ARRIVED, WALKING THROUGH THAT FAMILIAR CONFIGURATION, OPENING THE TERRACE AND GETTING THE SMELL OF THOSE PLANTS OVER THAT ALLEY, IT WAS AMAZING. YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES WHERE YOU GET A SUDDEN RUSH OF MEMORY, AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A ROMANTICIZED THING, BUT IT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE.” HE’S CERTAINLY BEEN MAKING THE MOST OF EVERY L.A. MINUTE, INCLUDING BLOWING OUT BIRTHDAY CANDLES WITH DEMI MOORE, JEREMY SCOTT AND GUCCI GHOST ON FRIDAY NIGHT AT A DINNER PARTY HOSTED BY COSTUME DESIGNER ARIANNE PHILLIPS (“HE IS THE NEW GOLD STANDARD,” PHILLIPS SAYS OF HIS SUCCESS WITHOUT THE BACKING OF A LUXURY CONGLOMERATE). HE PARTIED WITH SUSANNE BARTSCH AT THE CLUB IN IAN SCHRAGER’S NEW EDITION HOTEL SATURDAY NIGHT; HIT THE BROAD, THE HAMMER, HAUSER AND WIRTH, AND BACK AT THE BEACH FOR BREAKFAST FOR OLD TIME’S SAKE, AND TOOK WWD ON A DRIVE THROUGH HOLLYWOOD ON SUNDAY, BEFORE CAPPING IT ALL OFF WITH A SIGNING OF HIS NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND LARRY LEGASPI BOOKS AT HIS STORE ON MONDAY, HIS ACTUAL BIRTHDAY. HE’S TURNING 58, 18 YEARS SOBER, TANNED AND GYM-TONED AS EVER. AGE DOESN’T FAZE HIM. AFTER GOING TO WATCH THE DAREDEVILS AT THE SKATE PARK ON VENICE BEACH, HE’S THINKING HE MIGHT ACTUALLY TAKE IT UP, “BECAUSE I NEVER DID AND WHY NOT?” IT MAY BE A LONG TIME SINCE HE’S SET FOOT HERE, BUT OWENS’ LEGACY STILL RESONATES. “HE WAS A GUY WHO THOUGHT BIGGER THAN L.A. IT’S HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON ME,” SAYS MIKE AMIRI, WHO ONLY FELT LIKE HE’D ARRIVED AS A DESIGNER WHEN HIS PHOTO WAS PINNED NEXT TO OWENS’ ON THE WALL OF THE DOWNTOWN FABRIC STORE RAGFINDERS. OWENS LEFT IN 2003. AFTER SHOWING IN NEW YORK TWICE, HE WAS WORRIED HE WOULD END UP BEING “THE WEIRDO NICHE GUY” IN A SPORTSWEAR MARKET. HE FIGURED HE MIGHT AS WELL GIVE PARIS A TRY, AND BE CLOSER TO HIS NEW MANUFACTURING IN ITALY, WHERE HE SLEPT ON THE FACTORY FLOOR FOR A WHILE TO ADAPT TO THE WORKERS AND THE PACE. IT WASN’T NOSTALGIA, BUT AN INVITATION FROM THE LAND ARTIST MICHAEL HEIZER THAT PERSUADED HIM TO OVERCOME AN AVERSION TO LONG FLIGHTS AND COME BACK. AND AS SOON AS OWENS LANDED LAST TUESDAY, HE BOARDED A BLACK TOUR BUS WITH SLEEPING BUNKS BOUND FOR THE NEVADA DESERT TO VISIT HEIZER’S STILL-UNFINISHED, 47-YEARS-IN-THE-MAKING OPUS LAND SCULPTURE, “CITY,” WHICH WILL NO DOUBT INSPIRE A FUTURE RUNWAY COLLECTION. WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, OWENS, LAMY AND THEIR TEAM DECIDED THEY’D ALSO VENTURE TO FIND HEIZER’S “DOUBLE NEGATIVE.” EXCEPT THAT DIDN’T GO ACCORDING TO PLAN; THEY HAD TO CALL A HELICOPTER TO RESCUE THEM WHEN THEIR GPS FAILED AND THE ROAD “DISAPPEARED.” ”IT WAS EPIC,” HE SAYS OF WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A SCENE FROM A MAD MAX MOVIE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FUTURISTIC LOOKS YOU KNOW THEY WERE ALL ROCKING. LA BREA STORE “EPIC” IS ALSO WHAT THE DESIGNER SAYS, WALKING INTO HIS STORE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE IT OPENED FOUR YEARS AGO, ON A STRETCH OF LA BREA THAT STILL HAS A LOT OF GRIT. STRIDING ON 6-INCH PLATFORM BOOTS INTO THE 5,200-SQUARE-FOOT FORMER RIBBON FACTORY HE DESIGNED TO RIVAL A CECIL B. DEMILLE SET, OWENS MARVELS AT THE SOARING CEILINGS, THE JAMES TURRELL-LIKE OUTDOOR SKYLIGHT, AND THE DRESSING ROOM OTTOMAN SUPPORTED BY THE LEGS OF HIS OWN LIFE-SIZE WAX FIGURE. “LOOK HOW MUCH THICKER MY HAIR WAS THEN,” HE DEADPANS. WHEN THE FOG MACHINE IS TURNED ON AND A WALL-SIZED GLASS TANK STARTS FILLING WITH TENDRILS OF SMOKE, HE LETS OUT A CONTENT, “OHHH!!!,” BEFORE POKING FUN AT HIMSELF: “SHAMELESS THEATRICS.” OUTSIDE, HE WALKS PAST KIDS PICKING THROUGH PILES OF VINTAGE CLOTHING ON THE SIDEWALK AT JET RAG’S $1 SALE, AND SHAKES HANDS WITH A GUY WHO WANTS HIM TO COME INTO HIS COFFEE SHOP/SKATE ART GALLERY. “C’MON HUN, YOU CAN SIT NEXT TO ME,” HE SAYS, BOARDING THE VAN AND GIVING HIS IPHONE TO THE DRIVER TO PLAY PARTY TUNES. HEADING EAST ON SUNSET BOULEVARD, EN ROUTE TO THEIR FIRST STUDIO AT 1641 NORTH LAS PALMAS, OWENS AND LAMY START TALKING ABOUT THE EARLY DAYS — WHEN THEY LIVED IN HIS STUDIO ACROSS FROM LES DEUX CAFÉS, AND EVENTUALLY AT HER HOME IN LOS FELIZ, WITH HER DAUGHTER FROM HER FIRST MARRIAGE, SCARLETT ROUGE, WHO IS NOW AN ARTIST. “WHEN I WAS GOING TO OTIS PARSONS, I DIDN’T EXPLORE, CIRCULATE OR GO TO HOLLYWOOD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. I DIDN’T HAVE A LOT OF INITIATIVE OR IMAGINATION,” OWENS REMEMBERS. “THEN I MET MICHELE WHEN I WAS 25. AT FIRST I LIVED ON GRACE AVENUE IN THE WILCOX, THAT WAS CRACK CORNER, BUT I HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT THERE, A SPANISH COLONIAL ONE BEDROOM. IT WAS ALL VERY DARK AND I HUNG THE WALLS WITH BLACK-AND-GOLD MOIRE BROCADE I GOT DOWNTOWN FROM JOBBERS. BUT LOOKING BACK, IT WAS REALLY GOOD BROCADE.” THEN, THE TWO LET LOOSE ONE OF THE MORE MIND-BLOWING FACTOIDS OF THE DAY: LAMY’S DAUGHTER WENT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH MEGHAN MARKLE, WHO USED TO COME SWIM AT THEIR POOL — AND RIDE ON A GIANT BLACK DILDO. “BY THAT POINT, I HAD MOVED IN,” OWENS EXPLAINS. “WE REDECORATED THIS LOFT ROOM OVERLOOKING THE POOL. I HAD BOUGHT THIS BIG BLACK DILDO FOR MY DESK. AND SCARLETT, THOUGH SHE LOATHED ME, WOULD COME IN AND SAY, ‘CAN WE PLAY WITH YOUR BIG BLACK THING?’ SHE AND THE OTHER EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRLS WOULD JUMP IN THE POOL AND RIDE IT, AND MAYBE ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WAS MEGHAN MARKLE. THAT’S A SCOOP, MEGHAN MARKLE AND THE BIG BLACK DILDO!” 1641 LAS PALMAS THE VAN PULLS UP TO THE CURB ON LAS PALMAS, AND THE VAN CREW START CHEERING WHEN THEY SEE OWENS AND LAMY WALKING UP TO THE STOREFRONTS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN. “THIS WAS MY SHOWROOM, THAT WAS MY WORKROOM, AND ACROSS THE STREET, MICHELE WAS THERE, THOSE WERE THE DOORS TO THE BACK CABARET,” OWENS SAYS. “AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, SHE’D BE SINGING WHILE I WAS GOING TO SLEEP, AND I COULD HEAR HER.” THAT’S IF THEY WEREN’T HAVING FRIENDS OVER. “WE’D HAVE PEOPLE OVER FOR AFTER-DRINKS ON THE ROOF. THE EGYPTIAN [THEATRE] WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND SOMETIMES WE’D GO EXPLORING THE CONSTRUCTION SITE. THEY WERE REDOING THE WHOLE THING SO YOU COULD GO IN AND SEE THE 1920S ORIGINAL PAINTING WHEN IT WAS KIND OF COLLAPSING. IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL,” HE SAYS, HINTING AT THE ORIGINS OF HIS GRANDIOSE-DECREPIT STYLE. “HUN, LET’S GO LOOK IN THE ALLEY,” HE MOTIONS TO LAMY. “OUR MORNING GLORIES ARE STILL HERE. WE PLANTED THOSE,” HE SAYS. “AND OUR BACKDOOR STILL HAS THE ANARCHY SIGN ON IT.” LES DEUX CAFES (LIAISON) ACROSS THE STREET, LAMY PRESIDED OVER THE COOLEST CLUB IN TOWN IN THE NINETIES, WITH A PROVENCAL-STYLE OUTDOOR GARDEN RESTAURANT SERVING FRENCH FARE, AND AN INDOOR CABARET. “I HAVE A MEDAL FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOR REINVIGORATING HOLLYWOOD,” SHE SAYS. WHAT’S LEFT IS JUST A FAÇADE AND A PRIVATE EVENTS SPACE, GEARING UP FOR WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WEDDING PARTY, WITH A MANAGER WHO IS NOT FEELING PARTICULARLY GENEROUS ABOUT HAVING GOTH FORMER OWNERS TAKE A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE. THEY WALK ANYWAY, LOOKING AT WHAT’S NOW ALMOST AN ENTIRELY INDOOR SPACE WITHOUT ONE IOTA OF CHARM. ONLY THE BATHROOMS ARE THE SAME. “YOU CANNOT BE INSIDE, WE AREN’T EVEN OPEN YET. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE,” THE GUY BEHIND THE BAR SAYS. “IT’S HORRIBLE,” LAMY SAYS, SHAKING HER HEAD. AS THE VAN TURNS ONTO HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, MORE MEMORIES FLOOD BACK. “MICHELE HAD A LITTLE SANDWICH SHOP CALLED THE RITZ OVER THERE WHERE SCARLETT MADE BIO SANDWICHES,” OWENS REMEMBERS. “IT WAS THE WRONG CROWD BUT A VALIANT ATTEMPT. I WAS THE MAIN CUSTOMER AND I HAD A DISCOUNT.” HOLLYHOCK HOUSEz IF OWENS LACKED CURIOSITY ABOUT L.A. WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER, HE’S MAKING UP FOR IT NOW. “I NEVER REALLY STUDIED FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT WHEN I LIVED HERE, BUT AFTER WE MOVED, I COULDN’T BELIEVE I’D NEVER BEEN TO THE HOLLYHOCK HOUSE,” HE SAYS, DIRECTING THE DRIVER EAST TO BARNSDALL ART PARK, WHERE THE HOUSE BUILT FOR OIL HEIRESS ALINE BARNSDALL IN 1919 IS A UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE PERCHED ON A 36-ACRE HILLTOP. WITH ITS MAYAN REVIVAL STYLE, AZTEC, ASIAN AND EGYPTIAN DESIGN TOUCHES, IT’S EASY TO SEE THE APPEAL FOR OWENS, WHO TAKES A SEAT ON A BENCH OUTSIDE TO SLIP SHOE COVERS OVER HIS GINORMOUS PLATFORM BOOTS BEFORE THE HOUSE TOUR. “I’M NOT GIVING THEM BACK,” HE SAYS, SMITTEN BY THE WHITE CLOTH SHOOTIES. BEFORE HE’S EVEN CROSSED THE THRESHOLD, HE’S ALREADY LET OUT ANOTHER “OHHHHH…” OF DELIGHT, JUST SEEING THE ARCHITECT’S TEXTILE BLOCK MOTIF ON HARDWARE. INSIDE, OWENS, WHOSE OWN FURNITURE BUSINESS IS BOOMING, INSPECTS THE DINING TABLE WITH HIGH-BACK CHAIRS, GEOMETRIC LIVING ROOM SEATING AND THE FIREPLACE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED WITH A WATER MOAT AROUND IT. A FELLOW HOUSE VISITOR IS ONTO OWENS. “THESE ARE YOURS,” HE SAYS, SHOWING OFF HIS DRKSHDW SNEAKERS. “WHERE DID YOU BUY THOSE? AND WHAT DO THEY SAY ON THE BACK?” THE DESIGNER ASKS, SEEMING GENUINELY INTERESTED. “I’M PRAYING TO THE ALIENS. THAT’S RIGHT, THAT’S FROM AN OLD GARY NUMAN SONG, ONE OF MY FAVORITES WHEN I WAS A KID.” THE TOUR GUIDE IS ONTO HIM, TOO, AND OFFERS THE GROUP A PRIVATE TOUR OF ROOMS NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, INCLUDING THE MASTER BEDROOM, ANOTHER “OOOH” WITH HIGHER CEILINGS THAN THE REST OF THE HOUSE, AND A GEOMETRIC STAINED GLASS SUNROOM. OWENS SEEMS JUST AS TAKEN WITH THE OFFBEAT STORY OF THE HOUSE’S OWNER, BARNSDALL, A SINGLE MOTHER WITH A DAUGHTER NAMED “SUGAR TOP,” WHO FIRED THE FAMED ARCHITECT WHEN HE FAILED TO BUILD HER THE BOHEMIAN ARTISTS’ COMPOUND SHE WANTED. HE ASKS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF WRIGHT’S MAYAN REVIVAL STYLE, AND THE TOUR GUIDE OFFERS INFO ABOUT A MAYAN EXHIBITION HELD IN SAN DIEGO IN THE 1910S AS THE POSSIBLE SOURCE. “HE THOUGHT THIS WAS MORE INDIGENOUS TO CALIFORNIA THAN WHAT HE CALLED TAWDRY SPANISH COLONIAL.” “TAWDRY, THAT’S A WORD WE DON’T USE OFTEN ENOUGH,” SAYS OWENS. BEFORE LEAVING, HE TAKES A SELFIE AND SIGNS A BOOK FOR THE TOUR GUIDE’S SON, WHO IS A RAPPER IN BEIRUT. “WHAT’S NOT TO LOVE?” OWENS SAYS OF THE HOUSE. “MAYBE DOUBLE THE PROPORTION…IT WOULD BE EPIC IF IT WAS HIGHER.” SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD BACK IN THE VAN, WE’RE CRUISING WEST ON SANTA MONICA: “I’M ENJOYING REMEMBERING WHERE I BOUGHT CRACK,” OWENS SAYS, LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT THE SKETCHY BLOCKS EAST OF VINE. (NOT SURE IF HE’S KIDDING.) “DO YOU REMEMBER PORTS? IT WAS A LITTLE TINY BAR, IT HAD A RESTAURANT, AND A WOMAN NAMED MICAELA WHO USED TO RUN IT.…MARTINIS AT PORTS, LOTS OF MARTINIS AT PORTS.” CROSSING CAHUENGA: “I USED TO WORK OUT A LOT AT GOLD’S, I’D WEAR LEATHER JEANS WITH BIKER BOOTS WITH ARMY SURPLUS SHORTS OVER THE LEATHER PANTS AND SWEATSHIRTS.” SO YOU WOULD SWEAT MORE? “NO, I WAS WORKING A LOOK. I DON’T SWEAT.” THE KIDS IN THE BACK, INCLUDING THE STORE MANAGER AND THE OWENSCORP P.R., ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE BOOK SIGNING. THERE WAS A LINE AROUND THE BLOCK IN NEW YORK. L.A. WILL BE BIGGER, THEY THINK. OWENS HAS BEEN ASKED TO SIGN EVERYTHING, WELL, ALMOST EVERYTHING. “I’VE NEVER DONE A P NIS YET, I HOPE IT’S L.A.” HE SAYS. “MY FAVORITE, THOUGH, IS I GET THIS PATERNAL RUSH WHEN GUYS HAVE THE LABEL TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF THEIR NECK.” TO HIS RIGHT, PULLING INTO TRAFFIC, IS A BURGUNDY CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE WITH A PAIR OF CRYSTAL STUDDED GUITARS IN THE BACK. THE KIDS HAVE THEIR HEADS IN THEIR PHONES AND DON’T NOTICE. “HE IS TAKING HIS GUITARS OUT FOR A DRIVE. HE IS SUNNING THEM,” OWENS LAUGHS. HE AND HUN WANT TO GO TO THE GETTY MUSEUM, BUT AREN’T SURE THEY’LL HAVE TIME BEFORE DINNER AT ARTIST THOMAS HOUSEAGO’S STUDIO IN FROGTOWN. THEN THERE’S KANYE’S SUNDAY SERVICE NEXT WEEKEND. LAMY IS A REGULAR, AND SHE WANTS OWENS TO STAY FOR IT. HE CAN’T, BUT HE’LL BE BACK, MAYBE EVEN FOR HIS OWN RUNWAY SHOW ONE DAY. “IT WOULD BE A REALLY FUN THING TO DO AND I’M SURE AT SOME POINT I WILL,” HE SAYS. “MAYBE FOR MY 60TH, WHICH IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.“ Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

HIS CLOTHES (LIKE HIS MAD MAX LEATHER JACKETS AND CLOMPING MEGASNEAKERS) AND HIS STORES (LIKE THE ONE IN PARIS THAT FAMOUSLY FEATURES A SCULPTURE OF THE MAN HIMSELF URINATING) HAVE ALWAYS INSISTED ON IT; IT’S THE WORLD THAT HAS CAUGHT UP. NOW, AT 57, THE DESIGNER HAS A STRONG CLAIM TO BE ONE OF FASHION’S ÉMINENCES GRISES, BOTTLE-BLACK LOCKS NOTWITHSTANDING. BUT AS A RARE INDEPENDENT IN AN EVER MORE CORPORATIZED FASHION WORLD, OWENS IS FAR FROM GOING GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT: AFTER WINNING THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA’S LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD IN 2017, HE WAS NAMED ITS MENSWEAR DESIGNER OF THE YEAR IN 2019. FOR THE CUT’S NEW INTERVIEW SERIES WITH FASHION’S MOST FORMATIVE VOICES, OWENS SPOKE ABOUT AGING, PLEASURE, AND THE RADICAL POWER OF ’70S SHOCK ROCK. AM I CATCHING YOU AT A GOOD TIME? I JUST GOT UP. WE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF YES IN BROOKLYN. HAVE YOU BEEN THERE? IT WAS REALLY CUTE. IT WAS A VOGUING BALL. YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW SUCCESSFUL FASHION DESIGNERS TO HAVE REMAINED INDEPENDENT ALL THESE YEARS. YOU’RE JUST ABOUT THE ONLY ONE. I DON’T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED — ACTUALLY, I DO KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED. I HAD FANTASTIC PARTNERS WHO ALLOWED ME TO DEVELOP MY VOICE LONGER THAN THE THREE SEASONS THEY USUALLY GIVE DESIGNERS. I ALWAYS JOKE WITH THEM THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITH ANYBODY. BEING ABLE TO GET STUFF — I DON’T MEAN TO BE CRASS — AT THE RIGHT PRICE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, THAT’S THE TRICK. IT’S NOT THE CONCEPT SO MUCH, THOUGH THAT HELPS. GETTING IT EXECUTED IS WHAT IT’S ALL ABOUT. IT DOESN’T SOUND THAT POETIC, BUT IT CAN BE. BUT THE CYCLE JUST GOES FASTER AND FASTER, AND PEOPLE WANT MORE AND MORE. I HAVE ONLY FOUR COLLECTIONS A YEAR, FOUR RUNWAYS ON WHICH I’M JUDGED. I HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF THE SPEED THAN GUYS THAT WORK AT THOSE HOUSES DO. I DON’T HAVE IT THAT HARD AT ALL. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PRESSURE, BUT WHAT ELSE WOULD I BE DOING WITH MY LIFE? IT KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES. AND STIMULATED. AND IT GIVES THIS BRAND A SENSE OF PURPOSE, WHICH EVERYBODY COULD USE. MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE RECONSIDERING IF RUNWAY SHOWS ARE THE BEST WAY TO SHOW FASHION AT THE MOMENT. ARE YOU COMMITTED TO THEM? ABSOLUTELY. THEY WERE THE LAST THING I EVER DREAMED OF WHEN I STARTED DOING CLOTHES. I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED COMING OUT FOR A BOW AT THE END OF A RUNWAY SHOW, WHICH IS THE MOTIVATION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY START THINKING OF BEING A DESIGNER. IT TOOK ME A MINUTE TO FIND MY VOICE, TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REGISTER ME AND DECIDE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TOLERATE SOMEBODY THAT MADE SLOW MOVEMENTS. WHEN I STARTED OUT, THE MOVEMENTS WERE A LOT SLOWER, AND NOW THE GESTURES ARE A LOT GRANDER AND A LOT MORE DRAMATIC, BUT I DIDN’T REALLY REALIZE THAT I WAS GOING TO ENJOY IT THAT MUCH, THE THEATER OF IT. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS OTHER THAN JUST CLOTHES. THAT’S A GIFT, BEING ABLE TO HAVE A PLATFORM TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEAUTY IN A MORE BEHAVIORAL-SOCIAL WAY. YOU’VE HELPED CHANGE THE WAY WE SEE BEAUTY. I THINK IT’S JUST A PRIMAL THING. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO WANT CEREMONIES; THEY’RE ALWAYS GOING TO GATHER TOGETHER TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING MOVING AS A COMMUNITY. IT’S DRUID CEREMONIES, IT’S CHURCH, IT’S VOGUING BALLS. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A SENSE OF RISK, THAT SENSE OF COMPETITION, AND THAT’S WHAT RUNWAY SHOWS CAN BE. IT’S SEEING SOMEBODY TAKE A RISK AND MAKE A LEAP. WE WILL FOREVER BE LOOKING FOR THAT THRILL. ESPECIALLY NOW, WITH INSTAGRAM, RUNWAY SHOWS ARE MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER. PEOPLE CAN COMMUNICATE ABOUT THEM IN A MORE SPEEDY WAY THAN THEY COULD BEFORE. I WAS GOING TO SAY THE RIGHT VOICES ARE GOING TO END UP BEING HEARD, BUT WE’VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED. THE LOUDEST VOICES ARE THE ONES THAT GET HEARD. BUT I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S GOING TO LAST FOREVER. THE LOUDEST OFTEN WINS. WHAT’S INTERESTING NOW IS THAT WHOLE BOURGEOIS THING, WHICH RICCARDO TISCI STARTED DOING AT BURBERRY AND HEDI SLIMANE IS DOING AT CELINE. THERE’S A BIG CELINE BILLBOARD IN PLACE DE LA CONCORDE THAT I PASS EVERY DAY. A PLEATED TWEED CULOTTE SKIRT AND A PETER PAN COLLAR TRIMMED IN LACE, PEARLS OR SOMETHING — IT’S THIS HUGE BILLBOARD. I KNOW THAT IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE PROVOCATIVE, AND IT IS, BECAUSE IT KIND OF STUNS ME EVERY TIME I SEE IT. THAT THIS SENSIBILITY IS ASPIRATIONAL FOR A YOUNG AUDIENCE THAT NEVER REALLY EXPERIENCED THAT, I SUPPOSE? ALL OF THEIR PARENTS ARE WEARING MY CLOTHES! I CAN SEE HOW THAT GENERATION IS REACTING AGAINST ME. I TAKE IT VERY PERSONALLY. WITH A GIGGLE. I DO APPRECIATE THAT THERE’S A SUBTLETY TO IT, THAT IT’S A REACTION TO THE FLASH THAT WE’VE BEEN SEEING FOR A WHILE. I WAS JUST TELLING SOMEBODY THAT I DON’T REALLY GO TO SHOWS WHEN I COME TO NEW YORK, BUT THE ONES THAT I WOULD HAVE GONE TO, I WOULD HAVE GONE TO SEE THE ROW. THEY’VE REALLY MAINTAINED A CONSISTENTLY PURE AESTHETIC THAT I’M ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK AT. IT’S THE ANTITHESIS OF ALL THE OTHER RUNWAY SHOWS IN NEW YORK. I ADMIRE WHAT THEY’RE DOING. THERE’S THAT OTHER BRAND, CDLM; I LIKED WHAT I SAW THAT THEY WERE DOING. BUT I’M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS. THOSE WERE THE ONES THAT I REALLY TOOK NOTE OF, BUT I’M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS. YOU’RE SO ENGAGED! OH, SURE, I’M A FASHION FAN. I LIKE TO SEE WHAT’S HAPPENING AROUND. I’M NOT A SNOB — WELL, I AM A SNOB, I GUESS. LET’S TALK ABOUT LARRY LEGASPI, THE ’70S COSTUME DESIGNER WHO WORKED WITH KISS AND LABELLE. YOU CHANNELED HIM FOR A 2019 COLLECTION AND WROTE A BOOK ABOUT HIS WORK. WHY HIM? WHEN I STARTED THAT BOOK, I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY EXPLAINING HOW MY AESTHETIC DEVELOPED — THROUGH HIM, IN A WAY. WHEN I WAS 13 AND KISS EXPLODED, IT WAS KIND OF UNPRECEDENTED. THERE HAD BEEN THE NEW YORK DOLLS AND GLITTER ROCK, BUT THIS ONE WAS SO BOMBASTIC AND WITH SUCH FULL-ON TESTOSTERONE, WITH THE VOMITING OF BLOOD AND THE PYROTECHNICS AND FOG AND THE VITALITY OF THESE MEN IN THESE HEELS AND BLACK. AND THEN IT WAS VERY MUCH MORE BLACK LEATHER. LATER ON, IT BECAME BLACK SPANDEX. BUT THEN IT WAS MORE SINISTER AND MORE DEPRAVED AND MORE MENACING — AUTHENTICALLY MENACING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS A 13-YEAR-OLD. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPRESS, AND IT DID. THERE WAS A MELANCHOLY SIDE OF THIS TOO; IT’S A LOST GENERATION. IT EXPRESSED THIS UTOPIAN, IDYLLIC, INNOCENT WORLD — AND THE THRILL IS THAT THIS KIND OF CAMP SENSIBILITY BECAME PART OF THE BLACK SOUL CULTURE IN AMERICA AND THEN BECAME PART OF STADIUM ROCK, MIDDLE-AMERICAN CULTURE. THIS CAMP SENSIBILITY FROM A GAY MAN [LEGASPI] BECAME A HUGE INFLUENCE. THAT’S MY DNA. THAT GENDER FLUIDITY BUT WITH A VITALITY. SWAGGER. THAT PRIMAL MALE SWAGGER MIXED WITH MAKEUP AND HEELS. AND WITH MENACE. WITH AGGRESSION. THAT RECIPE IS KIND OF MY PERCEPTION OF MASCULINITY IN A WAY, MY PERSONAL PERCEPTION. THIS WAS YOUR PRIMAL SCENE. AND KNOWING THAT THERE WAS SOME PLACE TO GO AND BE THAT — THAT IT WAS A POSSIBILITY. THAT HADN’T OCCURRED TO ME. THAT I COULD BE THIS GUY SPEWING BLOOD IN MAKEUP AND HEELS DOING A GUITAR SOLO. IN FOG. THAT’S WHO I WANTED TO BE. VOMITING BLOOD? YES! AND LAYING WASTE. DO YOU THINK YOU’VE ACHIEVED THAT? TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, I SUPPOSE I HAVE! I’VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY HONEST ABOUT IT ALL BEING SELF-INVENTION, AND IF I CAN DO IT, ANYBODY CAN DO IT. IT’S ALL ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHO YOU ARE. THAT’S SOMETHING I’VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SAY THROUGH CLOTHES, TOO. FIGURING OUT WHAT’S WRONG WITH YOU AND LETTING IT GO AND WORKING ON IT BUT NOT KILLING YOURSELF OVER IT. JUST WORKING WITH WHAT YOU’VE GOT. I’M VERY HONEST ABOUT IT ALL BEING COMPLETE ARTIFICE, BUT THAT’S FINE. THAT’S ALL IT NEEDS TO BE. THAT SENSIBILITY IN YOUR WORK SEEMED TO EMERGE FULLY FORMED — THAT DARK AESTHETIC, THE SCARY POWER OF IT. I DON’T KNOW. I WAS A PRETTY FEY KID, PRETTY FRAGILE. IT WAS A PRETTY LONG ROAD; IT TOOK A LONG TIME. THERE’S DEFINITELY A LOT OF FRAGILITY THERE SOMETIMES. IT’S STILL VERY MUCH A WORK-IN-PROGRESS — AS WE ALL ARE. IN RECENT COLLECTIONS, YOUR PIECES HAVE SEEMED AS MUCH ARCHITECTURE AS FASHION. WHEN I STARTED, IT WAS A VERY LANGUID, DRIPPY SILHOUETTE. AS I LEARNED HOW TO EXECUTE THINGS MORE PRECISELY, IT STARTED ENGORGING. IT STARTED GETTING STIFFER AND MORE SCULPTURAL. YOU CAN SEE THIS ARC OF SOMEBODY LEARNING HOW TO HAVE SOME FUN. AT THE PEAK OF YOUR LIFE, I SUPPOSE IN THEORY, THE IDEAL SCENARIO IS YOU GRADUALLY REACH SOME KIND OF LEVEL OF SERENITY AND SELF-AWARENESS. AND MY SERENITY … MY FATHER WAS SO INTERESTED IN SELF-AWARENESS AND LEARNING. AS HE GOT OLDER, THOUGH, HE JUST BECAME MORE FRUSTRATED AND MORE BITTER AND THE OPPOSITE OF SERENE. I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S BECAUSE PHYSICALLY THERE’S A DETERIORATION THAT MAKES YOU FEARFUL AND REACTIONARY AND IF THAT’S INEVITABLE. BUT I’VE ALSO SEEN OLDER PEOPLE WHO GET TO A PLACE OF PEACE THAT I ADMIRE. MAYBE BY THAT TIME, I’LL JUST HAVE GRANDKIDS AND KITTENS. YOUR WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, IS A MUSE AND YOUR COLLABORATOR. HOW DOES YOUR RELATIONSHIP WORK? MICHÈLE IS ALMOST ALL ID. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I’M JUST NOT READY FOR HER AND I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF TO OPEN UP TO HER IN A DIFFERENT WAY. A LOT OF MY LIFE IS JUST THINKING LOGICALLY HOW TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B IN THE STRAIGHTEST LINE. IF I’M IN THAT KIND OF MOOD, I HAVE TO CHANGE MY BRAIN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH MICHÈLE. SHE IS GOING TO GET COMPLETELY ABSTRACT. SHE IS PURE POETRY. SOMETIMES I JUST HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF, GET OUT OF YOUR UPTIGHTNESS AND LISTEN TO THIS, GET INTO THIS MOOD. THIS MOOD IS ESSENTIAL. SHE REMINDS ME TO NOT BE SO RIGID. SHE PUSHES ME AROUND IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT SOMEHOW I HAD THE GOOD SENSE ENOUGH TO SEE I NEEDED TO HAVE TO NORMALIZE ME. IT’S HARD TO QUANTIFY WHAT INFLUENCE SHE HAS, BUT I TRUST HER. AND SOMEWHERE DEEPLY I KNOW IT GIVES ME SOME KIND OF SENSE OF BALANCE. OTHERWISE, I WOULD JUST GET TOO UPTIGHT. I’VE GOT TO ASK: HOW DO I GET THE RICK OWENS BODY? I WORK OUT ALMOST EVERY DAY. AND YOU DO HAVE TO DO SIT-UPS, AT LEAST 100 SIT-UPS A DAY. YOU JUST HAVE TO. IT’S LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH. IT BECOMES SOMETHING YOU DO. IT’S JUST VANITY. IT’S NOT THAT MUCH ABOUT HEALTH. THAT’S WHAT I DO. WHAT I DO IS ALL ABOUT AESTHETICS, SO I’M GOING TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE EVERYTHING AROUND ME LOOK AS GOOD AS IT CAN. I’VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 20 YEARS. BUT I’M SOMEBODY WHO LOVES ROUTINE, SO FOR ME, REPETITION IS THERAPEUTIC AND FUN. BUT I’M REALLY, REALLY LUCKY. I SMOKE A LOT AND I EAT CAKE.

A POET CAN BE MORE DAMAGED AND SOFT, BUT AN ARTIST HAS TO BE A HERO.” SO ‘POET’ HE’S HAPPY WITH, ‘ARTIST’ NOT SO MUCH. HE FEELS HEROISM DEMANDS A GRANDNESS – BIGGER URGES, BIGGER APPETITES – THAT HE CAN’T MATCH. IRONIC, THEN, THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT OWENS IS GRAND. IMMENSE EVEN. HIS SHOWS IN THE PLAZA OF THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN PARIS EVOKE PAGAN RITUALS, WITH CLOTHES OF PRIMAL MAJESTY. THE FURNITURE HE DESIGNS HAS THE BRUTALIST HEFT OF ANCIENT BABYLON. HIS APARTMENT IN VENICE, “STONE AND SUPER-DONE”, IS ON THE TOP FLOOR OF A CONDOMINIUM BUILDING ON THE LIDO, NEXT DOOR TO THE EXCELSIOR, WHERE ERROL FLYNN AND JOAN CRAWFORD FROLICKED. NEARBY IS THE HOTEL DES BAINS, WHERE DIAGHILEV DIED AND NIJINSKY DANCED ON THE SAND. SUCH DETAILS MATTER TO OWENS. EXTRAVAGANT CONTEXT IS A GIVEN WITH HIM. HIS HOUSE IN PARIS WAS ONCE THE OFFICE OF FORMER FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANÇOIS MITTERRAND. IT SHARES A SQUARE WITH THE PALAIS BOURBON, ORIGINALLY BUILT FOR LOUIS XIV’S DAUGHTER LOUISE, GUSSIED UP BY NAPOLEON, AND NOW HOME TO THE FRENCH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE IS THE SOCIETY FLORIST MOULIÉ, ITS WARES SPRAWLING LIKE A LAVISH GARDEN ACROSS A CITY BLOCK. AND NOW I’M SEEKING OWENS, THE FERAL WARRIOR KING HIMSELF. THROUGH THE VAST, SHADOWY INTERIOR OF HIS HOME I GO, AND OUT ONTO A SUN-BLASTED TERRACE WHERE HE’S SITTING UNDER A BOWER OF JASMINE PLANTED BY HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY. HORTENSE THE BENGAL CAT SPRAWLS NEARBY, FIERCELY EXOTIC BEAUTY IN PUREST FELINE FORM. OWENS’ PERMA-TANNED, HAWKISH FEATURES ARE OFFSET BY AN INCONGRUOUSLY LARGE PAIR OF WRAPAROUND READING GLASSES, THROUGH WHICH HE PEERS AT A LAPTOP. HE&#39;S ENTHUSING ABOUT PICASSO AND WAR, THE SUMMER EXHIBITION AT PARIS’ MUSÉE DE L’ARMÉE. “YOU SEE HOW HE HAD CLASSICAL TRAINING AND THEN IT ALL BECAME ABOUT REDUCING, REDUCING, REDUCING TO THE SIMPLEST, MOST POWERFUL, REDUCTIVIST STATEMENT.” SOUND FAMILIAR? OWENS CALLS UP A PICASSO PAINTING ON HIS SCREEN, WOMAN SMILING. I’VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE, AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND IT SINCE, BUT IT HAS THE MESMERISING STARKNESS OF HIS OWN WORK. HE SHOWS ME ANOTHER IMAGE, A LITTLE READYMADE, A BIT LIKE A JZUZHED-UP TOILET ROLL. THE READYMADE, THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF THE BANAL (MARCEL DUCHAMP’S URINAL!) – “THAT KIND OF STUFF MAKES ME GO THERE,” OWENS SAYS, POINTING AT HIS SHOELACES, NO LONGER BANAL SHOELACES, NOW TRANSMOGRIFIED INTO THICK, BLACK, WAX-COATED WORMS CRAWLING ACROSS THE TOP OF HIS TRAINERS. THEY’LL BE A MAJOR FEATURE OF HIS MEN’S SHOW A FEW WEEKS LATER. “I THINK OF PICASSO A LOT,” OWENS CONTINUES. “I ENJOY LOOKING AT IT SO MUCH – THE ART, THE MYTHOLOGY, THE ASSHOLE-NESS. WHENEVER I’M BEING A REAL D CK, I THINK OF PICASSO AND, WELL, I’M NOT THAT BAD. THE ICON OF THE MACHO, HEROIC LONER, THE ARTIST WHO MOWS PEOPLE DOWN AND USES AND USES AND USES... RIGHT NOW, I’M ENJOYING THE RAPTURE OF IT ALL. LATER, I’LL REVEL IN THE CORRUPTION OF IT ALL.” ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST FRANCE HAS JUST DONE A STORY ON OWENS’ VENETIAN BOLTHOLE. HE POSED FOR THE ACCOMPANYING PORTRAIT WITH HIS SHIRT OFF. “I WANT TO BE THE IGGY POP OF FASHION, I WANT TO BE THE SHIRTLESS GUY ALL THE TIME,” HE DRAWLS LANGUIDLY (THE LANGUID DRAWL IS AN OWENS SIGNATURE – IT ALLOWS HIM TO SAY OUTRAGEOUS THINGS IN A DECEPTIVELY MILD MANNER). “IT’S A GOOD TORSO, AND I’M NOT GOING TO HAVE IT FOREVER SO I WANT TO RECORD IT. MY BODY IS LEANER THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO. I HAVEN’T CHANGED MY DIET, I EAT JUST AS SLUTTY. I THINK IT’S JUST AN AGE THING.” I PICTURE HIM AS SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO ACQUIRE AN APPETITE FOR THE VERY FINEST THINGS IN LIFE (EVERYTHING BUT ALCOHOL, WHICH NEVER WORKED FOR HIM). YES, THAT’S TRUE, HE CONCEDES, BUT HE STILL LIKES THE SLUTTY STUFF. WHICH IS WHY, EVERY TIME HE LANDS AT CHARLES DE GAULLE, HE GOES STRAIGHT TO MARKS &amp; SPENCER AND BUYS TWO BOXES OF CUPCAKES. “WHEN I’M TASTING THOSE, I’M TASTING HOSTESS HO HOS.” LIKE MARCEL PROUST AND HIS MADELEINES, ONE BITE AND HE’S TRANSPORTED TO THE PAST, TO PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, WHERE RICHARD SATURNINO OWENS WAS BORN 57 YEARS AGO. “BLAME IT ON CECIL B DEMILLE AND OPERA,” OWENS SAYS OF THE IMMENSENESS OF HIS WORK. “GRAND EMOTIONS, HIGH PEAKS.” I SAY BLAME IT ON PORTERVILLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT HIS FATHER, JOHN, CREATED. THERE WAS WAGNER IN THE BASEMENT, STRAUSS UPSTAIRS IN THE MUSIC ROOM. “WE DIDN’T HAVE TV, BUT DAD HAD A LOT OF BOOKS ON SILENT MOVIES. I WAS FIXATED ON THEDA BARA. AND GLORIA SWANSON IN THAT MOVIE FOR CECIL B DEMILLE WHERE SHE WAS FILMED WITH A HEAVILY SEDATED LION. DEMILLE’S EPICS, WITH ALL THAT IMAGERY CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF MORALITY AND EXOTICISM, SHOWED YOU ALL THE TRANSGRESSIONS YOU HAD TO GET THROUGH TO REDEMPTION. THE MONOCHROME EPIC, THE THIRTIES ART DECO FILTER, THE LURID IMAGERY, THE MORAL ENDING... EVERYTHING I DO IS THAT.” OWENS NOW DESCRIBES HIS UPBRINGING AS VERY PURE AND FOCUSED. “BUT IT WAS AN ORDEAL AT THE TIME. WHY COULDN’T WE HAVE A TV SO I COULD WATCH THE MUNSTERS? I HAD TO WATCH IT AT A FRIEND’S HOUSE, THOUGH I THINK I LIKED THE ADDAMS FAMILY BETTER.” OWENS DIGRESSES FOR A MOMENT. “DO YOU REMEMBER HOGAN’S HEROES? A SITCOM SET IN A GERMAN PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP?” HE LETS THAT NOTION DANGLE IN THE AIR BETWEEN US, NO COMMENT NECESSARY ON THE POLARITIES THAT PROVIDE POP CULTURE WITH ITS PERVERSE BUT PREDICTABLE ACTION/REACTION MOMENTUM. POLARITIES WERE 16-YEAR-OLD OWENS’ LIFE: AT HOME, LISTENING TO WAGNER AND READING HIS FATHER’S COPY OF JORIS-KARL HUYSMANS’ AGAINST NATURE, THE ORIGIN STORY OF 19TH-CENTURY DECADENCE; OUTSIDE, SMOKING POT AND LISTENING TO LED ZEPPELIN WITH HIS FRIENDS, OR HANGING OUT WITH THE LESBIAN COUPLE IN THE NEARBY TRAILER PARK (THEY WERE THE ONLY GAY PEOPLE HE COULD FIND). AND HE OBSESSIVELY COLLECTED ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST AND GQ – FOR THE ANTONIO LOPEZ ILLUSTRATIONS, THE BRUCE WEBER SHOOTS. HIS MOTHER, CONNIE, STILL HAS THEM ALL. “I’M NOT REALLY SURE I HAD ANY SENSE THAT THOSE MAGAZINES WOULD EVER BE MY WORLD. I DO REMEMBER FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION AND HOPELESSNESS. BUT I WAS ALSO IMPATIENT, SO THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS INEVITABLE.” DO THEY CALL THAT MANIFEST DESTINY? ONE THING IS CLEAR: IN PORTERVILLE, OWENS ALREADY KNEW HOW TO INSULATE HIMSELF USING A BUBBLE OF HIS OWN DESIGN. BUT HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO WANDER. THERE’S OFTEN BEEN A NOMADIC ESSENCE IN HIS DESIGNS. IN 2003, OWENS TOOK HIMSELF FROM HIS BIRTHPLACE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC, TO A CITY WHERE HE DIDN’T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE (AND STILL DOESN’T). DID HE DELIBERATELY MAKE HIMSELF ROOTLESS? “YOU CAN’T ESCAPE WHO YOU FUNDAMENTALLY ARE. I FEEL I DID THE BEST WITH WHAT I HAD, AND ADJUSTED WHAT I NEEDED TO. IT’S VERY DIFFERENT FROM TRYING TO BE SOMEONE WHO YOU ARE NOT. I WANTED TO BE HALSTON, FOR INSTANCE, AND BE MORE EFFERVESCENT AND EMBRACE SUPERFICIALITY MORE. BUT IT WAS AN EFFERVESCENCE THAT WOULD NEVER BE PART OF MY WORLD AND A SUPERFICIALITY I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. I PROBABLY STILL WANT IT SOMETIMES. WHEN I GO TO A PARTY, I THINK, ‘OH, HALSTON WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE WITH HIS HALSTONETTES. I’M NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH.’” BUT I POINT OUT TO HIM THAT HE DOES HAVE HIS OWN HALSTONETTES – THE WONDERFUL CHRISTEENE AND THE DIVINE DAVID AND KEMBRA PFAHLER, AND THE REST OF THE COTERIE THAT SURROUNDS HIM, ALL OF THEM PUSHING “FAR ENOUGH” BEYOND ANY ENVELOPE YOU CAN IMAGINE – AND OH HOW HE LAUGHS, LONG AND HARD. IT WASN’T HALSTON, IT WAS CHARLES JAMES, THE OTHER GENIUS MANQUÉ OF AMERICAN FASHION, WHO WAS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH OWENS’ OWN VISION. HE SPEAKS FREELY OF HIS MESSY YEARS IN LA IN THE EIGHTIES, WHEN HE GOT UP TO EVERYTHING THAT YOU IMAGINE ANYONE WHO LOOKS LIKE OWENS WOULD GET UP TO IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF TOTAL LICENCE THAT LA IN THE EIGHTIES PROMISED – “THE MESSIEST I EVER GOT WAS WHEN I WAS THINKING I COULD BE CHARLES JAMES.” ALTHOUGH HE ADMITS HALSTON STILL HAD A PLACE IN HIS HEART. “WHEN HALSTON AND CALVIN KLEIN WERE AT THEIR PEAK, THEY WERE REALLY DOING SOMETHING PRETTY SPECIAL. IT WAS REDUCTIVE, AND A GRAND GESTURE IN THE SIMPLEST WAY THAT WAS VERY POWERFUL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT CHARLES JAMES, THOSE DRESSES ARE SUBLIME BUT THEY’RE REALLY PRETTY RIDICULOUS. THEY’RE SCULPTURES, BUT AS CLOTHES THEY’RE NOT WOMAN-FRIENDLY. THEY’RE OVERWROUGHT. THOUGH I’M JUST BEING NITPICKY HERE, BECAUSE I LOVE THE WHOLE STORY.” OWENS HAS NEVER GOT AWAY FROM JAMES. HIS SILHOUETTES HAVE QUOTED HIM. HIS TALENTED INTERN SEBASTIAN MODELS A JAMES DRESS IN ONE OF THE PHOTOS THAT ACCOMPANY THIS STORY, JUST LIKE JUAN FERNANDEZ, AN OLD FRIEND OF OWENS FROM LA WHO WAS A FIT MODEL FOR JAMES’ EVENING GOWNS DURING THE SEVENTIES WHEN THE DESIGNER WAS LIVING IN THE CHELSEA HOTEL IN NEW YORK. LOPEZ, ANOTHER CHELSEA RESIDENT, WOULD SKETCH THE WHOLE PROCESS. OWENS PROVIDED THE PREFACE FOR CHARLES JAMES: THE COUTURE SECRETS OF SHAPE, A RECENT MONOGRAPH IN WHICH HE WRITES, “JAMES’ CLOTHES WERE ABOUT ORDER, RIGOUR, AND DISCIPLINE… IDEAS THAT SUGGESTED AN ELEVATED CODE I ADMIRED AND WANTED TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH. THESE CLOTHES COULD PERVERSELY SPEAK ABOUT RESTRAINT AND THE JOY OF SUMPTUOUSNESS AT THE SAME TIME.” FERNANDEZ IS ALSO A FOCUS IN ANOTHER OF OWENS’ SIDE PROJECTS, THE BOOK HE HAS CURATED FOR RIZZOLI ABOUT LARRY LEGASPI, WHO, AS THE DESIGNER OF COSTUMES FOR KISS, WAS UNWITTINGLY RESPONSIBLE FOR INTRODUCING TEENAGE OWENS TO “THE GLORY OF LUST AND VICE”. LEGASPI DESIGNED FOR ALL-FEMALE FUNK GROUP LABELLE AS WELL, AND THE SPIRIT OF HIS SCI-FI/DECO CREATIONS RESONATES IN OWENS’ WORK. IN HIS BOOK ABOUT LEGASPI, ESPECIALLY IN HIS INTERVIEWS WITH HIS WIDOW VALERIE, AND WITH FERNANDEZ AND THE ARCHETYPAL MODEL/MUSE PAT CLEVELAND, HIS VICARIOUS FASCINATION WITH THEIR MELANCHOLIC WORLD – SMOTHERED BY THE AIDS-INDUCED LOSS OF SO MUCH BEAUTY, YOUTH AND TALENT – IS SO INTENSE IT OFFERS AN ILLUMINATING INSIGHT INTO HIS OWN CREATIVE DRIVE. AT ONE POINT, FERNANDEZ TELLS OWENS, “YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF YOUR EGO AND JUST SORT OF TAKE IN EVERYTHING, BECAUSE AS A DESIGNER, YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HEART AND YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR CREATIVITY. THEN, IF YOU ARE REALLY CLEVER, YOU TAKE A LOOK AROUND AT WHAT IS GOING ON ACROSS THE PLANET AND YOU GO, ‘OH.’ STEAL LOVE, STEAL IDEAS, STEAL A FEELING. THAT IS THE RENAISSANCE OF OUR ART. THE MOMENT THAT WE STOP DOING THAT, WE DON’T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY. AND WE MAY AS WELL JUST BE DEAD.” IN THAT LIGHT, OWENS’ WORK IS CONSTANTLY STEALING LOVE, AS HE IS ALSO CONSTANTLY BALANCING THE THEFT BY GIVING CREDIT WHERE HE FEELS CREDIT IS DUE. BUT THE LOVE IS TAINTED. “I’M DRAWN TO CHARACTERS LIKE CHARLES JAMES AND ANTONIO LOPEZ AND DES ESSEINTES [JEAN DES ESSEINTES, THE PROTAGONIST OF HUYSMANS’ AGAINST NATURE]. THERE WAS A DARKNESS IN DES ESSEINTES, AN EVIL STREAK. HE WAS SO MISANTHROPIC AND SCORNFUL OF SOCIETY WHEN HE WAS BUILDING HIS BUBBLE, AND I HATE THAT BECAUSE I FEEL MY FATHER INFECTED ME WITH THAT. I ROLL MY EYES SOMETIMES AT THINGS AND I CATCH MYSELF AFTERWARDS AND I THINK THAT WAS NOT COOL. I FEEL MY DAD INFECTED ME WITH HIS JUDGINESS. ON THE OTHER HAND I KNOW THAT’S SOMETHING I NEED ANYWAY. I’M JUDGING THINGS ALL DAY LONG, I HAVE TO CORRECT AND REFINE EVERYTHING I’M MAKING, SO THAT’S JUST PART OF EVERYTHING I NEED TO BE.” “I’M CONSCIOUS OF APOLOGISING, BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE APOLOGISE TOO MUCH.” NOW WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THE HOT-TICKET ISSUE OF APPROPRIATION. “I TOTALLY BORROWED FROM HIP-HOP. THE BIG BASKETS AT THE BEGINNING WERE ABOUT RUN DMC AND THE FAT BOYS. THE BIG, BAGGY CLOTHES, THE T-SHIRTS, THE WHOLEGANG THING WASN’T BLACK, THAT WAS THE MEXICAN CULTURE IN PORTERVILLE, FROM THE PEOPLE I WAS WORKING WITH AT TACO BELL. THEY’D GIVE ME RIDES HOME IN THEIR LOWRIDERS.” OWENS IS ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF THE SPEED OF CHANGE. HE FEELS HE WOULDN’T NOW BE ABLE TO DO A SHOW LIKE HIS SPRING/SUMMER 2014 SPECTACLE, WHICH WAS PERFORMED BY STEP TEAMS FROM SORORITIES AT FOUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COLLEGES. “I WAS WATCHING THE BEYONCÉ AT COACHELLA MOVIE [HOMECOMING],” HE ADDS. “SHE COULD DO IT.” I’M CURIOUS. HAS THE FLAGRANTLY FEARLESS OWENS BECOME NEWLY SENSITISED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT? “NO MORE THAN BEFORE,” HE SAYS, THE DRAWL NEVER MORE POINTED. “I’VE SHOWN GUYS WITH THEIR D CKS OUT, WOMEN CARRYING EACH OTHER ON THEIR BACKS, STEPPERS, STOMPERS... I KIND OF LIVE IN A BUBBLE, BUT EVERYONE HAS TO BE AWARE OF WHAT’S AROUND THEM. I DON’T REALLY FOLLOW THE NEWS ON TV THAT MUCH, BUT I HAVE A GENERAL SENSE OF DISCOMFORT IN CERTAIN AREAS. I FEEL LIKE I’M TRYING TO PUT IN MY LITTLE NOTE, TO TRY TO BALANCE THINGS OUT BECAUSE EVERY LITTLE VOICE HELPS. I’M COMMENTING ON THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT THINGS. I DON’T HAVE ANY SOLUTIONS, I FEEL LIKE I’M SPEAKING TO CONCERNS WE’RE ALL FEELING COLLECTIVELY.” HIS COMMENTARY FINDS EMOTIONAL VOICE IN HIS MEN’S SHOW A FEW WEEKS LATER, WHEN HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE IS VERY MUCH ON HIS MIND. THE WALL THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SO INTENT ON BUILDING WOULD SEPARATE HIS MOTHER, NOW 85 YEARS OLD, FROM HER FAMILY IN MEXICO, AT A TIME WHEN SHE NEEDS THEM MORE THAN EVER. I FEEL HER STORY INFUSES HER SON’S PRESENTATION. HE NAMES IT TECUATL, HIS GRANDMOTHER’S MIXTEC MAIDEN NAME, AND INVITES FOUR DANZA AZTECA MUSICIANS FROM MEXICO TO ACCOMPANY THE SHOW WITH CEREMONIAL SOUNDS. ALL OF WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO OWENS’ DECLARATION THAT HE IS MORE INSULATED NOW THAN HE EVER WAS IN PORTERVILLE. SAME THING WHEN HE REFLECTS ON FASHION’S EFFORTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE TYRANNY OF SOCIAL MEDIA. “A MAGPIE SENSIBILITY, EVERYTHING ALL TOGETHER, ALL THE TIME, NO LOYALTY TO ANY BRAND, EVERYTHING THROWN TOGETHER IN YOUR OWN STYLE.” AFTER LISTING THIS LITANY OF CHAOS, HE PAUSES FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT (HAVE I EVER MENTIONED WHAT A GREAT ACTOR HE WOULD MAKE?). “PEOPLE OVERESTIMATE THEIR OWN SENSE OF STYLE. THAT’S WHAT DESIGNERS ARE FOR. I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. THERE’S THAT WORLD AND I’M THE OPPOSITE OF IT, AND I PROBABLY STAND OUT BECAUSE IF YOU’RE NOT INTO IT, I’M ONE OF THE FEW OTHER OPTIONS THAT’S NOT THAT. PEOPLE RECOGNISE ME BECAUSE I’M MORE FOCUSED.” HE PONDERS A WHILE LONGER. “FOR A COMPANY TO SURVIVE, IT’S IN CONSTANT COMPETITION WITH INSTAGRAM IMAGERY. THERE WILL BE A REACTION TO THAT BUT I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S GOING TO BE FASHION. MAYBE MORE ABOUT ECOLOGICAL PURSUITS. MAYBE IT’S MORE ABOUT SURVIVAL NOW, AND SUSTAINABILITY. MAYBE PEOPLE SHOULD PUT MORE ENERGY INTO THAT. FASHION MIGHT BECOME OBSOLETE, AS WELL MAYBE IT SHOULD.” STILL, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE HE SEES HIMSELF DOING. “I LOVE HOW FASHION IS CHANGING, AND HOW I CAN MAKE IT CHANGE. IT’S STILL VERY STIMULATING. ONCE YOU’VE ESTABLISHED A PLATFORM, IT CAN CHANGE INTO ANYTHING, GO ANYWHERE AT THIS POINT.” OWENS COMPARES WHAT HE DOES TO A TEA CEREMONY. “MY OPULENCE IS VERY CONTROLLED, VERY ARTIFICIAL, A VERY DELIBERATE AND SPECIFIC THING. THE PACING IS VERY ANTI-GLUTTONY, SUMPTUOUS BUT MODEST. YOU’RE APPRECIATING IT IN A MODEST, THOUGHTFUL WAY.” WE’RE TALKING ABOUT BEYONCÉ AGAIN (THAT MOVIE REALLY STAYED WITH HIM). “YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE THROUGH YOUR ART,” OWENS MUSES. “NOT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT, BUT IT’S KIND OF THRILLING WHEN YOU DO IT RIGHT. I THINK MICHÈLE AND I ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT KIND OF THING. OUR RELATIONSHIP DOES REPRESENT THINGS TO PEOPLE.” ALMOST 20 YEARS OLDER THAN OWENS, WITH EVERY ONE OF THOSE YEARS TESTAMENT TO AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE THAT HAS TAKEN HER FROM BEING A LAWYER IN LYON TO THE CHELSEA HOTEL IN NEW YORK TO BEING A DESIGNER/RESTAURATEUR IN LA AND THEN AN ARTIST IN PARIS, LAMY HAS HAD AN INESTIMABLE INFLUENCE ON OWENS’ LIFE. “I THINK SHE’S A GREAT TRAINER TO ENCOURAGE ME TO GO FURTHER,” HE SAYS. “SHE DOESN’T HAVE LIMITS OR MUCH FILTER. SHE RESPONDS TO THINGS IN A VERY EMOTIONAL, INSTINCTIVE WAY THAT IS VERY STIMULATING TO ME. THERE’S A LOT OF ID IN HER.” IF SHE’S ID, IS HE EGO, I WONDER. “OH GOD, YES!” WHICH MAKES THEIR RELATIONSHIP AN EXTENSION OF THE CLASSIC DICHOTOMY BETWEEN APOLLO AND DIONYSUS. OWENS CERTAINLY MANIFESTS APOLLONIAN RIGOUR, NOT ONLY IN THE CONTROLLED OPULENCE OF HIS DESIGNS BUT IN HIS APPROACH TO HIS OWN BODY, MOULDED BY GYM CRAFT INTO RUBBER-BAND TAUTNESS. “BUT IT’S BARELY COVERING UP THE DIONYSUS UNDERNEATH,” HE INSISTS. “IT’S LIKE THIS FILM OVER A THROBBING, DRIPPING DIONYSIAN. THOUGH IT NEVER REALLY ERUPTS. IT’S CAREFULLY FED AND PACED, CAREFULLY TENDED TO.” RELEASE COMES WITH THE INCREDIBLE RITUALS THAT HE MAKES OF HIS SHOWS. “THANK GOD I HAVE THAT,” HE ADDS, TELLINGLY. HE’S TALKING ONCE MORE ABOUT WHY POETRY IS A MORE NATURAL METIER FOR HIM THAN ART. “A POET TAKES EVERYTHING WE KNOW AND MAKES A NEW COMPOSITION OF WORDS THAT ARE LYRICAL AND PUT US IN A MINDSET THAT CAN EITHER MAKE US FEEL BETTER ABOUT OURSELVES OR MORE CONNECTED TO THE WORLD OR MORE COMFORTABLE OR MORE LOVING. I SEEM TO HAVE A WAY OF DOING THESE COMPOSITIONS, LIKE SOME FLORISTS ARRANGE FLOWERS IN A CERTAIN WAY. LARRY LEGASPI, MARIANO FORTUNY, SID VICIOUS, DES ESSEINTES... THEY’RE PART OF THE COMPOSITIONS I MAKE. AND I SET OUT TO DO THEM IN AS FOCUSED A WAY AS POSSIBLE. THAT’S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU’RE ON THIS EARTH. YOU DO YOUR BEST WITH WHAT YOU’VE GOT, UNTIL YOU DIE.” HE SOUNDS LIKE FERNANDEZ. ONCE UPON A TIME, OWENS TOLD A REPORTER, “EVERYTHING TO ME BOILS DOWN TO A CHALLENGE TO MORTALITY. YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WILL OUTLAST YOU, YOU WANT TO LEAVE SOMETHING – YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER. IT’S THE HUMAN CONDITION.” WHEN I ASK HIM IF THAT IS STILL THE CASE, HIS ANSWER IS INSTANT. “I STILL FEEL THAT, MORE THAN EVER.” THERE IS EVEN A SUBTLE METAPHOR FOR THE ENDLESS/ENDURING IN HIS WORK. EVERYTHING HE OFFERED IN HIS FIRST, 13-PIECE COLLECTION IN 1994 LIVES ON IN EACH PRE-COLLECTION: THE LEATHER JACKET WITH THE RIBBED INSET SLEEVE, THE BIAS TROUSERS AND SKIRT, THE RIBBED TANK TOP, ALL THE T-SHIRTS. “I LOVE THAT IT’S STILL THE SKELETON OF EVERYTHING WE DO.” ONE FINAL EXCHANGE… RICK OWENS: I’M 57 YEARS OLD AND SOMETIMES I FEEL I GO ON LEARNING, AND OTHER TIMES I SURPRISE MYSELF WITH HOW MUCH I HAVEN’T LEARNT. THERE’S THIS WHOLE UGLY SIDE OF ME THAT I HATE AND I’M SO HORRIFIED BY IT. I GET ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED WHEN PEOPLE CAN’T UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS SHOULD BE. I KNOW EXACTLY WHY I FEEL THREATENED. I HAVE DEADLINES AND I DON’T WANT TO MISS A DEADLINE. SO I GET IMPATIENT WHEN I DON’T GET SATISFYING ANSWERS FAST ENOUGH. HOW CAN I NOT HAVE ERASED THIS BY NOW? WHY IS IT STILL THERE? I WANT TO BE MORE SERENE AND UNDERSTANDING AND MORE EMPATHETIC AND MORE TOLERANT, AND THAT’S THE OPPOSITE OF IMPATIENCE. TIM BLANKS: FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH, I THINK SERENITY IS AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM. RO: I AGREE WITH THAT. I KNOW I’M NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT AND I KNOW I NEED TO RELAX AND NOT WORRY ABOUT IT, BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN FLAWS I THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MINIMISE MORE. TB: OR JUST BE PICASSO AND EXALT THEM. RO: I THINK ABOUT THAT, TOO. I LOOK AT PICASSO AND THINK, “F CK IT, WHO CARES?” JUST BE A MONSTER, ENJOY IT. TB: MAYBE THAT’S SUBLIMATED IN YOUR WORK. RO: I THINK IT IS. WORKING WITH YOUR FLAWS, ACCEPTING THEM. TB: THERE’S ALWAYS THERAPY. RO: I’VE TRIED IT. BUT I ALSO FEEL, “FIGURE IT THE F CK OUT!” AND THAT’S PART OF LIFE, TOO – THE FUN OF BEING ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT.

IT’S BEST EVIDENCED, OF COURSE, IN HIS FASHION AND FURNITURE DESIGN—BUT THOSE ARE JUST THE TWO MOST READILY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS THAT HE MAKES. THINK BIGGER; THINK OF OWENS’S ENTIRE LIFE, A PLACE WHERE SPHYNX CATS ROAM A BRUTALIST PALACE IN PARIS, WHERE PLATFORM DISCO BOOTS ARE WORN ON THE METRO, WHERE DYEING ONE’S OWN HAIR IS A TRANCELIKE RITUAL. OWENS’S LATEST ENDEAVOR SEES THE DESIGNER OFFERING A WHOLE NEW WAY TO ENTER HIS UNIVERSE: VIA A TOUR BUS. THE RICK OWENS EXPRESS WILL BE ROLLING INTO MILAN WEDNESDAY AS A PART OF A COLLABORATION WITH MONCLER THAT INCLUDES READY-TO-WEAR PIECES DESIGNED FOR OWENS AND HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, AS WELL AS A CUSTOM BUS. WHILE THE PROJECT WILL LAUNCH AT THE SAME TIME AS MONCLER’S 2020 EDITION OF ITS GENIUS PROJECT, OWENS’S COLLABORATION IS TOTALLY SEPARATE. “I’M NOT SURE I’M REALLY A GROUP PERSON,” HE SLYLY SAYS OVER THE PHONE FROM HIS HOME IN PARIS, WHERE HE’S JUST RISEN FROM HIS DAILY AFTERNOON NAP AND WILL SOON HEAD TO MILAN TO PREPARE HIS PRESENTATION. STILL, WHEN MONCLER CAME CALLING OWENS CHOSE NOT TO RESIST. “COLLABORATIONS, UNDER THE WORST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE ALL ABOUT SENSATION AND HYPE. THERE’S NO ONE MORE CONSCIOUS [OF THAT] THAN I AM.” HE SAYS. “I MEAN, I’M THE FIRST TO ROLL MY EYES ABOUT THE COLLABORATION THING, BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF ME THINKS THAT ANY EXCUSE FOR PEOPLE TO INTERSECT, ESPECIALLY IN THE FASHION WORLD—AND ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY LIKE ME—TO GO OUT AND KIND OF INTERSECT WITH OTHER FASHION BUBBLES, IS SOMETHING I REALLY APPROVE OF. I ALSO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO TAKE THE WHOLE COLLAB DYNAMIC AND INSTEAD OF MAKING IT ALL ABOUT BEING OUTWARD AND ALL ABOUT DISPLAY—I MEAN THERE’S PLENTY OF DISPLAY HERE, OBVIOUSLY!—TO TURN IT AROUND AND MAKE IT A STORY ABOUT INTIMACY, ABOUT AUTHENTICITY, AND ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP. IT’S AN INSULAR STORY ABOUT PRIVACY, ABOUT PERSONAL INTIMATE SPACE.” THE PERSONAL MOTIVATOR FOR OWENS TO ACCEPT MONCLER’S OFFER WAS AN INVITATION FROM THE ARTIST MICHAEL HEIZER TO SEE HIS MONUMENTAL LAND ART PIECE, CITY, IN THE NEVADA DESERT. HE AND LAMY HAD BEEN WONDERING HOW AND WHEN TO MAKE THE TRIP OUT WEST TO SEE THE PIECE. “IT’S SPOOKY AND IT’S ECCENTRIC AND IT’S EXTREME AND IT’S HEROIC AND IT’S KIND OF AN UNDERGROUND THING—AND I JUST COULDN’T RESIST. I MEAN, I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE,” OWENS SAYS. WHERE DOES MONCLER COME IN? THE ITALIAN OUTERWEAR BRAND WORKED WITH THE DESIGNER ON A COLLECTION THAT RE-FABRICATES SOME OF HIS AND LAMY’S MOST-WORN GARMENTS INTO HIGH-PUFF MONCLER DOWN. IT ALSO FACILITATED OWENS’S COLLABORATION WITH A TOUR BUS COMPANY, CREATING A BRUTALIST BUS TO TRANSPORT OWENS AND LAMY FROM LOS ANGELES, WHERE HE WOULD BE SIGNING HIS LATEST SET OF BOOKS, TO THE DESERT. “SO IT ALL CAME TOGETHER AND I THOUGHT, OKAY, WELL, WE’LL DO THIS,” HE CONTINUES. HE ARRIVED IN LOS ANGELES IN OCTOBER, HIS FIRST TIME IN THE CITY WHERE HE STARTED HIS CAREER IN 18 YEARS, AND EMBARKED ON THE RIDE TO GARDEN VALLEY, NEVADA, WITH A STOP IN LAS VEGAS ALONG THE WAY. “GOING TO L.A. ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE RETRACING THE STEPS OF WHERE I HAD BEEN UNFORMED: GROWING PAINS AND FRUSTRATED AND STRUGGLING,” HE SAYS. “BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS REALLY LOVELY. GOING BACK TO YOUR ORIGINS STRONGER THAN YOU LEFT THEM IS A VERY PROFOUND THING. NOT IN A GLOATING WAY, OF COURSE, BUT I MEAN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WAY DIFFERENT AND THAT WAS MOVING.” THE JOURNEY TO HEIZER’S PIECE WAS ENTIRELY MONCLER-IFIED, WITH OWENS AND LAMY TRAVELING ON A MATTE BLACK TOUR BUS THAT REPLICATES THE STARK AESTHETIC OF THEIR PARIS AND VENICE HOMES. SAYS OWENS: “IT’S EXACTLY LIKE MY HOUSE, ALL THE INTERIORS, ALL GRAY. I USE THESE ARMY BLANKETS—I’VE BEEN USING THEM SINCE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD—TO UPHOLSTER THE INTERIOR. I’M REFERRING TO JOSEPH BEUYS AND HOW HE CREATED THIS INSULATION [IN HIS WORK]. ARMY BLANKETS, ALSO, HAVE BEEN THESE KIND OF TALISMANS TO PROTECT PEOPLE GOING TO WAR. THE BLANKETS COME BACK AND SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK ALONE. AND THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.... I DON’T ENDORSE WAR AT ALL AND I’M NOT CELEBRATING IT OR GLAMORIZING IT, I’M JUST THINKING, IT’S THE STORY OF LIFE. IT’S THE STORY OF CONFLICT AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM CONFLICT.” THE INSULATED RICK OWENS EXPERIENCE ONLY GETS MORE INSULATED WHEN YOU ENTER THE BEDROOM. “THE BEDROOM IS ALL INSULATED IN MONCLER NYLON DUVET. THERE ARE DUVETS EVERYWHERE,” HE SAYS. IN A PHOTOGRAPH THAT ACCOMPANIES THE COLLABORATION LAUNCH, OWENS AND LAMY LOUNGE IN THE BED WATCHING THE 1923 FILM SALOMÉ, STARRING ALLA NAZIMOVA. ON THE ACTUAL JOURNEY THEY LISTENED TO LAVASCAR—LAMY’S BAND—AND GESAFFELSTEIN. “WE WERE LISTENING TO THEM A LOT BECAUSE WHEN WE WOULD GO ON TRIPS, WE KIND OF OBSESS OVER SOME BAND OR SOMETHING AND WE JUST LISTEN TO IT THE ENTIRE TIME,” OWENS SAYS. WHEN NOT LOUNGING IN BED, OWENS AND LAMY WORE CUSTOM RICK OWENS X MONCLER ENSEMBLES BASED ON EXISTING OWENS SILHOUETTES. “I WAS REALLY THINKING, IF I’M GOING TO DO THIS, WHAT WOULD WE WEAR? HOW CAN I MAKE THIS AS REAL AS POSSIBLE?” THE DESIGNER SAYS. “I MEAN MICHÈLE AND I BOTH LOVE DUVET; I RARELY WEAR LEATHER. WELL, ACTUALLY, I’M WEARING A LEATHER JUMPSUIT JUST BECAUSE IT’S VERY NEW WAVE AND IT’S A LITTLE OVER THE TOP. BUT, I MEAN DUVET IS THE MOST SENSIBLE THING. IT’S WARM, LIGHT, AND JUST CRUSHES UP,” HE PAUSES. “I MEAN, LISTEN TO ME PROMOTING DUVET! BUT IT’S TRUE. IT’S REALLY WHAT I WEAR ALL THE TIME.” THE GARMENTS WILL GO ON SALE THIS YEAR IN MONCLER AND RICK OWENS STORES AS WELL AS ONLINE. YOU CAN BUY THE BUS THROUGH A CUSTOM ORDER. EXPENSIVE? “OF COURSE, IT’S EXPENSIVE,” OWENS SAYS WITH A LAUGH. “IT’S A FORTUNE.” THE PUFF COATS AND SHORTS PROMISE A MORE AFFORDABLE BIT OF INSULATION.

SHE CLAIMS SHE HAS A HEART OF GOLD. HER GOOD FRIEND RICK OWENS THINKS CHRISTEENE IS THE COLLECTIVE ID. WE SAY: CURTAIN UP ON THE WORLD&#39;S MOST DANGEROUS DRAG TERRORIST! RICK OWENS WAS SO ENGROSSED IN HIS WORK THAT HE DIDN&#39;T THINK OF ANYTHING SO MUNDANE AS THE TIME DIFFERENCE WHEN HE SUGGESTED THE INTERVIEW DATE. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CHRISTEENE WAS ENGROSSED IN WHEN SHE AGREED TO HIS PROPOSAL. WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE, IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE EVENING IN NEW YORK, A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE INTERVIEW WAS DUE TO START, THAT SHE REALISED SHE WOULD ONLY BE TALKING TO OWENS – WHO WAS IN ITALY – VIA VIDEO CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND WANTED TO CANCEL SPONTANEOUSLY. BUT AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW EMAILS, SHE CHANGED HER MIND, AND APPEARED PUNCTUALLY BEFORE THE CAMERA, LOLLING AROUND LASCIVIOUSLY IN HER UNDERWEAR AND AN OWENS DRESSING GOWN. THE DRAG ARTIST AND THE FASHION DESIGNER HAVE BEEN BEST FRIENDS SINCE CHRISTEENE&#39;S &quot;BUTT MUSCLE&quot; VIDEO, IN WHICH THEY DO UNSPEAKABLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER. AS BEFITS A GOOD FRIEND, OWENS DID NOT HESITATE FOR A SECOND WHEN CHRISTEENE ASKED HIM TO DO THE INTERVIEW, WHILE CHRISTEENE IN TURN HELPED OWENS TO PREPARE BY SENDING HIM A LIST OF TOPICS TO DISCUSS. THE TOPICS INCLUDED &quot;INTUITION&quot;, &quot;PHYSICAL HEALING THOUGH THE POWER OF THE MIND&quot;, &quot;CHER&quot;, &quot;THE POWER OF KATHY BATES&quot;, &quot;SAXOPHONES AND JAZZ HARPS&quot;, &quot;HIGH SOCIETY SEX CULTS&quot; AND &quot;ART AFTER THE END OF THE WORLD&quot;. WE&#39;RE NOT SURE IF THEY TALKED ABOUT ANY OF THOSE THINGS. RICK OWENS HEY, HOW&#39;S IT GOING? CRISTEENE VALE HOW&#39;S IT GOING? IT&#39;S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THAT&#39;S HOW IT&#39;S GOING, BITCH! RO WHAT TIME IS IT? CV IT&#39;S HALF PAST THREE IN THE MORNING HERE! RO OH, I&#39;M SORRY. CV NO PROBLEM, I&#39;M ALWAYS STILL AWAKE AT THIS TIME ANYHOW. BUT I&#39;M USUALLY HIGH. NOT TODAY THOUGH. I DECIDED TO KEEP A CLEAR HEAD FOR YOU. RO IT WILL PROBABLY DO YOU GOOD. CV I DISCOVERED THAT YOU DREAM MORE IF YOU DON&#39;T SMOKE WEED BEFORE YOU GO TO BED. WEED MAKES YOUR DREAMS DISAPPEAR. RO I WOULDN&#39;T KNOW. I NEVER SMOKED WEED. I ONLY CHAIN SMOKE BEFORE I GO TO BED. I PROBABLY SHOULDN&#39;T. WEED WOULD PROBABLY BE HEALTHIER. CV YOU CHAIN SMOKE CIGARETTES? AT NIGHT? RO OH YEAH! CV SHUT UP! RO I CERTAINLY DO. I SMOKE AND EAT LOTS OF SUGAR AND CAKE... CV DID YOU HAVE SACHERTORTE WHEN YOU WERE IN VIENNA? RO YEAH, VIENNA WAS GREAT. ST. PETERSBURG WAS GREAT TOO, BUT TURIN WAS THE BEST. SCARLETTE (SCARLETTE ROUGE, THE DAUGHTER OF RICK OWENS&#39; WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY) LIVES THERE, AND SHE HAD A BABY WHEN WE WERE THERE. CV DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE A BABY, OR DID YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE THERE WHEN SHE SUDDENLY HAD A BABY? RO NO, WE KNEW SHE WAS HAVING A BABY, BECAUSE IT TAKES NINE MONTHS FOR A BABY TO BE BORN. CV I KNOW. RO YOU SENT ME A LIST OF TOPICS FOR THE INTERVIEW, BUT THE ONLY ITEM ON THE LIST THAT I UNDERSTAND IS &quot;CHER&quot;. CV GREAT! RO OKAY! I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I&#39;VE TOLD YOU, BUT THIS SPOKEN-WORD THING, THE TEXT FROM THAT MOVIE, WHAT&#39;S IT CALLED, &quot;THE TURN OF THE SCREW&quot;? (THE FILM IS BASED ON &quot;THE TURN OF THE SCREW&quot;, A BOOK BY HENRY JAMES). RO YEAH, EXACTLY, &quot;THE TURN OF THE SCREW&quot;, WHICH I STILL HAVEN&#39;T SEEN. CV WHAT? RO I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT YOUR SPOKEN WORD PERFORMANCE AT BERGHAIN WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE. CV THANKS. I LIKE THE WORDS TOO, ESPECIALLY WHEN I PERFORM, BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SHUT UP AND WONDER WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. RO AT FIRST I THOUGHT YOU WERE RECITING SHAKESPEARE. CV THAT WAS DUE TO MY ELOQUENT DELIVERY. YOU GOTTA SEE THE MOVIE, GIRL! TRUMAN CAPOTE CO-WROTE THE SCRIPT. RO THE FILM IS ON MY LIST. CV I ALREADY TOLD YOU ABOUT THE FILM A YEAR AGO. RO BUT MY LIST IS LONG. CV BECAUSE YOU ONLY READ CLEVER BOOKS ALL THE TIME. RO NOT REALLY. THE BOOKS ARE ACTUALLY FULL OF GOSSIP. DO YOU MAKE NOTES BEFORE YOU WORK ON YOUR ALBUM? HOW DO YOU DO IT? CV I SING INTO MY PHONE TO RECORD MY IDEAS, BUT ONLY WHEN I HAVE IDEAS – I MEAN WHEN THEY SUDDENLY COME TO ME. ONCE I WOKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE I DREAMT A HOOK. IN MY SLEEP, I SAID TO MYSELF: &quot;WAKE THE F CK UP, FIND YOUR PHONE AND SING THE HOOK INTO IT.&quot; AND THAT&#39;S EXACTLY WHAT I DID, WITHOUT OPENING MY EYES. I LISTENED TO IT THREE WEEKS LATER AND IT WAS GOOD. RO WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? CV I&#39;M STILL WORKING ON THAT, GIRL. I HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF THESE MOMENTS. THERE WILL BE A SONG CALLED &quot;HEARTS OF PALM&quot;, LIKE THE THINGS YOU EAT. ONE NIGHT I WAS EATING PALM HEARTS WITH A FRIEND IN AUSTIN AND HE SAID: &quot;IN THE SWAMP, HEARTS OF PALM GROW WILD!&quot; I KNEW THAT LINE WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF MY NEXT DAMN F CKIN&#39; HOT JAM. I&#39;D LIKE GRACE JONES TO SPEAK THE LINE FOR ME, AND I&#39;D LIKE HER TO DO IT REALLY SLOWLY. WHEN MY FRIEND SAID IT, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF: &quot;YOU IDIOT, THAT&#39;S THE BEST OPENING LINE I&#39;VE EVER HEARD.&quot; AND THEN THE BEAT COMES IN, BA-BAM, BA-BAM, BA-BAM. ANOTHER PIECE IS CALLED &quot;BEAUCOUP MOROCCO&quot;. RO THE LINE WITH THE PALM HEARTS SOUNDS ALMOST BIBLICAL. CV I HAD NO IDEA THAT PALM HEARTS GROW IN THE SWAMP, BUT MAYBE THEY DON&#39;T. SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME THAT THE TOP OF THE CHRYSLER BUILDING WAS MADE OF HUBCAPS, AND FOR FIVE SECONDS, I BELIEVED THEM. SO I WILL ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PALM HEARTS IN THE SWAMP, TO PRESERVE MY CREATIVITY. RO AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TRACK, THE ONE WITH MOROCCO? CV &quot;BEAUCOUP MOROCCO&quot;? I DON&#39;T KNOW, IT MAKES NO SENSE – BUT IT&#39;S HOT, IT&#39;S FRENCH, AND IT&#39;S MOROCCAN. YOU COULD USE IT FOR THE RUNWAY. RO I&#39;VE ASKED YOU SO MANY TIMES FOR RUNWAY MUSIC, BUT YOU ALWAYS AVOID ME. CV NO I DON&#39;T. RO YES YOU DO. YOU RUN SCREAMING FROM THE ROOM EVERY TIME. CV BECAUSE MY SONGS AREN&#39;T TRANCEY ENOUGH. AND TOO SHORT. RO IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE HOW LONG THEY ARE. IF IT&#39;S ONLY FOUR MINUTES LONG, IT CAN SIMPLY BE EXTENDED. WHAT WAS THE SONG THAT GOES &quot;POSE, SOMETHING, SOMETHING, POSE&quot;? CV THAT&#39;S &quot;T.S.S.P.&quot; AND THE LYRICS ARE &quot;TURN, STARE, SHAKE, POSE&quot;. I CAN SEND IT TO YOU. RO NO, IT&#39;S TOO LATE NOW BECAUSE YOU SPENT TOO LONG PLAYING COY. THE MUSIC I HAVE NOW IS FROM MIKEQ, BUT IT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE YOURS. BASICALLY, WE STOLE YOUR SOUND. CV YOU BASTARD! RO IT SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR AVOIDING ME. CV YOU JUST LEAVE ME LYING IN THE GUTTER WHERE YOU FOUND ME. RO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR THE REST OF THE DAY? CV WELL, WHEN OUR CONVERSATION IS OVER, I&#39;M GONNA GET SOME SLEEP, AND THEN... OH, I GOTTA SHOW YOU THIS. I BOUGHT A BACKPACK FOR MY CAT TICKLES PICKLES SO I CAN TAKE HIM OUT TO CENTRAL PARK. I HAVE TO SHOW IT TO YOU. LOOK! CAN YOU SEE IT? RO YES. CV THIS GLASS THING (POINTS TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN ASTRONAUT&#39;S HELMET) IS A WINDOW FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH. RO THAT&#39;S THE WEIRDEST THING EVER! COULD YOU PLEASE PUT THE BACKPACK ON FOR ME? CV ONLY WITHOUT THE CAT, BECAUSE HE STILL HASN&#39;T GOTTEN USED TO IT. ISN&#39;T THE BACKPACK AMAZING? I WILL GET DOLLED UP TOMORROW, PUT TICKLES PICKLES IN MY BACKPACK, GO TO CENTRAL PARK AND THEN TAKE HIM ON A WALK WITH A LEASH. RO THE THING LOOKS EXACTLY AS IF DIOR WOULD COPY IT. CV THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IT FIRST. RO IT&#39;S PROBABLY ALREADY PART OF YOUR NEXT SHOW. WHERE DID YOU FIND IT? CV SOMEONE GAVE ME A BACKPACK FOR TICKLES PICKLES FOR CHRISTMAS, BUT IT WAS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR THE POOR CAT. SO I WENT TO MY COMPUTER AND DID A SEARCH FOR &quot;FAT CAT BACKPACK&quot;, AND THAT WAS THE RESULT. RO AND YOU&#39;RE GONNA LET TICKLES OUT IN CENTRAL PARK ON A LEASH? CV YEAH! RO WHAT A SPECTACLE! CV I KNOW. DO YOU WANT ME TO FILM IT? RO I THINK WE ALL WANT YOU TO DO THAT. TOMORROW, WHILE I AM WORKING AWAY TEDIOUSLY HERE IN ITALY, I WILL THINK OF YOU AND TICKLES IN CENTRAL PARK. IT WILL LIFT MY SPIRITS IN NO TIME; IT WILL GIVE ME HOPE. CV I MUST COME AND VISIT YOU IN ITALY SOMETIME. RO MY MOTHER WAS JUST HERE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME. CV WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG? RO I&#39;M NOT GOOD AT SHARING. CV YOU LIKE SHARING WITH ME. RO YEAH, YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING OF MINE. CV DID YOUR MOTHER LIKE IT IN ITALY? RO YES. WAITING FOR THE BABY WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS KIND OF CUTE. AND HOLDING A BABY IN MY ARMS FOR SUCH A LONG TIME WAS GREAT TOO. CV DID MICHÈLE LIKE THE BABY? RO YEAH, SHE LOVES BABIES, AND BABIES LOVE HER. BECAUSE HER TEETH ARE SO SHINY. WHAT DID YOU DO AT CHRISTMAS? CV I ATE GUMBO. RO WERE YOU WITH YOUR FAMILY? CV I WAS IN LOUISIANA, WHERE THEY FEED ME GUMBO EVERY YEAR. RO I NEVER ASKED YOU ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. CV I DON&#39;T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM. I REMEMBER DIRT AND WOODS. AND I KEEP ENDING UP DOWN IN LOUISIANA, WHICH IS WHERE I THINK MY FAMILY PROBABLY CAME FROM. I ALSO TALK LIKE I COME FROM DOWN THERE, CAJUN FRENCH. RO WERE YOU RAISED THERE? CV I DON&#39;T KNOW. RO YOU DON&#39;T KNOW? CV I DON&#39;T REMEMBER MY CHILDHOOD, BUT IT FEELS LIKE I SPENT IT THERE. ALSO BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THERE GIVE ME FOOD IN WINTER. THEY GIVE ME GUMBO AND ÉTOUFÉE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT ÉTOUFÉE IS? RO NO, WHAT IS IT? CV CRAWFISH STEW. I&#39;LL COOK IT FOR YOU NEXT TIME I&#39;M IN PARIS. RO YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO THAT, BUT I DOUBT I WILL EAT IT. CV BUT YOU USUALLY EAT FISH. RO YEAH, BUT IT SOUNDS KIND OF WEIRD. CV IT&#39;S A STEW WITH CRAWFISH AND TOMATOES. RO I DON&#39;T LIKE TOMATOES. BAKE ME A CAKE INSTEAD. DID YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE THINK YOU&#39;RE DIABOLICAL? CV MY FACE DOESN&#39;T LOOK VERY FRIENDLY, BUT I HAVE A HEART OF GOLD. RO I LIKE IT WHEN YOU ARE CRUEL TO PEOPLE. YOU SHOULD BE MORE AGGRESSIVE. CV I ALREADY AM, GIRL! I WAS JUST IN L.A. OH MY GOD, THE THINGS I DID TO PEOPLE! I TOOK A DRINK OUT OF A WOMAN&#39;S HAND, TOOK A SIP, SPAT IT IN THE FACE OF THE PERSON NEXT TO HER AND THEN POURED THE REST ONTO HER HEAD. SHE LOVED IT. AND I LIKE HITTING PEOPLE IN THE FACE WITH A NICE STRONG SLAP. I YELL AT THEM UP CLOSE, SLAP THEM AND THEN JUST KEEP WALKING. PEOPLE LIKE THAT. RO IN A TEXT I ONCE DESCRIBED YOU AS OUR COLLECTIVE ID. THAT&#39;S WHAT IS SO APPEALING ABOUT YOUR ART – THAT YOU&#39;RE SO UNINHIBITED. IT&#39;S WHAT YOUR FANS PROJECT ON YOU, BECAUSE THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE AS UNINHIBITED AS YOU ARE. CV BUT I ONLY ATTACK PEOPLE WHO I HAVE A CONNECTION WITH. SOMETHING HAS TO ATTRACT ME TO THEM. ACTUALLY, THE ONLY TIME I GO FOR PEOPLE IS WHEN THEY TAKE OUT THEIR PHONE. I TAKE THE PHONE AND STICK IT UP MY ASS. RO WHY? CV PARTLY BECAUSE THEN THEY GET A VIDEO ON THEIR PHONE WHERE CAN THEY SEE IT GOING UP MY ASS – I LIKE THAT IDEA. AND ALSO BECAUSE A LITTLE BIT OF ME STICKS TO THEIR PHONE. IF THEY WANT SO MUCH OF ME THAT THEY HAVE TO FILM ME, THEN THEY CAN HAVE EVERYTHING. RO AND DO YOU REALLY MANAGE TO SHOVE A PHONE UP YOUR ASS? CV NOT COMPLETELY, BUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. A CORNER, MAYBE. THE IPHONE 11 IS SO BIG! MY JOB IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER! RO YOU NEED MORE PRACTICE. CV I GET THAT EVERY TIME I HAVE A SHOW, BUT I&#39;M CERTAINLY NOT GONNA PRACTICE AT HOME WITH MY OWN PHONE. I DO THAT ON STAGE. AND I HAVE NEVER DROPPED A PHONE IN THE PROCESS, EVER. THAT&#39;S WHAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF. THEY TREAT THEIR PHONES AS IF THEY WERE THEIR CHILDREN. IT&#39;S LIKE RIPPING A BABY FROM THEIR ARMS – PEOPLE GO CRAZY! THEY GET REALLY AFRAID. PANIC IS WRITTEN ALL OVER THEIR FACES. THAT&#39;S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT – THAT THEY&#39;RE NOT FREAKING OUT OVER A BABY, BUT OVER A DAMN MACHINE. RO BUT IT&#39;S NOT JUST A MACHINE. PHONES REPRESENT SO MANY THINGS IN PEOPLE&#39;S LIVES. ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM, AND CONTACT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. I ALSO SOMETIMES ROLL MY EYES WHEN I SEE HOW DEPENDENT PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR PHONE. ON THE OTHER HAND, TODAY A PHONE IS ALMOST LIKE A TOTEM, AN AMULET, OR A MAGIC WAND THAT ALLOWS US TO CONNECT. I UNDERSTAND THE ADDICTION. IN MY OPINION, CRITICISING THAT IS TOO EASY A GOAL. I&#39;M NO DIFFERENT MYSELF. AND WOULD IT REALLY HELP THE WORLD IF PEOPLE WEREN&#39;T CONSTANTLY ON THE PHONE? WOULD WE BE MORE IN TUNE WITH REAL LIFE? WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN? CV WELL, PHONES ARE REAL LIFE TODAY, BUT THAT DOESN&#39;T MEAN THAT PEOPLE SHOULD FORGET THEIR MANNERS. WHEN SOMEONE COMES UP TO ME ON THE PHONE AND ASKS &quot;CAN I TAKE A PICTURE? CAN I TAKE A PICTURE?&quot; THEN FIRST I ASK &quot;AND WHAT&#39;S YOUR NAME? WHAT&#39;S YOUR MAMA&#39;S NAME? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?&quot; I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING BEFORE THEY TAKE A PICTURE. RO THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH CONTACT FOR ME, ESPECIALLY SINCE PEOPLE DON&#39;T RESPECT PERSONAL SPACE THESE DAYS. THEY PUT THEIR ARM AROUND YOU, TELL YOU HOW TO STAND, AND THAT YOU SHOULD SMILE MORE... CV AND THE WORST THING IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PHOTOGRAPHY, THEY NEVER KNOW HOW TO TAKE PICTURES. THEY KNOW HOW TO FIND THEIR WAY TO THE NEXT STORE WITH THEIR PHONE, HOW TO NAVIGATE IN THE CAR WITH IT, AND HOW TO FIND SEX PARTNERS – BUT WHEN THEY WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE, THEY&#39;RE SCREWED. THAT&#39;S WHY I ALWAYS GRAB THEIR PHONES OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND SAY, &quot;LET ME DO IT, F CKFACE!&quot; RO WHEN WILL YOU BE IN PARIS AGAIN? CV NO IDEA. FIRST I&#39;M GONNA TOUR THE US DURING THE DAMNED UPCOMING ELECTION CAMPAIGN. AND I WANT TO PERFORM IN ALL THE SMALL COUNTRY TOWNS. I WILL GET THE MONEY FOR IT LIKE ROBIN HOOD IN THE BIG CITIES AND THEN PLAY THE COUNTRY TOWNS FOR FREE FOR ALL THE LITTLE QUEENS AND QUEER KIDS, AND I WILL ARRANGE MY PERFORMANCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH MOON PHASES AND PAGAN HOLIDAYS. THE TOUR STARTS IN MAY. I WILL LEAVE MY CAVE AT ALL TIMES OF YEAR AND VISIT ALL THE SHITTY CITIES BEFORE DISAPPEARING INTO MY CAVE AGAIN. RO COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOUR AND GO TO PORTERVILLE TOO? CV IS THAT WHERE YOU COME FROM? RO I WAS RAISED THERE. CV THAT&#39;S WHAT I THOUGHT. I ASK ALL MY MOST IMPORTANT LOVERS, MY FAMILY AND MY FAVOURITE PEOPLE WHERE THEY COME FROM. THAT WILL BE THE BASIS OF MY TOUR. Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

HE STORED THE OVERFLOW IN THE BASEMENT. IT WAS ALWAYS COLD DOWN THERE, AND SINCE IT HAD A CRAWL SPACE CONNECTED TO THE OUTSIDE, IT ALWAYS SMELLED LIKE DAMP DIRT. THESE MUST HAVE BEEN DAD’S SECOND-CHOICE BOOKS – THE ONES UPSTAIRS WERE THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY, WHILE THE BASEMENT HAD THE STUFF HE PROBABLY CONSIDERED FLUFF. I FOUND KENNETH ANGER’S HOLLYWOOD BABYLON, PROUST’S REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST (THE MONCRIEFF TRANSLATION), JK HUYSMANS’ À REBOURS, SOME COLETTE, AND ALBUMS OF SILENT-MOVIE STARS AND SET DESIGNS, ALL OF WHICH FORMED THE AESTHETIC I ALL-TOO-CONSTANTLY PROMOTE. THE CECIL B DEMILLE BIBLE EPICS ESPECIALLY HELD MY ATTENTION – LURID BLACK-AND-WHITE GLAMOUR SEEN THROUGH AN ART-DECO FILTER, WITH A SEARCH FOR HIGHER MEANING AND THEN A TIDY MORAL ENDING. BUT IF THE BIBLICAL STORIES WERE ALL GREY, GLITTERING, OPULENT EXCESS, THERE WAS A MINIMALIST DEPARTURE IN THE HANDFUL OF MOVIES STARRING AND PRODUCED BY ALLA NAZIMOVA, THE RUSSIAN ACTRESS WHO GAINED TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY FAME ONSTAGE IN CLASSIC IBSEN PLAYS BUT FOUND SILENT HOLLYWOOD LEGEND ONSCREEN. I WAS SPECIFICALLY DRAWN TO HER VERSIONS OF ALEXANDRE DUMAS’ CAMILLE (1921), AND OSCAR WILDE’S SALOMÉ (1923), BOTH CRITICAL AND COMMERCIAL FAILURES. THEY WERE ART DIRECTED BY NATACHA RAMBOVA (BORN WINIFRED SHAUGHNESSY), WHOSE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH NAZIMOVA HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARLY DEFINED – MOST GAY ALLIANCES DURING THIS PERIOD HAVE COME TO LIGHT BUT THEIRS HAS NEVER BEEN CONFIRMED. THE IMAGES IN MY DAD’S BASEMENT BOOKS HAD A CARDBOARD-CUT-OUT QUALITY THAT ONLY ENHANCED THE SENSE OF SOPHISTICATED ARTIFICE I READ INTO THEM. THE MINIMALISM IN THEIR ART DIRECTION WAS SURELY BASED ON BUDGET – OR WAS IT? BOTH MOVIES OWE A HUGE DEBT TO AUBREY BEARDSLEY, WHO HAD DIED AT THE AGE OF 25, ONLY ABOUT 20 YEARS BEFORE THE MOVIES WERE MADE. THE BEARDSLEY INFLUENCE IS SUGGESTED IN CAMILLE BUT ABSOLUTELY BLATANT IN SALOMÉ. NAZIMOVA’S MODERNISED VERSION OF CAMILLE IS SET IN CURRENT DAY PARIS, MEANING 1921, THE YEAR THE MOVIE WAS MADE. ART NOUVEAU HAD BEEN INTRODUCED AT THE 1900 EXPOSITION UNIVERSELLE IN PARIS AND IN THIS MOVIE YOU CAN SEE HOW ITS SINUOUS LINES ARE ALREADY STARTING TO SIMPLIFY TOWARDS ART DECO, WHICH WOULD BE INTRODUCED IN 1925. PAUL POIRET’S ELONGATED STYLE, ART NOUVEAU EXPRESSED IN FASHION WAS MAKING ITS TRANSITION TOO, IN THE LIGHTNESS AND SHEERNESS OF MARGUERITE’S/NAZIMOVA’S COSTUMES. I ONLY SAW PICTURES OF THESE MOVIES IN MY DAD’S BOOKS, BUT BY THE TIME I WAS ON MY OWN LIVING IN HOLLYWOOD, I HAD THE VIDEO CASSETTES AND WATCHED THEM IN THE BEDROOM OF MY APARTMENT IN A 1920S MEDITERRANEAN REVIVAL BUILDING ON GRACE AVENUE – ONE CRACK-INFESTED BLOCK ABOVE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. I HAD COVERED THE TALL BEDROOM WALLS AND WINDOWS WITH A DARK BLACK AND GOLD MOIRÉ BROCADE THAT A FRIEND LATER REMEMBERED AS DECAYING PEACOCK FEATHERS; VERY NAZIMOVA. NOW I WATCH THESE MOVIES ON TV IN MY GREY, CRUMBLING CONCRETE BEDROOM IN PARIS WHILE I SHOWER IN THE MORNINGS, LISTENING TO OPERA. CAMILLE OPENS WITH A SCENE AT AN ART NOUVEAU INTERPRETATION OF THE ACTUAL OPÉRA GARNIER’S NAPOLEONIC GILDED GRAND STAIRCASE. NAZIMOVA ENTERS AS MARGUERITE WEARING A DRAGGING BIAS HALTER DRESS WITH A SHEER BEADED KIMONO OVER IT – I ASSUME IT’S BEADING BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE FABRIC AS IT CLINGS TO HER SHOULDERS AND DRAGS ON THE FLOOR. SHE KIND OF COMES OFF AS A SIMPERING AND CLOYING, FRIZZY-HAIRED CARICATURE UNTIL YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO GET INTO A MOOD OF THEATRICAL EXAGGERATION ... THERE’S SOMETHING GOOD-NATURED AND SELF-AWARE TO THE MINCING AFFECTATIONS YOU CAN MAKE OUT IN THE BLURRINESS OF THE ONLY LO-RES FILM THAT EXISTS. I AM IN BED DRINKING MY COFFEE AND LOOKING AT OVERNIGHT EMAILS, LISTENING TO MONTSERRAT CABALLÉ SINGING LA VERGINE DEGLI’ ANGELI, AS MARGUERITE FLIRTS AND WAVES AND DESCENDS A GREY HECTOR GUIMARD-INSPIRED STAIRCASE ON THE SCREEN. FROM 8:17 THROUGH 9:35 SHE PERFORMS A LITTLE SONG AND DANCE FOR HER DINNER GUESTS IN HER HIGHLY STYLISED APARTMENT – A MAIN ROOM WITH THREE SHEER GLITTERY CURTAINED ARCHES THAT LEAD TO A BEDROOM, A DINING ROOM AND A FOYER WITH A FLOOR FOUNTAIN THAT LOOKS BYZANTINE IN INSPIRATION. THE ULTRA DAINTY AND SIMPLE CHOREOGRAPHY OF HER DANCE EMPHASISES LITTLE HAND FLUTTERS AND POUTING AND SOUNDS INSUFFERABLE BUT IT’S NOT – THERE IS SOME SELF-DEPRECATION IN THE ARM SWINGING SHRUGS AT THE END THAT LEND A RELATABLE, GENUINE CHARM THAT FEELS VERY RENÉE ZELLWEGER. AT THIS POINT I’M WATCHING FROM MY OPEN SHOWER USING AESOP’S GERANIUM LEAF BODY SCRUB WHICH IS BASICALLY LIKE AJAX. I ALSO USE IT FOR HAND-WASHING WINE GLASSES AT MY BEACH PLACE – NO WATER SPOTS. AT 13:00 THERE’S THE WEIRDEST FIREPLACE YOU’VE EVER SEEN – AN ELABORATE, CURVED WEDGE SHAPE WITH A GILDED MOUTH AND GARLANDED MIRRORS THAT FILLS THE SCREEN FOR ALL OF TWO SECONDS IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE. I’M BRUSHING MY TEETH WITH NATURAL BONE TOOTHBRUSHES THAT I HAVE STOCKPILED, SINCE THEY WEAR OUT FAST. I’VE BEEN TRYING SELAHATIN TOOTHPASTE RECENTLY BECAUSE I ADMIRE THE FONT THEY USE ON THE PACKAGING. AT 13:02 MARGUERITE HAS RETREATED TO HER BEDROOM FOR A LITTLE COUGHING FIT AND HER FIRST ROMANTIC ENCOUNTER WITH ARMAND, PLAYED BY RUDOLPH VALENTINO IN HIS SECOND EVER FILM ROLE. HIS FAME IS YET TO COME AND HIS ACTING IS VAGUE AND IT’S HARD TO SEE MUCH PROMISE. SHE FLINGS HERSELF ACROSS GREY SATIN COUCHES IN FRONT OF CIRCULAR WINDOW FRAMES THAT ECHO THE ARCHES IN THE REST OF THE APARTMENT. ALL THE ROUND WINDOWS ARE COVERED AND THE TRANSPARENT ARCHED DOORWAY MAKES THE BEDROOM LOOK LIKE A SOFT, GREY UPHOLSTERED CAGE. 17:56 THROUGH 36:42 IS A WASTE OF TIME – A BUCOLIC SEQUENCE WHERE SHE HAS RETREATED WITH ARMAND TO A COUNTRY HOUSE WITH CONVENTIONALLY UPHOLSTERED COLONIAL FURNITURE THAT SHOWS HER WHOLESOMENESS WHEN REMOVED FROM THE WICKED CITY. I TAKE THIS TIME TO CLOSE MYSELF OFF IN MY BLACK MARBLE WC COMPLETE WITH MATCHING FREESTANDING TOILET SHAPED LIKE A SPARK PLUG. THIS ROOM HAS NO MIRRORS AND IS SOUNDPROOFED, GIVING ME A MOMENT OF COMPLETE AND PROFOUND JEWEL-BOX ISOLATION. 36:42 THROUGH 46:00 FINDS HER BACK IN PARIS AT A NIGHTCLUB FILLED WITH ANOTHER SERIES OF ARCHES THAT ECHOES HER APARTMENT. BUT THESE ARCHES ARE CURTAINED WITH SPIDERWEB MOTIFS BEHIND WHICH SHADOW DANCERS GYRATE SLOWLY. ARMAND/VALENTINO SHOWS A GLIMMER OF STRICKEN EMOTION HERE, GRINNING WITH BITTERNESS AT A GAMBLING TABLE WHEN HE SEES MARGUERITE AT THE TOP OF THE ENTRANCE STAIRCASE. HE’S WITH A CLINGY NEW LADY FRIEND IN A PAUL POIRET LEFTOVER LOOK, COMPLETE WITH HEADDRESS IN A PLATINUM METALLIC LAMÉ. I AM APPLYING BODY MOISTURISER AND FACE MOISTURISER AND HAIR MOISTURISER, REMINDING MYSELF I SHOULD REALLY REMEMBER TO DRINK MORE WATER. AT 46:00, MARGUERITE IS BACK IN HER APARTMENT IN A BED SHAPED LIKE A CONCRETE CRADLE WITH A PORTHOLE NIGHT LIGHT. THERE ARE SCATTERED STYLISED FLOWERS LACQUERED ONTO THE COVE ABOVE HER HEAD THAT HIDE THE BUTTON TO SUMMON HER MAID – I AM TOTALLY KNOCKING THIS OFF FOR MY FURNITURE COLLECTION. I’M NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH THE CONVENTIONAL LACE COVERLET, BUT I JUST PRETEND IT’S SHREDDED WOOL. AT 46:39 THE MOST THRILLING THING HAPPENS – HER MAID PRESSES A BUTTON AND THE SHADE ON ONE OF THE CIRCULAR WINDOWS AUTOMATICALLY SLIDES BACK EXPOSING THE SNOW FALLING OUTSIDE. THERE IS A TRADITIONAL WINDOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET, PRESUMABLY TO EMPHASISE THE HOTHOUSE UNNATURALNESS OF MARGUERITE’S BEDROOM. I AM NOW PULLING MY CLOTHES OUT OF A MIRRORED WARDROBE IN MY DRESSING ROOM – I HAVE A PILE OF 20 FOLDED BLACK COTTON SHORTS, 20 FOLDED BLACK COTTON T-SHIRTS AND 20 FOLDED BLACK CASHMERE SWEATERS TO TAKE ME TO THE GYM AND TO MY OFFICE. LATELY I HAVE TAKEN TO CHANGING TO GO OUT AT NIGHT WHICH I NEVER USED TO DO, PREFERRING THE SIMPLICITY AND MODESTY OF STICKING TO ONE LOOK. BUT NOW I’M IN A SHAMELESSLY RECKLESS MOOD TO GO FURTHER – THE HEELS ARE HIGHER, THE SHOULDER PADS ARE WIDER, THE V NECK IS DEEPER – I WON’T HAVE THESE TITS FOREVER. F CK MODESTY. 1:02 TO 1:09 FINAL SCENE – MARGUERITE IS COUGHING INTO A PILLOW AND I AM OUT THE DOOR.

SUSANNAH FRANKEL: WE HAVE ALL BEEN SPENDING MORE TIME AT HOME. HOW HAS THAT BEEN FOR YOU? RICK OWENS: WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE THE COMFORT OF A LOT OF SPACE, A SLICE OF OUTDOORS AND WE SPENT OUR DAYS UNDER THE TREES READING AND ABSORBING AND LEARNING ABOUT THINGS WE HAD PUT OFF FOR LATER. I READ EDMUND WHITE, I PORED OVER JOSEPH BEUYS DRAWINGS, I STUDIED PIERRE LEGRAIN’S WORK FOR JACQUES DOUCET AND DOUCET’S PATRONAGE OF ROSSEAU, PICASSO AND EILEEN GRAY AND GEORGES HOENTSCHEL. I RESEARCHED ANTHROPOSOPHIC FURNITURE, WE GARDENED, WE PLAYED WITH THE CATS, WE FOLLOWED THE PROGRESS OF OUR BEEHIVES ON OUR ROOF AND THE NEWLY HATCHED DUCKLINGS IN THE GARDENS OFF OUR TERRACE NEXT DOOR. I LISTENED CAREFULLY TO THE FINAL ACTS OF RICHARD STRAUSS’ ELEKTRA AND SALOME WHICH TOOK ON A SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES – STORIES OF MISGUIDED URGENCIES CULMINATING IN A TRANSCENDENT PEAK OF GLORY BEFORE EXTINCTION. SF: WHAT DO YOU FEEL WE WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THIS EXPERIENCE? RO: WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL THE CONTENTION AND DISHARMONY AND THINGS THAT COULD GO ECOLOGICALLY WRONG IN THE WORLD IT’S A MIRACLE WE’VE BEEN SPARED A CRISIS LIKE THIS FOR SO LONG. LIFE IS ALL ABOUT CYCLES AND DEATH AND REBIRTH SO DOING OUR BEST IN THE FACE OF THIS FRAGILITY IS THE MEANING AND GLORY OF LIFE – DOING OUR BEST WHILE WE CAN. WE’RE ALL GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS WITH A LESSON IN HUMILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT’S THE SILVER LINING. SF: HOW WOULD YOU SAY THE PERIOD OF LOCKDOWN CHANGED YOUR VIEW OF THINGS – YOUR VIEW OF THE WORLD? RO: MY MEMORY WILL BE THAT IN THE FACE OF THREAT, WE HAD A MINUTE TO FEEL PROFOUND GRATITUDE. IT MADE ME THINK OF THOSE BOUGUEREAU PAINTINGS SITTING ALONE IN THE LOUVRE – OF NYMPHS BRUSHING THEIR HAIR UNDER TREES IN A GLADE WHILE THEY COMPOSED POETRY IN THEIR HEADS. I FELT THAT WE WERE RECREATING OUR VERSION OF THAT – SUSPENDED TIME ABSORBED IN THE APPRECIATION OF BEAUTY. SF: WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF FASHION IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES – IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES? RO: THE PLEASURE OF GRACE AND BEAUTY IS ONE OF LIFE’S GREATEST REWARDS AND SOME PEOPLE CAN PROVIDE THAT BETTER THAN OTHERS. I’VE BEEN ALLOWED TO BE AN AESTHETIC VOICE SO I FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO BRING THAT TO THE TABLE. I ALWAYS CHOKE AT CALLING FASHION ART. BUT AS THE FASHION WORLD GETS MORE SATURATED AND COMPETITIVE, TO STAND OUT, YOU HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER LEVEL, A LEVEL THAT PRESSES A LOT OF THE SAME BUTTONS THAT ART DOES. THERE WAS A QUOTE ATTRIBUTED TO WINSTON CHURCHILL WHEN ASKED TO CUT ARTS FUNDING IN FAVOUR OF THE WAR EFFORT: “THEN WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?” WAS HIS REPLY. EXCEPT IT WASN’T – THAT QUOTE HAS BEEN EXPOSED AS FABRICATION BUT ISN’T IT COMPELLING AND ABSOLUTELY CONVINCING? DOESN’T IT SOUND JUST RIGHT? HUN [MICHÈLE LAMY] HAS BEEN USING THAT PHRASE AS HER LEITMOTIF FOR YEARS: “WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?” AND I ALWAYS JOKE WITH HER: “WHY DO WE HAVE TO FIGHT AT ALL?!” BUT I SEE HER POINT, TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE AND TAKE A STAND. SF: FASHION MAY BE A FORM OF ESCAPISM – AN ASPIRATION, A DREAM. HOW IS THAT IMPORTANT NOW THAT REALITY FEELS THIS HARSH? OR DO WE KEEP IT REAL? RO: FASHION CAN BE ABOUT ESCAPISM BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE ASPIRATIONAL SIDE OF IT – WANTING TO PRESENT THE SELF YOU HOPE EVENTUALLY TO BECOME. THE WAY YOU HAVE DECIDED TO PRESENT YOURSELF TO OTHERS CAN TELEGRAPH YOUR CHARACTER, IT CAN SIGNAL MODESTY, RESPECT FOR OTHERS, A SENSE OF ORDER. FASHION CAN SUBTLY COMMUNICATE A SET OF VALUE SYSTEMS BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH. THAT’S THE DIRECTION OF FASHION I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN AND I SUSPECT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A NICHE FOR IT.

JUST BEFORE HIS 2020 CFDA AWARD NOMINATION FOR GLOBAL WOMEN’S DESIGNER OF THE YEAR WAS ANNOUNCED, OWENS CAUGHT UP WITH US TO SHARE HIS EXPERIENCES – PERSONAL AND CREATIVE – DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WHICH FORCED THE WORLD TO SHELTER AT HOME. FOR OWENS, THIS MAY HAVE JUST BEEN HIS HAPPY PLACE. CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR QUARANTINE EXPERIENCE. WERE YOU IN PARIS OR ITALY? ASIDE FROM THE THREAT OF THE VIRUS AND THE DAMAGE IT CAUSED TO SOCIETY, WHAT WAS THE BEST AND WORST PART OF IT FOR YOU? I WAS IN PARIS WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. I HAD SPACE, TREES, BOOKS, AND GOOD COMPANY. BEING AWARE OF THE STRESS THE WORLD WAS UNDER JUST MADE ME MORE GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING I HAD. I FELT THAT THE MOST RESPONSIBLE THING I COULD DO WAS TO ABSORB AS MUCH AESTHETIC NOURISHMENT AS I COULD, TO BE READY WHEN IT WAS MY TIME TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD IN MY OWN MINISCULE WAY – BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE FASHION IS PART OF AN AESTHETIC FORCE THAT MOVES CULTURE FORWARD. WHILE I WOULDN’T EXACTLY CALL MYSELF A HUMANITARIAN, THE PURSUIT AND CULTIVATION OF BEAUTY IS ONE OF LIFE’S GREATEST REWARDS. HOW DIFFERENT – IF ANY – WAS THE DESIGN INSPIRATION FOR YOU? I GET THE FEELING YOU HAVE MORE OF AN INTROVERTED APPROACH TO THE EXPERIENCES / IMAGES / MOODS THAT INSPIRE YOUR COLLECTIONS. IS THIS A FAIR ASSESSMENT? I FEEL LIKE I’VE ALWAYS BEEN TALKING ABOUT OUR ETERNAL PERSONAL STRUGGLES. SELFDOUBT, SELF ACCEPTANCE, EMPATHY, EGO, RAGE, SEX – TIMELESS CONCERNS THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY CAN RELATE TO. MY COLLECTIONS AND CLOTHES ARE VERY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AND, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT. WHAT ABOUT THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF PRODUCING THE COLLECTION WHILE IN QUARANTINE? WAS YOUR TEAM/DESIGN STUDIO ACCUSTOMED TO WORKING REMOTELY? WHAT WAS SPECIFICALLY CHALLENGING? REWARDING? WELL, THE SECOND THE FACTORY WAS ABLE TO PARTIALLY OPEN, I WAS THERE. THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE WAS THE MASKS. REDUCING AND DISTILLING AND EDITING IS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE THING TO DO ANYWAY AND GOING MORE EXTREME WAS A FULFILLING CHALLENGE. WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT, A LOT OF YOUR COLLECTIONS HAVE/HAD AN APOCALYPTIC FEEL TO THEM. YOU EVEN MADE MASKS PRIOR TO THIS. WAS THERE A PART OF YOU THAT FELT LIKE THE PANDEMIC WAS APOCALYPTIC? WAS IT WHAT YOU IMAGINED OR DOES SOMETHING ELSE COME TO MIND? WELL, WITH ALL THE CONFLICT, AGGRESSION AND INSTABILITY IN THE WORLD, I THINK IT’S A MIRACLE WE LASTED THIS LONG WITHOUT A GLOBAL CRISIS. I THINK WHAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE AS APOCALYPTIC IN MY WORLD MIGHT JUST BE MY VERSION OF A SORT OF REALISM OR BRUTALISM. IF THE OPPOSITE ENDS OF A THE SPECTRUM ARE DISNEY PINK ESCAPISM OR BLEAK DARK NIHILISM, I’M LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF BALANCE THAT SPEAKS OF BEAUTY WITHOUT DISREGARDING THE FLAWS OF REAL LIFE. AND I LIKE MY FUN HARD, SO WHEN I DO A SHOW, WHAT I MIGHT CONSIDER JOYFUL, SOME MIGHT INTERPRET AS APOCALYPTIC. IS THE DEFINITION OF YOUR LATEST COLLECTION PHLEGETHON A DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY YOU FELT WHILE IN CONFINEMENT AND/OR MAKING THE COLLECTION, “NOT QUITE HELL BUT ON THE WAY THERE?” WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THAT NAME? WE ARE UNDER AN ORGANIC THREAT THAT MIGHT GET WORSE OR FINAL. AN OMINOUS RIVER IN HELL FELT APPROPRIATE. AND I LIKE TO POMPOUSLY USE THE ELEGANCE AND GLAMOUR OF A CLASSICAL REFERENCE. YOU REFERENCE A ‘RIOT CORSAGE,’ AND I FELT THE COLLECTION WAS AN EVEN MORE SO ANARCHIST, LIKE THE PLAIDS AND STRIPES HAD AN EARLY SKA PUNK VIBE. WAS THE DEFIANT MOOD A REACTION TO THE PROTESTING AND RIOTING IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD’S MURDER? SOMETHING ELSE? THE DEFIANCE I TALK ABOUT IS THE ETERNAL PRESENCE OF BIGOTRY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN APART OF THE WORLD AND ALWAYS WILL BE. I SEE IT AS ONE OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROVIDE HORSEF CKING AND PISSDRINKING VIDEOS AS A COUNTERBALANCE TO KEEP THE WORLDS MORAL EQUILIBRIUM. SO REALLY, I’M KIND OF A SAINT. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR JOURNEY OF TRANSITIONING FROM YOUR SPECTACULAR AND DRAMATIC LIVE RUNWAY SHOWS TO AN ONLINE FORMAT. WHAT WAS MOST DIFFICULT AS WELL AS MOST EASY ABOUT THE NEW FORMAT? I WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHOW A QUIETER PERSPECTIVE TO WHO WE ARE, THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY TO DAY INTIMATE PROCESS. I LOVED CHANGING GEARS. I WAS STRUCK BY THE SIMPLE INTIMACY OF THE PRESENTATION THAT REALLY SHOWED THE DESIGNER WORKING ON THE COLLECTION ON A MODEL TO PERFECT THE FINAL SILHOUETTE AND LOOKS. DO YOU THINK THIS IS A SIDE OF YOUR WORK THAT MANY DIDN’T GET TO WITNESS BEFORE? I’VE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE NOW, SO ANYONE INTERESTED IN ME HAS ALREADY SEEN ANY INTROSPECTIVE SIDE TO ME. BUT I GUESS THERE IS A WHOLE NEW GENERATION BECOMING AWARE OF FASHION THAT MIGHT BE SURPRISED. THE MUSIC WAS REALLY GREAT LIKE ALWAYS. HOW DID YOU CHOOSE THIS SOUNDTRACK? I LIKE A PRACTICAL SOLUTION; THESE WERE ALL EXCLUSIVE MIXES FROM PAST SHOWS THAT I KNEW I HAD THE RIGHTS FOR. AND IT MAKES ME CRAZY WHEN THEY SUBSTITUTE SOME LAME GENERIC SOUNDTRACK FOR MY SHOWS ON YOUTUBE. QUARANTINE HAD MADE ALOT OF US REVIEW OUR LIVES AND I HAD BEEN REVIEWING MY CREATIVE LIFE, LEADING ME TO INCLUDE SOME PAST THEMES INTO THIS CURRENT COLLECTION. REVISITING PAST FAVORITE SOUNDTRACKS WAS A FUN PART OF THE PROJECT. DID YOU THINK WHETHER FOLKS WANT TO REALLY DRESS AGAIN? AND IF EVERYONE CONTINUES TO WORK FROM HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, HOW DOES THIS PROPOSITION FACTOR IN WHAT YOU DESIGN? I THINK EVEN YOUR TAILORING HAD AN EASE AND COMFORT THAT MAY INSPIRE SOMEONE TO THROW ON A JACKET FOR THEIR NEXT ZOOM MEETING. THOUGHTS? I THINK EVERYONE’S CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO DRESS. HAVEN’T WE HAD ENOUGH COMFORT DRESSING IN THE LAST DECADE? IF WE’RE GONNA GO DOWN, I’M GOING DOWN IN HEELS AND SHOULDERPADS, NOT A COZY SWEATSUIT. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, RECYCLING/UPCYCLING HAS BEEN A PART OF YOUR WORK LATELY. I LOVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RECYCLED PLASTIC AND LEATHER PATCHES FROM 18 YEARS AGO. DO YOU THINK THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE PANDEMIC REINFORCED A BELIEF IN THIS OR WAS ANY OF IT A RESULT OF CIRCUMSTANCE SUCH AS SLOWED DOWN SUPPLY CHAIN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC? I THINK WE ARE ALL FEELING THAT SOMEHOW THE PANDEMIC WAS CONNECTED TO OUR OVER CONSUMPTION AND WASTE, AND I’M THE FIRST TO ROLL MY EYES AT EARNEST DECLARATIONS OF RECYCLING AND SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS USED AS MARKETING GIMMICKS. BUT HERE’S THE THING – EVEN IF ITS A GIMMICK, IT’S THE BEST GIMMICK IN THE WORLD.

BUT THE WORLD IS SO DIFFERENT NOW, AND THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO OFFEND PEOPLE THAT I FEEL LIKE I’M TRAINING MYSELF TO SUPPRESS MYSELF AS TIME GOES ON.” OWENS’S ORIGINAL FASHION HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS “DRIPPY,” “MONOTONOUS,” AND “PESSIMISTIC,” AND THAT’S STRAIGHT FROM THE DESIGNER’S MOUTH. IN 2002, AFTER NEARLY A DECADE IN BUSINESS IN LOS ANGELES, HE BROUGHT HIS CLINGY, INSECTLIKE SILHOUETTES—TO HIS MANY HOLLYWOOD FANS, A “CULT”—TO THE NEW YORK RUNWAY. HE DIDN’T LINGER, THOUGH. WITHIN TWO YEARS, HE AND HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, HAD SET UP HOME AND STUDIO IN THE CENTER OF THE PARIS OLD GUARD, IN A BUILDING IN THE SEVENTH ARRONDISSEMENT, WHERE OWENS PICKED UP HIS PACE. THE BASICS DIDN’T CHANGE—HE STILL FAVORS THE LOOK OF DISSIPATION—BUT HIS EXPERIMENTS IN MODERN DRAPING AND CONSTRUCTION BECAME NOTHING SHORT OF BREATHTAKING. TODAY, AT 57, OWENS IS ONE OF THE VERY LAST OF THE BIG-NAME INDEPENDENTS STILL STANDING. HE IS ALSO A MOST-LIKED GUY — FUNNY, ACCESSIBLE, ALWAYS UP FOR A RAP ON BRUTALISM. OR KISS. WE SPOKE IN JUNE, SHORTLY AFTER ITALY REOPENED ITS BORDERS. HE WAS ON THE LIDO, IN VENICE, BEFORE DRIVING TO FACTORIES IN THE REGION TO CHECK ON PRODUCTION. HE AND LAMY SPENT THE LOCKDOWN IN PARIS. “IT WAS UNIQUE FOR US TO LIE UNDER A TREE AND READ POETRY,” HE SAID. “IT’S EXCITING TO BE ABLE TO APPROACH THINGS FROM A NEW ANGLE—THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS DOUCHEY—AND TO BE ABLE TO RESET A LITTLE BIT. ALTHOUGH I DON’T HAVE HALF AS MUCH PRESSURE AS THOSE OTHER DESIGNERS WORKING FOR BIG COMPANIES DO, WITH A LOT OF VOICES TO ANSWER TO. BUT BEING INDEPENDENT GIVES ME A WHOLE OTHER SET OF PRESSURES.” ALTHOUGH OWENS RARELY COMMENTS ON POLITICS AND SOCIAL ISSUES, HIS SHOWS HAVE NONETHELESS ALLUDED TO MATTERS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE. SO I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW HE, OF ALL DESIGNERS, MIGHT RESPOND TO IMAGES OF EMPTY STREETS, PEOPLE IN ISOLATION. “I WAS THINKING OF THE NEXT STEP. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A CRISIS LIKE THIS? IN THE PAST — THERE IS THE EASY EXAMPLE OF DIOR AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND HOW, AFTER SO MUCH DEPRIVATION AND RESTRICTIONS ON FABRIC, THE RESPONSE WAS THIS GRAND GESTURE OF USING SO MANY METERS OF FABRIC. THAT WAS REALLY EXCITING. AND I DON’T THINK IT WAS EXCITING JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE ABLE TO BE CONSPICUOUSLY SUMPTUOUS. THERE WAS MORE TO IT. THERE WAS A SENSE OF BRAVADO AND WIT TO THAT GESTURE. AND I’M THINKING, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING TO WORK FOR THIS ONE.” OWENS FEELS THE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY. “THE WORD RESPONSIBILITY IN FASHION — WE DIDN’T HAVE THAT TEN, 15 YEARS AGO. AND NOW WE DO. THAT’S KIND OF A GREAT THING. SURE, IT CAN BE A GIMMICK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. I MEAN, PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED ON THE SUSTAINABILITY BANDWAGON. BUT AS FAR AS GIMMICKS GO, THAT’S A PRETTY GOOD GIMMICK. IF ONLY 3 PERCENT OF IT IS AUTHENTIC, THAT’S ALREADY A WIN.” BUT CAN ANYTHING DUTIFUL EVER BE STYLISH? OWENS ISN’T SURE. “AFTER THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE, RESPONSIBILITY IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK ABOUT. I DON’T KNOW HOW IT’S GOING TO MANIFEST IN CLOTHES, EXACTLY. IT WON’T BE WITTY. ANY REAL CHIC HAS ALWAYS HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR. ALMOST A TOUCH OF CAMP, BORDERING ON RIDICULOUS.” HE’S TRYING TO ANALYZE THINGS LOGICALLY. “THERE’S AN ITALIAN HOUSE I’M NOT GOING TO NAME, AND I WATCHED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WHAT THEY DID. THIS EXPRESSION OF RECKLESS VORACIOUSNESS. THE MESSAGE WAS ‘WE’RE TAKING THE MOST EXQUISITE THINGS AND PILING THEM ON TOP OF EACH ANOTHER.’ THEY WERE SAYING, ‘WE DON’T HAVE THE TIME NOR THE NECESSITY TO APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF ALL OF THE ELEMENTS.’ IT WAS THRILLING, IT WAS ATTRACTIVE, BUT I WAS THINKING, THIS IS MORALLY WRONG. YOU ARE DELIBERATELY OVERLOOKING THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL, BEAUTIFUL THINGS.” THAT BOTHERED HIM, BUT HE KNEW IT MADE HIS OWN PATH CLEARER. “FASHION WILL ALWAYS BE 80 PERCENT STATUS,” HE SAID. “THERE ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WAYS OF EXPRESSING STATUS—INTELLECTUAL STATUS, FINANCIAL STATUS. MARGIELA WAS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF AN ANTI-STATUS STATUS. HE HAD MORE STATUS THAN STATUS. YOU WERE SAYING, ‘I’M ABOVE STATUS,’ WHEN YOU WORE MARGIELA, WHICH IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF STATUS. EVEN IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF HUMILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY, THOSE WHO SHOW IT WILL BE THE MOST HUMBLE OF ALL.” HE PAUSED AND LAUGHED. “YEAH, THAT’S CYNICAL, ISN’T IT?” PERHAPS, BUT HIS GRATITUDE SHOWED THROUGH. “I HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL SPACE IN PARIS WITH TREES, AND I’M READING. ONE OF THE WRITERS I WAS READING WAS EDMUND WHITE, HIS NOVEL THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY. IT’S ABOUT LETTING GO AND NEGOTIATING DEATH. I WAS ALSO LISTENING TO SALOME, MY FAVORITE OPERA.” IN AN OPERA, THERE’S USUALLY A FANTASTIC DEATH SCENE, AND OWENS HAS FOUND COMFORT IN THE STORIES. “WE ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF POSSIBLE ANNIHILATION. HOW HAVE WE DONE IT IN THE PAST? HOW DID WHITE NEGOTIATE THE DEATH OF HIS LOVER? HOW DID SALOME DEAL WITH THE REJECTION OF JOHN THE BAPTIST?” OWENS HAS BEEN PLOWING THROUGH BOOKS HE’S NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO READ. HE’S BEEN ENJOYING THE SUN, MAKING BEAUTIFUL DINNERS WITH LAMY, LIGHTING THE CANDLES ON THE TERRACE EVERY NIGHT, AND KEEPING TRACK OF HIS IDEAS. “I HAVE LISTS AND LISTS AND LISTS. MASTER LISTS AND SUBLISTS. AND I HAVE LISTS THAT I’VE DONE FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS WITH A SUBLIST THAT PERTAINS TO THE NEXT COLLECTION. THEY’RE JUST WEIRD LITTLE NOTES TO MYSELF.” HE ADDED, “I DO XEROXES OF MY PAST COLLECTIONS AND THEN I DRAW OVER THEM TO SEE WHERE I’LL GO NEXT. THOSE ARE MY FIRST NOTES TO START.” AT THE MOMENT, OWENS AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN ORGANIZING A DIGITAL SHOWROOM TO SELL THEIR SPRING 2021 OFFERINGS, WHICH WAS IN THE WORKS BEFORE THE LOCKDOWN. HE PLANS TO PRESENT THOSE CLOTHES IN SOME INTIMATE FORMAT IN SEPTEMBER AND THEN PRODUCE SMALL BATCHES FOR STORES. OWENS SAID, “I BELIEVE IN FASHION SHOWS, FOR SURE. THEY’LL COME BACK. PEOPLE NEED TO COLLECT TOGETHER AND BE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WATCHING SOMETHING TRANSCENDENT. THAT WILL HAPPEN FOREVER.” HE ADDED, “I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE ESPLANADE A FEW NIGHTS AGO HERE IN PARIS, AND IT WAS FULL OF KIDS SITTING ON THE GRASS.” THERE HAD BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT PARIS THAT WEEK IN SUPPORT OF BLACK LIVES MATTER AND ALSO PROTESTS AGAINST THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. “IT WAS GLORIOUS. JUST THAT SENSE OF UNITY. EVERYBODY WAS COOL, BUT SOMEWHERE BENEATH IT ALL, THEY WERE CLINGING TO EACH OTHER.” OWENS AND I AGREED THAT IT WAS TOO SOON TO CONSIDER HOW FASHION MIGHT REFLECT THE SOLIDARITY AS WELL AS THE ANGER OF THIS TIME, IF INDEED IT EVER COULD WITHOUT SEEMING TO PROFIT FROM IT. “I DON’T KNOW. I DON’T THINK SO,” HE SAID. “NERVES ARE JUST SO RAW RIGHT NOW.” CERTAINLY, THOUGH, THERE HAS BEEN A SHARP REEVALUATION OF ATTITUDES. I RECALLED A 2013 SHOW HE DID USING BLACK STEP DANCERS FROM THE WASHINGTON, D.C., AREA, A SHOW THAT GARNERED RAVE REVIEWS (MYSELF INCLUDED) FOR HOW OWENS, LONG A CHAMPION OF RUNWAY DIVERSITY, HAD DONE SOMETHING TRULY UPLIFTING AND INCLUSIVE. “CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I HAD TRIED TO DO THAT STEP SHOW NOW, EVEN LAST YEAR? IT JUST WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED. IT’S KIND OF A MIRACLE THAT IT DID THEN — AND I WAS COMPLETELY CONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER OF WHAT I WAS DOING BUT SOMEHOW I HAD THE NERVE TO DO IT. I WOULD NOT HAVE THE NERVE TO DO IT NOW, OF COURSE.” “BECAUSE IT LOOKS EXPLOITIVE?” I SAID. “YEAH,” HE REPLIED. “EVEN AT THE TIME, IT WAS DELICATE. I WAS CONSCIOUS THEN THAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE THAT.” I SAID, “YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS, PEOPLE IN FASHION HAVE COMPLAINED THAT EVERYTHING IS TOO COMPLACENT, AND ONE EXPLANATION HAS BEEN, ‘WELL, THERE’S NOTHING TO REACT AGAINST’ — NO GREAT SOCIAL MOVEMENT, NO MASS OUTRAGE. WELL, WE HAVE THAT NOW.” “SO YOU’RE TIRED OF THE LOVE-IN IN CENTRAL PARK AND YOU WANT A MOSH PIT?” I SMILED AND WAITED. “WELL, I THINK IT’S GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE VERY YOUNG TO KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS THAT IN A NEW WAY. ALL THE DESIGNERS YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT, WE WERE A DEPARTURE FROM THE GENERATION BEFORE US. AT THIS POINT, WE ARE THE GENERATION THAT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO REJECT. THAT’S JUST WHO WE ARE. WE’VE ESTABLISHED OURSELVES. AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO VIOLENTLY REJECT US. AND THEY WILL. I’M WAITING. THEY’LL BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE IT IN A NEW WAY. WE DON’T HAVE THAT PARTICULAR SENSE OF URGENCY THAT SOMEONE WHO IS 17 DOES AND ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE 17.” EARLIER IN OUR CONVERSATION, OWENS HAD BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A BUSINESS PARTNER (IN ITALY) WHO HELPED HIM DEVELOP HIS IDEAS AND MADE SURE THE PRODUCTS WERE EXECUTED WELL AND DELIVERED ON TIME. “I’M FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THAT,” HE TOLD ME. “WITHOUT IT, I WOULD HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED.” IT ALSO HELPED THAT EDITORS AND BUYERS ACCEPTED THE SLOW PACE OF HIS EVOLUTION. NOW HE SAID, “IT DOESN’T WORK. BECAUSE THEN I HAD A MINUTE WHERE I HAD ENOUGH SPACE AROUND ME WHERE EVERYBODY COULD KIND OF REGISTER WHO I WAS. NOBODY HAS THAT SPACE AROUND THEM ANYMORE. IT’S HARD TO REGISTER ANYBODY RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THERE’S TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVING MOMENTS. “BUT, BUT, THAT IS ME SPEAKING FOR MY GENERATION, A GENERATION THAT WAS BEFORE CELL PHONES, BEFORE — DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE’D JUST WATCHED THE NEWS AND THERE WEREN’T BANNERS SCROLLING ON THE SCREEN? THE GENERATION TODAY CAN ABSORB INFORMATION OUT OF THE CORNER OF THE EYE, IN A WAY THAT WE NEVER LEARNED HOW TO. THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT OVERSATURATION OF IMAGERY, USING SYMBOLS AND HIDDEN GESTURES IN A FEED, A COMBINATION OF EMOJIS. THE OBSESSIVE SCROLLING THROUGH A FEED — “IT’S NOT EVEN TECHNOLOGY,” HE SAID WITH A LAUGH. “IT’S ALMOST EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS. IT’S JUST, LIKE, THERE’S A MAN’S FACE, THERE’S A MAN’S HAND, AND THERE IS, LIKE, A TURKEY. AND YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE STORY.” HE LAUGHED AGAIN. “IT’S TECHNOLOGY, BUT IT’S ALSO PRIMAL AND PRIMITIVE. AND THAT’S KIND OF EXCITING.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

HOWEVER PAINSTAKINGLY CURATED YOUR BOOKSHELF, HOWEVER FLATTERING YOUR LIGHT, THEY ARE LAME WHEN COMPARED WITH THE 58-YEAR-OLD DESIGNER’S BACKDROP. UNTIL YOU’RE SITTING ON A MONUMENTAL SELF-DESIGNED DAYBED IN PARIS — OR IN FRONT OF A VENETIAN SUNSET WITH AN ULTRA-RARE GEORGE MINNE SCULPTURE KNEELING NONCHALANTLY IN THE FRAME — DON’T EVEN TRY TO FLEX. ‘I THOUGHT, “LET’S GET A BIT FANCY,”’ HE SAYS IN HIS LACONIC CALIFORNIAN DRAWL, BARELY CHANGED AFTER 17 YEARS IN PARIS. OWENS HAS ALWAYS EXUDED THE SORT OF CEREBRAL CHIC FOR WHICH THE WORD ‘CHIC’ IS SIMPLY TOO MAINSTREAM. HE IS THE FASHION DESIGNERS’ FASHION DESIGNER, BEST KNOWN FOR THE SHRUNKEN LEATHER BIKER JACKETS WITH WHICH HE MADE HIS NAME IN 2002, BELOVED BY EVERYONE FROM KATE MOSS TO J-LO, JAY-Z TO T-SWIFT. BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO HIM THAN THESE. HIS FASHION SHOWS ARE SPECTACULAR, ALWAYS UNDERSCORED WITH SOCIAL COMMENTARY (HIS SPRING 2016 SHOW MEMORABLY FEATURED MODELS BOUND TOGETHER, ONE CARRYING THE OTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY — A COMMENT ON ‘WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN’, OWENS SAID AT THE TIME). AN OBSESSIVE WORK SCHEDULE AND FOCUS HAVE SEEN HIM AMASS 10 NAMESAKE STORES, A SUCCESSFUL ONLINE BUSINESS, SEVERAL DIFFUSION LINES, A FURNITURE BRAND AND A NEW COLLABORATION WITH MONCLER. NOT BAD FOR A DESIGNER WHO ONLY HELD HIS FIRST FASHION SHOW AGED 40. THAT OWENS HAS REMAINED INDEPENDENT GOES SOME WAY TO EXPLAINING HIS PRODIGIOUS AND ECLECTIC OUTPUT. ‘WE NEVER REALLY BIT OFF MORE THAN WE COULD CHEW,’ HE SHRUGS OF HIS ONGOING INDEPENDENT STATUS, A RATIONALE THAT HE SAYS WILL ALSO HELP HIS BUSINESS SURVIVE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19. ‘I MEAN, THE WORLD HAS STOPPED AND I’M SURPRISED THAT WE’RE STILL IN BUSINESS. IT’S GREAT. WE’RE PRETTY SMALL. WE DON’T HAVE A HIGH TURNOVER OF PEOPLE. IT’S A VERY TIGHT TEAM SO WE CAN PIVOT AND MANOEUVRE A LOT MORE EASILY THAN BIGGER COMPANIES.’ SEQUESTERED IN HIS MINIMALIST PARIS HOME WITH HIS WIFE OF 14 YEARS AND COLLABORATOR, THE LEGENDARY MICHÈLE LAMY, OWENS DESCRIBES LOCKDOWN AS ONE OF THE BEST TIMES OF HIS LIFE. ‘WHICH DOESN’T SOUND RIGHT,’ HE ADDS. ‘I KNOW I HAD A VERY PRIVILEGED CORNER. WE HAD A GREAT SPACE TO ISOLATE IN, AND I’M ALREADY KIND OF RECLUSIVE, SO IT WASN’T STRESSFUL FOR ME BEING OUT OF CONTACT WITH PEOPLE.’ DID HE LEARN ANY NEW SKILLS? ‘NO, NOT AT ALL,’ HE SMILES. ‘BUT I DID EAT REALLY WELL AND DO A LOT OF GYM. AND I TOOK SOME REALLY GREAT NAPS.’ HE ALSO STUDIED HISTORICAL AESTHETICS, WITH THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A MORE MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FASHION WORLD POST-COVID. HE IS UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT FASHION’S ROLE IN A CRISIS. ‘FASHION IS ABOUT COMMUNICATION. EVERYTHING YOU WEAR, EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE ABOUT HOW YOU PRESENT YOURSELF, IS A MESSAGE. IT’S A VERY PRIMITIVE, PRIMAL THING. PEOPLE HAVE ADORNED THEMSELVES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. IT’S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE AND IT’S NOT MEDICINE, BUT IT [FASHION] IS A BIG PART OF LIVING. I DON’T APOLOGISE FOR BEING A DESIGNER AT ALL.’ FORMERLY RESISTANT TO COLLABORATIONS (‘IT JUST WASN’T MY WORLD’), HE HAS FULLY EMBRACED HIS NEW ONE WITH MONCLER, WHICH IS AS ECCENTRIC AS THE MOST DISCERNING RICK OWENS FANS COULD HAVE HOPED. IN ADDITION TO A CAPSULE COLLECTION OF DOWN JACKETS, HE ALSO CUSTOMISED AN ITALIAN TOUR BUS, WITH THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF ENCOURAGING HIM TO RETURN TO HIS NATIVE CALIFORNIA. ‘MY MOM IS 87 AND ACTIVE. SHE TRAVELS TO SEE ME IN PARIS, BUT THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THE STATES WILL BECOME MORE A PART OF MY WORLD. I HADN’T BEEN BACK TO LA FOR 18 YEARS, BUT WENT BACK BECAUSE OF THIS PROJECT. THE TOUR BUS ALLOWS ME TO TRAVEL IN MY OWN AESTHETIC BUBBLE TO THE SMALL TOWN THAT MY MOM LIVES IN.’ THE BUS IS UPHOLSTERED IN DUVET, ‘BECAUSE MONCLER IS ABOUT INSULATION AND PROTECTION’. IN ADDITION TO HIS WIFE, OWENS’ PANTHEON OF MUSES INCLUDES THE MODEL AND DESIGN COLLABORATOR TYRONE DYLAN SUSMAN (‘HE’S BROUGHT A GIDDINESS AND SENSE OF PLAY’), THE ACTRESS HELENA BONHAM CARTER (‘FOR SOMEONE SO EXQUISITE TO BE SO FUNNY IS RARE’) AND THE RAPPER KANYE WEST. ‘THE CHOICES THAT HE MAKES ARE REALLY IMPRESSIVE,’ HE SAYS OF THE LATTER. ‘HE’S A CURATOR, AND THAT TAKES A TALENT. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CREATIVE DIRECTORS AS DESIGNERS, PUTTING THEM DOWN, BUT IT’S JUST PAINTING WITH A DIFFERENT BRUSH. I DON’T PUT THEM DOWN, BECAUSE BEING A CREATIVE DIRECTOR ON THAT KIND OF SCALE IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO.’ HE IS LESS EFFUSIVE ABOUT WEST’S BID FOR PRESIDENT. ‘I DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. KANYE CAN THINK IN ABSTRACTIONS, AND I DON’T KNOW IF THAT WAS REALLY SERIOUS. IT COULD BE JUST A THEORETICAL EXERCISE ON HIS PART. AND I WOULDN’T BE SURPRISED. I DON’T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE A BAD THING, HIM GOING FOR PRESIDENT. I’M NOT SURE I WOULD VOTE FOR HIM. BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT HE WOULD BE SPLITTING VOTES, FOR PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC POTENTIAL TO BE PRESIDENT AND GET RID OF TRUMP.’ AN ONLY CHILD, OWENS WAS BORN IN PORTERVILLE, AN AGRICULTURAL TOWN NOT FAR FROM LOS ANGELES: HIS FATHER, A RETIRED SOCIAL WORKER, DIED IN 2015. WHILE HE LIVES BETWEEN PARIS AND VENICE, HE ALSO LOVES LONDON, EVEN IF HE HASN’T VISITED FOR A WHILE. ‘WE ALWAYS STAY AT CLARIDGE’S. IT’S VERY HOMEY THERE. WE DO DOVER STREET MARKET FOR LUNCH, AND ALWAYS HAVE DINNER IN A CORNER BOOTH AT CLARIDGE’S. WE’RE VERY HOMESPUN.’ HOMESPUN IS NOT THE FIRST WORD THAT SPRINGS TO MIND, VIEWING OWENS IN FRONT OF HIS PANORAMIC WHITEWASHED TERRACE OVERLOOKING THE VENETIAN LIDO, SWATHED IN A DRAPEY BLACK TOP. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS TRADEMARK VEST? ‘MY TANK TOP? WELL, I CHANGED. NOW MY CHEST IS SO GOOD THAT I’VE BEEN DOING THIS,’ HE SAYS, THEATRICALLY SLIPPING HIS TOP TO THE SIDE TO REVEAL A PERFECTLY HONED PEC. ‘I’M NOT GONNA LOOK LIKE THIS FOREVER. I’M GONNA MILK THIS MOMENT.’ I ASK HIM HOW THE REST OF US CAN ACHIEVE A TONED, RICK OWENS ARM. ‘OH, YOU WORK OUT EVERY DAY. IT’S LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH. IT’S JUST ABOUT CONSISTENCY.’ DOES HE HAVE A SPECIFIC BEAUTY ROUTINE? ‘I GET MY HAIR STRAIGHTENED. I DYE MY EYEBROWS WHEN I DYE MY HAIR. OTHER THAN THAT, CHAPSTICK, A LOT OF MOISTURISER AND THAT’S IT. I DON’T HAVE A LOT OF PRODUCTS IN MY BATHROOM.’ DESPITE THIS BEING A ZOOM INTERVIEW, I’D STILL LIKE TO TRY TO ENGAGE MY SENSES FROM BEHIND THE HARSH FLAT PRISMS OF OUR COMPUTER SCREENS, SO I ASK WHAT HE SMELLS LIKE. ‘LIKE AĒSOP PRODUCTS. I HAVE MY HAIR CHEMICALLY STRAIGHTENED, WHICH WRECKS IT. IT’S GETTING PRETTY THIN AND I’M DEVELOPING A BALD SPOT AND I’M THINKING, SHOULD I LET IT GO WHITE? BUT I’M JUST NOT READY.’ NOR IS HE READY TO GIVE UP ON CATWALK SHOWS, BELIEVING THE FASHION INDUSTRY WOULD BE A POORER PLACE WITHOUT THEM. ‘I THINK THEY’RE JUST GOING TO EVOLVE. RUNWAY SHOWS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HAVE EXISTED FOREVER. CHURCH IS A RUNWAY SHOW. MEDIEVAL PAGEANTS WERE RUNWAY SHOWS. ROCK CONCERTS ARE RUNWAY SHOWS. THEY’RE ABOUT PEOPLE RUBBING SHOULDERS. THEY’LL ALWAYS HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT HUMANS NEED. HUMANS NEED TO CONNECT AND SHARE A TRANSCENDENT MOMENT TOGETHER.’ HAPPILY FOR THE FASHION WORLD, OWENS WILL STILL BE ON HAND, IMBUING EACH SEASON WITH HIS PARTICULAR BRAND OF MAGIC.

OWENS HAS OFTEN CONFESSED TO NOT SPEAKING FRENCH DESPITE SHOWING THERE SINCE 2003, AND YET HE’D MASTERED ITALIAN? HE SMILED, SIPPED HIS ACQUA FRIZZANTE, AND SAID: “ITALY IS WHERE I CREATE, AND PARIS IS WHERE I AM JUDGED.” THIS SEASON OWENS SHOWED OUTSIDE OF PARIS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER. IT WAS A PRESENTATION THAT WAS “REDUCTIVE,” AS HE PUT IT, IN AT LEAST TWO SENSES. HIS “SKELETON” CREW OF AROUND 20 COLLEAGUES AND 20-ISH MODELS SHOWED A LIVESTREAMED COLLECTION TO A PHYSICALLY THERE AUDIENCE OF JUST TWO (ANGELO FLACCAVENTO, FORMERLY OF THIS PARISH, AND MYSELF), IN PART AS PRAGMATIC NEGOTIATION WITH LIFE IN THE TIMES OF CORONAVIRUS: “IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE ABLE TO ORCHESTRATE SOMETHING WITH FEWER INSTRUMENTS.” AND YET THIS ACT OF PROTECTION WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY ALSO ONE OF EXPOSURE—FOR BY CHOOSING TO INVITE US HERE TO THE LIDO DI VENEZIA, A PLACE HE THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE YEAR CALLS HOME, OWENS WAS OPENING UP. AS HE SAID IN AN OUTTAKE OF THE FILMED INTERVIEW I WAS HERE TO CONDUCT FOR GOOD MORNING VOGUE: “THERE IS A RECLUSIVENESS, AN ISOLATION THAT I’VE FOUND HERE THAT APPEALS TO ME. THE BEACH NEVER BECOMES CROWDED. I’VE HAD THE SAME CABANA FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS…AND I GO EVERY MORNING WITH MY COFFEE AND I HAVE MY COMPUTER AND I JUST WORK THERE ALL DAY. I JUMP IN THE SEA AND THEN I WORK AND THEN I JUMP THE SEA.… AND THAT’S MY SUMMER. AND IN RECENT CIRCUMSTANCES I’VE STAYED HERE EVEN MORE: PARIS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT. AND I DECIDED TO REALLY BUCKLE DOWN AND STAY IN ITALY AND KIND OF FOCUS AND BE WITH THE FACTORY MORE…THE MINUTE THE FACTORY WAS ABLE TO REOPEN, I CAME RIGHT AWAY.” THAT FACTORY IS IN CONCORDIA, MODENA, AROUND A THREE-HOUR DRIVE FROM HERE—AND WHERE OWENS ALSO HAS AN APARTMENT (PLUS AN OWENSCORP CAFETERIA) TO BASE HIMSELF IN DURING PERIODS OF SUSTAINED FOCUS ON PRODUCTION. FOR THIS SHOW, THOUGH, OWENS HAD HIS TEAM MAKE THE SHORT HOP BACK TO THE LIDO TO PRESENT HIS COLLECTION AGAINST THE RATIONALIST ARCHITECTURE OF ITS PALAZZO DEL CASINÒ. AESTHETICALLY, THIS BUILDING’S FACADE IS A VENETIAN COUSIN OF THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, OWENS’S USUAL PARISIAN VENUE (WHICH WAS THIS SEASON SNAPPED UP IN HIS ABSENCE BY CHLOÉ). UNLIKE THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, THE CASINÒ, A LITTLE LIKE OWENS HIMSELF, IS A STRUCTURE WHOSE MONUMENTALLY IMPOSING EXTERIOR—“GRAPHIC SEVERITY,” AS HE PUTS IT—BELIES AN INTERIOR MARKED BY HUMOR AND ABUNDANCE: “I DIDN’T REALIZE IT WAS GOING TO BE SO EXTRAVAGANT. THERE’S MURALS AND THERE’S CRAZY MURANO CHANDELIERS, AND THE PROPORTIONS ARE EXTREME…” ALL OF THE FITTINGS AND LAST-MINUTE PREP WORK, AS WELL AS THE GOOD MORNING VOGUE INTERVIEW, TOOK PLACE ABOUT 100 METERS DOWN THE ROAD, IN THE HOTEL EXCELSIOR. THIS IS WHERE OWENS FIRST STAYED WHEN HE BECAME A REGULAR HERE. EVEN NOW, SETTLED AS HE IS IN HIS NEARBY APARTMENT, HE MAINTAINS THAT EXCELSIOR-OPERATED CABANA (WHICH IS ONE AMONG HUNDREDS BEING DISMANTLED ALONG THE BEACH TO MARK THE VERY END OF SUMMER). BUILT IN 1908, THE EXCELSIOR IS A MOORISH FANTASY WHOSE STARTING POINT WAS THE TRUE VENETIAN ARTICULATIONS OF THAT ARABIAN STYLE, INCLUDING MOST FAMOUSLY OF ALL THE DOGE’S PALACE: THIS MORE-ISH UPDATE WAS BUILT AS A DISNEY-FIED PLEASURE PALACE FOR THE SYBARITES OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY. “ITS LEGEND HAS ALWAYS CAPTIVATED ME,” SAID OWENS, WHO CITED NIJINSKY DANCING ON THE BEACH HERE AS ONE FAVORITE POINT OF REFERENCE. TODAY BOTH THE LIDO AND THE EXCELSIOR ARE FAMED FOR PLAYING HOST TO THE VENICE FILM FESTIVAL, BUT OUTSIDE OF SEASON AND FESTIVAL TIME THE HOTEL AND ITS SURROUNDINGS ARE QUIET. THE BEACHSIDE RESTAURANT WHERE OWENS FLEXES HIS ITALIAN IS THE ONLY ONE OPEN, AND ONLY REMAINS SO BECAUSE HE ASKED ITS OWNERS TO KEEP HIS TEAM IN VICTUALS DURING THE RUN-UP TO THE SHOW. REFERENCE-WISE, THE LIDO IS PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR ITS KEY ROLE IN THOMAS MANN’S DEATH IN VENICE. “IT ALWAYS STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME,” SAID OWENS, WHO ADDED THAT THE BOOK (AND FILM) “IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I MOVED TO THE LIDO.” OWENS ADDED: “HERE’S THIS ASCETIC CREATOR WHO RETREATS TO THE LIDO BECAUSE HE’S GOT WRITER’S BLOCK. HE SEES A YOUTH AND HE IS INSPIRED AND EUPHORIC. AND THEN GRADUALLY, THAT TURNS INTO SOME KIND OF OBSESSION…. BUT I THINK THE PART THAT RESONATES WITH ME IS THE PART ABOUT AGING, AND THAT’S A BIG PART OF THE STORYLINE. [HE’S] RECOGNIZING A MOMENT IN THIS YOUTH THAT HE MISSES, THAT HE MISSES DEEPLY AND PROFOUNDLY, AND MAYBE WHICH HE NEVER EVEN EXPERIENCED. AND HE’S SEEING THAT THIS GOLDEN MOMENT IS OUT OF REACH, AND THAT HE’LL NEVER EVER EXPERIENCE OR CAPTURE IT, AND IT TURNS INTO A DEGRADING EXPERIENCE. SO YOU HAVE THIS FULL ARC OF EUPHORIA AND INSPIRATION AND STIMULATION THAT GRADUALLY CORRUPTS UNTIL IT BECOMES THIS TORTURE.” WHEN NOT LURKING IN MY PADDED ROOM IN THE EXCELSIOR, ZOOMING OTHER DESIGNERS, AND WATCHING THE USUALLY PASSENGER-LESS WATER TAXI SHUTTLE ARRIVE ON THE PONTOON BELOW FROM VENICE EVERY 20 MINUTES, THERE IS AMPLE TIME TO EXPLORE THE IMMEDIATE AREA. HERE, THE ISLAND IS ONLY TWO BLOCKS WIDE. IT’S THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE YOU TURN ONE CORNER AND SEE A PERSON YOU WALKED PAST TWO MINUTES AGO, AND TWO MINUTES BEFORE THAT. THE THWACK OF RACKET AGAINST BALL FROM THE VENICE TENNIS CLUB COMPETES WITH THE “OOF, OOF, OOF” OF JEFF JUDD’S REMIX OF DONNA SUMMER’S “I FEEL LOVE,” WHICH TEAM OWENS IS SOUND CHECKING BY THE CASINÒ. IT’S A MIX THAT NEVER REACHES A CLIMAX—A HIGHLY STRUNG CACOPHONY OF INDUSTRIAL ANTICIPATION—AND WHICH OWENS SAID JUDD MADE YEARS AGO, AND WHICH HE HAS BEEN WAITING TO USE AT A SHOW. “BECAUSE IT JUST FELT LIKE THE GREATEST INDULGENCE TO BE ABLE TO POUND IT OUT FROM A RATIONALIST BUILDING IN THE LIDO…I ASKED THE SOUND GUY, ‘WILL THEY BE ABLE TO HEAR THIS SONG IN PIAZZA SAN MARCO?’ AND HE ASSURED ME THAT YES, THEY WILL.” PARTS OF THE BEACH—THE BEACH WHERE MANN’S ASCHENBACH FULFILLS THE NOVEL’S TITLE—SEEM TO BE CONSTITUTED ENTIRELY OF DEAD SHELLS. THEY CRUNCH UNDERFOOT. THE WATER IS FLAT AND LIMPID, AND THERE IS NO VISIBLE LINE OF HORIZON WHERE IT MEETS THE SKY. THE AIR IS SALTY, EVEN A LITTLE DANK, AND SEAGULLS BICKER AS DIGGERS TRUNDLE UP AND DOWN DISMANTLING CABANAS. IN DEATH IN VENICE MANN DESCRIBES “THE LIMBO BETWEEN CREATION AND DECAY,” AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF WHY ASCHENBACH IS SO DRAWN TO THIS PLACE COULD AS EASILY BE PROJECTED ONTO OWENS. AS MANN PUTS IT: “HIS LOVE OF THE SEA HAD PROFOUND ROOTS: THE HARDWORKING ARTIST’S DESIRE TO REST, HIS LONGING TO GET AWAY FROM THE DEMANDING DIVERSITY OF PHENOMENA AND TAKE SHELTER IN THE BOSOM OF SIMPLICITY AND IMMENSITY; A FORBIDDEN PENCHANT THAT WAS ENTIRELY ANTITHETICAL TO HIS MISSION AND, FOR THAT VERY REASON, SEDUCTIVE—A PROCLIVITY FOR THE UNORGANIZED, THE IMMEASURABLE, THE ETERNAL: FOR NOTHINGNESS.” OF NOTHINGNESS, OWENS OBSERVED: “I’M NOT ONE OF THE PESSIMISTS WHO THINKS THAT WE’RE GOING TO DESTROY THE PLANET. I FEEL LIKE IT’S GOING TO EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING ELSE, AND I THINK IT WOULD BE ARROGANT OF US TO THINK THAT WE HAVE THAT POWER…I THINK DEATH IS PART OF ALL OF OUR LIVES AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING ELSE. ANYWAY, THAT’S MY FATALISTIC ATTITUDE.” THE SHOW STARTED FIVE MINUTES AFTER ITS ADVERTISED START TIME. THE MODELS EACH HAD TWO CHANGES, WHICH SAW THEM BECOMING GRADUALLY MORE CLOTHED: THERE IS NO WAY THAT OWENS’S “WADER” BOOTS, PLATFORMED THIGH-HIGHS PRESENTED AS A COPING MECHANISM FOR THE PHLEGETHON (RIVER TO HELL) AFTER WHICH THE COLLECTION IS NAMED, CAN BE CHANGED MID-LIVESTREAM. MICHÈLE LAMY WATCHED ON AS TYRONE DYLAN SUSMAN AND THE REST OF THIS PARED-DOWN TEAM WORKED THROUGH THE RACK, REPLENISHING THE LOOKS AS THE MODELS RETURNED FROM THEIR FIERCE CIRCUITS OF THE PIAZZA. BEHIND THE ROPE, THAT STRAGGLE OF SPECTATORS INCLUDED AN ELDERLY COUPLE IN PASTEL PUFFA JACKETS, WITH A POODLE: OWENS LATER SAID THEY ARE HIS DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBORS. LIGHTS PULSED FROM INSIDE THE PALACE. A DRONE MOANED ABOVE. JUDD’S MIX BUILT AND BUILT TO THE CRESCENDO IT WOULD NEVER REACH. FOLLOWING PHLEGETHON THERE WAS A DINNER BACK AT THE EXCELSIOR. IT WAS A HOUSE DINNER, AND EVERYONE WORE OWENS, APART FROM FLACCAVENTO (IN RICK-ADMIRED ISSEY MIYAKE AND VALENTINO SHOES) AND ME (IN CHINOS, A KISS TOUR T-SHIRT, AND NEW BALANCES). AS AN ENSEMBLE, THE TEAM LOOKED FEARSOMELY OWENS-ISH, WHILE THE ATMOSPHERE THEY CREATED WAS THE OPPOSITE OF FIERCE. ONE ASSISTANT WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE COMPANY FOR 22 YEARS RECEIVED A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY CAKE TO GREAT APPLAUSE. ANOTHER COLLEAGUE CRIED, HAPPILY, AS SPEECHES WERE MADE MARKING HIS 10 YEARS WITH THE TEAM. MOST OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO REVOLVE AROUND FAMILY; WOULD THE DIGITAL DIRECTOR GET HOME TO AUSTRALIA IN TIME FOR THE BIRTH OF HIS SECOND CHILD? WHEN WAS SO-AND-SO GOING TO SETTLE DOWN AND HAVE HER FIRST? OWENS SHOWED OFF CUTE-AS-PIE PICTURES OF HIS AND MICHÈLE’S GRANDDAUGHTER. SHORTLY AFTERWARD, HIS MOTHER, CONNIE, FACETIMED, AND OWENS TOOK HER ON A VIRTUAL TOUR OF THE TABLES TO SAY HELLO TO EVERYONE. “DURING QUARANTINE,” SAID OWENS: “I NOTICED THAT SPEAKING TO A LOT OF FRIENDS, A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS HAD EVOLVED. OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOVED ONES DEEPENED, AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE INESSENTIAL KIND OF FELL AWAY. EVERYBODY WAS ABLE TO HAVE A MINUTE TO DEFINE WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM, WHICH WAS MAYBE A SILVER LINING TO THAT CLOUD.” OWENS SLIPPED OUT FROM DINNER AFTER THAT BIRTHDAY CAKE AND HEADED DOWN THE ROAD TO HIS APARTMENT. OTHERS TRICKLED AWAY TOO. FOR A FEW HARDY SOULS, HOWEVER, PHLEGETHON LED TO A MARATHON WINE-ATHON. THERE WAS DANCING, TO MUSIC YOU REALLY WOULDN’T EXPECT—A SORT OF REGGAETON VERSUS EURO CHEESE SOUND CLASH—AND WILD TALK OF MIDNIGHT SWIMMING, AND MAYBE MORE DANCING DOWN ON THE BEACH. AT SOME POINT I SWAPPED MY NEW BALANCES FOR A PAIR OF TYRONE’S KISS COLLECTION PLATFORMS (HE WAS IN WADERS) AND DISCOVERED THAT THEY ARE A) A DREAM TO WALK IN AND B) REALLY GREAT FOR STRETCHING OUT YOUR LOWER BACK. OUT ABOVE THE OCEAN A FAT, FULL MOON HUNG HIGH IN THE INKY SKY.

CHANEL. VERSACE. DIOR. AND THEN THERE’S RICK. SINCE LAUNCHING HIS EPONYMOUS LINE IN 1994, RICK OWENS, ONE OF THE LAST GREAT AMERICAN INDEPENDENT DESIGNERS, HAS BROKEN FROM TRADITION BY CULTIVATING THE UNLIKELIEST PERSONA: A BLACK-LEATHER-CLAD, BRÂNCUȘI-AND-BEUYS–SUMMONING, BRUTALIST-LOVING NECROMANCER WHO IS NOT ONLY APPROACHABLE, BUT EXUBERANT; A MAD GENIUS OF SOPHISTICATED, AREA 51–INFLECTED DRAPING WHO CALLS HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, “HUN”; A DARK LORD NEXT DOOR. AT 57, AFTER NEARLY TWO DECADES IN PARIS, THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE RETURNED TO LOS ANGELES AS PART OF A COLLABORATIVE EXPERIMENT WITH THE ITALIAN LABEL MONCLER. OWENS AND LAMY STEPPED OFF THE PLANE AT LAX AND ONTO A SOUPED-UP, MATTE-BLACK BUS THAT FERRIED THEM TO MICHAEL HEIZER’S RANCH IN NEVADA SO THEY COULD MARVEL AT “CITY,” A LAND-ART PIECE 48 YEARS IN THE MAKING. THE CUSTOM VEHICLE THAT DROVE THEM THERE—OUTFITTED WITH PADDED WALLS AND MONCLER DUVETS, ALL RENDERED IN THE DESIGNER’S PREFERRED PALETTE OF HUSHED GRAYS—IS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE, ALTHOUGH, OWENS SAYS, “OF COURSE, IT’S EXPENSIVE.” LESS EXPENSIVE ARE THE CLOTHES THAT MONCLER MADE FOR THEM TO WEAR ON THE TRIP, EXTRATERRESTRIAL DOWN-FILLED INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING OWENS SILHOUETTES. TO COMMEMORATE THE PROJECT, OWENS GOT ON THE PHONE WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROAD. THEY CALL HER MILEY. —NICK HARAMIS RICK OWENS: WHERE ARE YOU? MILEY CYRUS: I’M CALLING YOU FROM MY BED. OWENS: YOU’RE CALLING ME FROM YOUR BED? CYRUS: WELL, ACTUALLY, I’M CALLING YOU FROM SOMEONE ELSE’S BED. OWENS: IS THERE A STORY BEHIND THAT? CYRUS: THERE IS A STORY BEHIND IT. WE’VE BEEN WORKING ON A METALLICA COVER ALBUM AND I’M HERE WORKING ON THAT. WE’RE SO LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUR ART DURING ALL OF THIS. AT FIRST, IT FELT UNINSPIRING AND NOW I’VE BEEN TOTALLY IGNITED. HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING THE SAME WAY? OWENS: I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK IN TIMES OF HARDSHIP, YOU HAVE TO STEP UP YOUR GAME AND FIGHT BACK, AND CREATING IS THE STRONGEST WAY TO DO THAT. I’M COMPLETELY INVIGORATED AND ENERGIZED. CYRUS: ME F CKING TOO. WHO ARE YOUR TOP-THREE FAVORITE ROCK STARS? OWENS: [DAVID] BOWIE, OF COURSE. THERE WAS A PERIOD WHEN ALL I LISTENED TO WAS MOTÖRHEAD, SO LEMMY [KILMISTER]. AND IGGY POP. CYRUS: PEOPLE ASK ME WHO I’VE STUDIED FOR MY MOVEMENT ON STAGE, AND I ALWAYS SAY IGGY POP. OWENS: HE INSPIRES ME NEVER TO WEAR A SHIRT. I JUST HAVE TO SAY, THAT PERFORMANCE YOU DID WITH WAYNE COYNE AT THE 2014 BILLBOARD MUSIC AWARDS, THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS I’VE EVER SEEN. IT WAS JUST SO DELIRIOUS AND RECKLESS. CYRUS: I HAVE SUCH A HEALTHY AND SEXY RELATIONSHIP WITH RECKLESSNESS RIGHT NOW. I CAN SAY YES TO ANYTHING. IT WOULD TAKE SOMETHING REALLY F CKING CRAZY FOR ME TO SAY NO. WAYNE REALLY OPENED THAT DOOR FOR ME, BECAUSE I WAS ON THE BANGERZ TOUR AT THAT TIME, WHERE I WAS TRAVELING THE WORLD. YOUR LEVELS OF FULFILLMENT AND DEPRESSION ARE SO DRASTIC, BECAUSE YOU’VE GOT THAT TWO HOURS WHERE YOU’RE FULLY CAPTIVATED AND REACHING YOUR FULLEST POTENTIAL, AND THEN WHEN YOU COME DOWN FROM IT, IT’S SO HARD. HAVING HIM AND HAVING THAT PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR ME. OWENS: WHEN YOU’RE ON TOUR, ARE YOU IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL SPACE? ARE YOU ON A TOUR BUS OR FLYING PRIVATE? CYRUS: THEY ALWAYS GET HOTEL ROOMS AND I NEVER STAY IN THEM. I ALWAYS STAY ON MY BUS. I MAKE IT MY ZONE AND DO A LOT OF DRAWING AND PAINTING. I STARTED WORKING ON SCULPTURE, WHICH IS HILARIOUS TO DO IN A MOVING VEHICLE. OWENS: YOU ENDED UP CUSTOMIZING YOUR ENVIRONMENT INSIDE THE BUS? CYRUS: YEAH. THE THING THAT I LIKED ABOUT SCULPTURE WAS MAKING ART OUT OF THINGS THAT DIDN’T MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYONE ELSE, THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED TRASH. I THINK THAT CAME FROM MY MOM. SHE WAS ADOPTED AND, IN A SENSE, GIVEN AWAY, AND SHE DIDN’T FEEL A LOT OF VALUE. BUT I TOTALLY WORSHIP HER. OWENS: THAT’S A REALLY TENDER CREATIVE EXPRESSION. BUT WHEN YOU PERFORM, IT’S MORE OF A POWERFUL BLAST. YOUR SONGS ARE TENDER, BUT YOUR PERFORMANCES ARE STRONG. CYRUS: I USUALLY FEEL PRETTY BOTTLED-UP, AND PERFORMING IS THE ONLY TIME I GET TO BE MYSELF IN MY FULLEST FORM. IT’S A F CKING ADDICTION, BECAUSE WHEN I’M NOT DOING IT, I JUST WISH THAT I WAS. OWENS: YOU’RE COMMUNICATING, AND EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET WANTS TO COMMUNICATE, SO IT’S NOT AN ADDICTION. AND YOU’VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE LISTENED TO, WHICH IS THE MOST SATISFYING THING IN THE WORLD. CYRUS: THIS IS THE LONGEST I’VE EVER GONE WITHOUT BEING ON THE ROAD. I’VE BEEN TOURING FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS, AND THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT I HAVEN’T DONE IT. DOLLY PARTON, WHO’S MY GODMOTHER, HAS BEEN TOURING FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SHE HASN’T BEEN ON THE ROAD. OWENS: OKAY, WAIT. YOUR GODMOTHER IS DOLLY PARTON? CYRUS: YEAH. SHE’S THE BEST. SHE’S THE MOST WICKEDLY CREATIVE PERSON. SHE STARTED MAKING A CHRISTMAS ALBUM IN JANUARY BECAUSE SHE WAS SO F CKING BORED IN ALL OF THIS. OWENS: THE ALBUM SHE DID WITH LINDA RONSTADT AND EMMYLOU HARRIS? THANK GOD THAT HAPPENED. CYRUS: THE TRIO! SPEAKING OF COLLABORATION, HOW DID THIS PROJECT WITH MONCLER HAPPEN? HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO TO GET IN BED WITH? OWENS: I’VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE COLLAB SITUATION. UNDER THE WORST CIRCUMSTANCES, IT’S AN OBVIOUS MARKETING GIMMICK. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING REALLY CREATIVE, EXTRAVAGANT, KIND OF RECKLESS THINGS. BESIDES THAT, I’VE OPENED UP A LOT RECENTLY, BECAUSE I’VE BEEN RECLUSIVE AND INSULATED LONG ENOUGH. IT’S A GREAT WAY TO GET OUT OF MY LITTLE SHELL. BUT I ONLY AGREED TO DO IT BECAUSE I WANTED A TOUR BUS. I WANTED TO DO AN INSULATED TOUR BUS THAT WAS A PURE AESTHETIC EXPRESSION, LIKE A SPACE CAPSULE OR A SUBMARINE THAT WOULD GET ME FROM POINT A TO POINT B IN THE STATES. I WAS INVITED TO SEE ONE OF MICHAEL HEIZER’S INSTALLATIONS IN NEVADA, WHICH WAS THE PERFECT EXCUSE TO FLY TO THE STATES. I TOLD MONCLER, “I’LL GET IN THIS TOUR BUS IN L.A., AND WE’LL DRIVE THROUGH THE DESERT AND GO TO THIS INSTALLATION, AND IT’LL BE AN ART ORGY. THE TOUR BUS WILL BE A PIECE OF ART, AND I’M GOING TO MAKE THESE CLOTHES THAT MATCH THE TOUR BUS. THEN WE’RE GOING TO TURN THE TOUR BUS AROUND AND GET BACK ON THE AIRPLANE AND LEAVE. MONCLER IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND THAT, BECAUSE THAT’S THE KIND OF COMPANY YOU ARE.” AND THEY DID. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN ART AND PERFORMANCE. I’M NOT SAYING THIS WAS PERFORMANCE ART, BUT THAT WAS VERY MUCH ON MY MIND WHEN I WAS DOING IT. CYRUS: I GREW UP ON A TOUR BUS. I WENT WITH MY DAD EVERYWHERE. HE TURNED IT INTO A PLAYHOUSE FOR US. THEY HAD SOME STAIRS YOU COULD GO DOWN TO GET UNDER THE BUS, WHERE THE LUGGAGE WOULD BE, AND HE CREATED A PLACE FOR ME AND MY BROTHER TO GO AND PLAY AND IMAGINE AND DREAM. WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT BEING ON THE TOUR BUS? WHY ARE YOU SO FASCINATED WITH IT? OWENS: BEING ABLE TO ISOLATE YOURSELF WHILE YOU’RE TRAVELING THROUGH SOME KIND OF WILDERNESS APPEALED TO ME. THERE’S ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT BEING VERY CREATIVE WHILE YOU’RE TRAVELING, BECAUSE THERE’S A SENSE OF MOMENTUM THAT IS STIMULATING. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE RELIEVED OF DAY-TO-DAY RESPONSIBILITIES GIVES YOU SPACE TO LET SOMETHING HAPPEN IN YOUR BRAIN. I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I’M GOING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING WHEN I TRAVEL. DOES THAT HAPPEN TO YOU? CYRUS: OH, YEAH. I ALWAYS WRITE SONGS IN THE CAR. I’VE READ A LOT ABOUT HEALING THROUGH MOVEMENT, BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO SIT IN THEIR FEELINGS, AND I’M JUST NOT THAT PERSON. I LIKE TO MOVE THROUGH THEM. WHAT DID YOU LEARN ABOUT AMERICA ON YOUR TRIP? OWENS: NOT A THING. I PROBABLY WASN’T ASKING ANY QUESTIONS. I WASN’T BEING VERY PERCEPTIVE. I WAS JUST IN MY LITTLE BUBBLE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, KIND OF LIVING IN MY OWN LITTLE WORLD. CYRUS: YOU’RE FROM THE WEST COAST, BUT YOU HADN’T BEEN BACK SINCE YOU MOVED TO EUROPE. WHY DID YOU FEEL LIKE NOW WAS THE RIGHT TIME? OWENS: I HADN’T BEEN BACK TO LOS ANGELES IN 18 YEARS. I WAS IN NO GREAT RUSH BECAUSE I WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME IN EUROPE, AND THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER PLACES TO GO. AND I SUSPECT THAT THERE WAS A PART OF ME THAT DIDN’T WANT TO RETURN TO A PLACE WHERE I HADN’T FELT FULLY DEVELOPED—I DIDN’T WANT TO BE REMINDED OF THAT TIME. BUT THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING VERY FULFILLING ABOUT GOING BACK AND FEELING MORE POWERFUL THAN I DID THEN. I FELT A LITTLE SILLY ENJOYING THAT SO MUCH, BUT I JUST RELAXED INTO IT AND IT ENDED UP BEING REALLY, REALLY NICE. I’LL PROBABLY GO BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE OFTEN NOW. CYRUS: WHERE DID YOU STOP DURING THE TRIP? OWENS: WELL, IT WAS PRETTY QUICK. IT WAS ONLY, LIKE, THREE DAYS. WE HAD TO STOP IN LAS VEGAS, AND THEN WE STAYED AT A RANCH IN NEVADA. WE WENT TO AREA 51, AND THEN WE WENT TO LOS ANGELES FOR TWO DAYS AND I HAD MY 57TH BIRTHDAY PARTY THERE. CYRUS: SPEAKING OF AREA 51, DO YOU BELIEVE IN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS? OWENS: I DON’T REALLY, BUT IT SEEMS A LITTLE ARROGANT TO ASSUME THERE’S NOBODY ELSE BUT US. CYRUS: THAT’S WHAT I F CKING THINK! OWENS: I HAVEN’T LOOKED INTO IT. HAVE YOU? CYRUS: I HAD AN EXPERIENCE, ACTUALLY. I WAS DRIVING THROUGH SAN BERNARDINO WITH MY FRIEND, AND I GOT CHASED DOWN BY SOME SORT OF UFO. I’M PRETTY SURE ABOUT WHAT I SAW, BUT I’D ALSO BOUGHT WEED WAX FROM A GUY IN A VAN IN FRONT OF A TACO SHOP, SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE WEED WAX. BUT THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS A FLYING SNOWPLOW. IT HAD THIS BIG PLOW IN THE FRONT OF IT AND WAS GLOWING YELLOW. I DID SEE IT FLYING, AND MY FRIEND SAW IT, TOO. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER CARS ON THE ROAD AND THEY ALSO STOPPED TO LOOK, SO I THINK WHAT I SAW WAS REAL. OWENS: WELL, I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THAT. I HAVEN’T SEEN SHIT. CYRUS: I WAS SHAKEN FOR, LIKE, FIVE DAYS. IT F CKED ME UP. OWENS: IT DISTURBED YOU? CYRUS: I COULDN’T REALLY LOOK AT THE SKY THE SAME. I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT COME BACK. OWENS: SO YOU FELT THREATENED? CYRUS: I DIDN’T FEEL THREATENED AT ALL, ACTUALLY, BUT I DID SEE A BEING SITTING IN THE FRONT OF THE FLYING OBJECT. IT LOOKED AT ME AND WE MADE EYE CONTACT, AND I THINK THAT’S WHAT REALLY SHOOK ME, LOOKING INTO THE EYES OF SOMETHING THAT I COULDN’T QUITE WRAP MY HEAD AROUND. BUT YOU’RE SO RIGHT TO SAY THAT IT’S A FORM OF NARCISSISM TO THINK THAT WE’RE THE ONLY THINGS THAT COULD BE IN THIS VAST UNIVERSE. OWENS: TO CONFRONT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE VERY DISORIENTING BECAUSE IT REALLY SHAKES UP EVERYTHING; LIKE, THE WHOLE SYSTEM. I’LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I SEE MY FIRST UFO.

THERE WERE THE PANTLESS MEN, THE PUNK BAND SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING, THE BUBBLE-TOPIA IN HOMAGE TO HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE, AND THE OLDEN DAYS OF DRAGGY HEMMED WAIFS PARADING THROUGH PARIS. JUST THREE WEEKS AGO HE CARTED HIS TEAM TO VENICE’S LIDO FOR A TOTALLY TWISTED ROMP THROUGH HELL, TINGED WITH SOME DEATH IN VENICE OBSESSIONS AND A BIT OF PEPTO-PINK LIBERATION. THE LONGER YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE HARDER IT IS TO CHOOSE. STILL, WHEN WE BEGAN SPEAKING WITH OWENS AND HIS TEAM ABOUT A BEST SHOW EVER VIDEO FOR VOGUE RUNWAY’S ONGOING SERIES, HIS SPRING 2016 WOMENSWEAR SHOW CAME TO THE FORE. TITLED CYCLOPS, THE SHOW WAS MEMORABLE FOR ITS HUMAN ARCHITECTURE: AFTER FOUR AUSTERELY BODY-CONSCIOUS LOOKS A MODEL CAME OUT ONTO THE RUNWAY WITH ANOTHER MODEL STRAPPED TO HER BACK. SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A DOZEN OTHER FUSED-TOGETHER WOMEN, SOME BACK-TO-FRONT, OTHERS UPSIDE DOWN. THE INITIAL REFERENCE WAS LEIGH BOWERY AND HIS WIFE, NICOLA BATEMAN, WOVEN TOGETHER INTO A TOPSY-TURVY POSE AND PHOTOGRAPHED BY ANNIE LEIBOVITZ, BUT IT QUICKLY EVOLVED INTO A LARGER STATEMENT ABOUT WOMANNESS. “THERE WERE REFERENCES TO BIRTHING, REFERENCES TO AGING, THE CYCLE OF LIFE,” OWENS SAYS. “THEN, YOU KNOW, I STUCK A COUPLE OF HIGH HEELS ON THE GIRLS BEING CARRIED JUST BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY.” “I REMEMBER THERE WAS ONE REVIEW THAT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HOW IT WAS DIFFICULT SEEING THE STRAIN ON THE WOMEN’S FACES WHO WERE BEING HELD UPSIDE DOWN, BUT THESE WERE ATHLETES. I DIDN’T MAKE OUR MODEL COMMUNITY DO THIS,” HE CONTINUES. “AND THAT STRAIN IS PART OF THE BURDEN OF CARRYING PEOPLE AND BEING PART OF A COMMUNITY. I THINK I’M VERY SATISFIED WITH THAT ELEMENT OF STRAIN.” HELD IN THE PALAIS DE TOKYO ON OCTOBER 2, 2015, THE SHOW WAS ALSO A TURNING POINT IN FASHION AT LARGE. SPECTACLE SHOWS WERE BECOMING THE NORM FROM THE MEGALITHIC BRANDS AND THE IDEA OF “STUNT CASTING” WAS REACHING AN APEX. OWENS NEVER REALLY DEALT IN THAT—WELL, IF HE DID HE DID IT IN HIS OWN WAY, REFRACTING FASHION’S GROWING THEATRICALITY WITH A SENSITIVITY AND ARTFULNESS. “THIS WAS THEATER, THIS WAS POETRY, THIS WAS A STATEMENT,” SAYS ESKA, WHO PERFORMED A RENDITION OF “THIS LAND” BY JAMES LAVELLE AT THE SPRING 2016 SHOW. FOR THOSE WHO WERE THERE, THE SIMPLE BUT PROVOCATIVE GESTURE OF FUSED-TOGETHER WOMEN’S BODIES REMAINS POIGNANT. “BEING AT RICK’S SHOWS WHEN HE CREATES MOMENTS LIKE THESE, YOU KNOW YOU’RE A PART OF HISTORY,” SAYS PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVITT, WHO HAS WORKED WITH OWENS SINCE 2014. “THIS IS THE KIND OF SHOW THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE CLAMORING TO SEE RICK AFTERWARDS WITH SO MANY QUESTIONS: WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?” RECALLS NICOLE PHELPS, VOGUE RUNWAY’S GLOBAL DIRECTOR. “IT FELT LIKE A TRIBUTE TO WOMEN’S STRENGTH, AND AS A WOMAN IT WAS HARD NOT TO WALK AWAY AND FEEL EMPOWERED AND FULL OF OPTIMISM AND JOY. I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL THAT’S HOW I TEND TO FEEL WHEN I LEAVE A RICK OWENS SHOW.” LIKE WE SAID—HARD TO CHOOSE A FAVORITE. HERE, OWENS, ESKA, LEVITT, PHELPS, AND OTHERS REMEMBER THE POWER OF RICK’S WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN.

INDEED, ALTHOUGH HE IS PARTIAL TO PLATFORM BOOTS FOR STROLLING AROUND PARIS AND TAKING HIS RUNWAY BOW, OWENS HAS BECOME A GURU FOR SNEAKERHEADS AND HYPE BEASTS, WHO COLLECT HIS GEOBASKETS AND RUNNERS AND HAVE GONE BANANAS FOR HIS COLLABORATIONS WITH THE LIKES OF ADIDAS AND VEJA. NOT BAD FOR A GUY WHO FASTIDIOUSLY AVOIDED SNEAKERS WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP IN PORTERVILLE, CALIF., AND WOULD HIT THE GYM FOR WEIGHTLIFTING WEARING A BLACK SWEATSHIRT OR HOODIE, ARMY-SURPLUS CUTOFFS LAYERED OVER LEATHER JEANS — AND BIKER BOOTS. “I WAS VERY DRAMATIC IN THOSE DAYS. IT WAS IN HOLLYWOOD,” HE DEMURRED, ALSO NOTING, “I DON’T PERSPIRE THAT MUCH.” GROWING UP, “I JUST HATED THE INFORMAL AND SUBURBAN ETHOS OF SNEAKERS,” HE CONFESSED. AND THEN CAME THE RAMONES, THE AMERICAN PUNK ROCK BAND WHOSE SHAGGY HAIR, BIKER JACKETS, BEAT-UP JEANS AND SNEAKERS CONVULSED THE MUSIC SCENE IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND CAPTIVATED OWENS, WHO SO ADORED THEIR GRAPHIC STYLE THAT HE ONCE NAMED A SHOE AFTER THEM, PROMPTING A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. “THEY WORE CHUCK TAYLORS AND THAT WAS MY CONVERSE IMAGE,” OWENS SAID OVER ZOOM LAST WEEK FROM HIS MINIMALIST, TRAVERTINE-LINED APARTMENT ON THE LIDO. “I’VE BEEN REFERENCING [CONVERSE] FOR YEARS, SO WHEN THEY SUGGESTED A COLLABORATION, IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD, NATURAL THING TO DO,” THE DESIGNER SAID MATTER-OF-FACTLY. “AND IT KIND OF CLOSED THIS POETIC CIRCLE SINCE I’VE BEEN REFERENCING THEM FOR SO LONG AND THEY WERE COOL WITH IT.” NOT THAT OWENS WOULD EVER USE THE WORD POETIC TO DESCRIBE HIS INTERPRETATION OF CONVERSE CLASSICS. EXAGGERATED, BOMBASTIC AND “A LITTLE GROTESQUE” ARE SOME OF THE ADJECTIVES HE THREW OUT TO DESCRIBE HIS APPROACH TO SNEAKER DESIGN. “I ALWAYS THINK OF IT AS KIND OF CORRUPTING SOMETHING THAT EXISTS. AND I DON’T MEAN THAT IN AN AGGRESSIVE WAY,” HE SAID, EXPLAINING THAT HIS “AESTHETIC GESTURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT PERFECT OR TRADITIONAL BEAUTY CAN BE VERY STRICT AND CRUEL” AND THAT PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES “SIGNIFIES TOLERANCE FOR OTHER IDEAS.” THE APPROACH ALSO YIELDS SOME SERIOUSLY COOL KICKS. “I’VE HAD A CAP-TOED SNEAKER IN MY COLLECTION FOREVER, WHICH IS AN EXAGGERATED PARODY OF A SNEAKER,” OWENS SAID. “THERE WAS SOME KIND OF TIPPING POINT AND THEY JUST TOOK OFF.” FOR HIS CONVERSE COLLABORATION, UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF OWEN’S DRKSHDW BRAND, THE DESIGNER GAVE BRUTALIST AIRS TO CHUCK TAYLORS, ADDING THREE TOE CAPS AND TWO LAYERS OF RUBBER OUTSOLE, GIVING THE SHOE HEFT AND THE LOOK OF BUMPER CARS. THE PENTAGRAM, A RECURRING SYMBOL OF DRKSHDW, REPLACES THE STAR ON ANOTHER STYLE THAT HE DESCRIBED AS “MEGA CHUNKY.” OWENS CHARACTERIZES DRKSHDW AS “A LITTLE BIT ROUGHER,” DARKER AND YOUNGER THAN HIS SIGNATURE LABEL. “IT’S LIKE A RAMONES’ SONG,” HE CONCLUDED. OWENS FIRST PUT SNEAKERS ON THE RUNWAY AS A GUEST OF THE PITTI IMMAGINE TRADE FAIR IN 2006. “I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH OF A STATEMENT OR ANYTHING,” HE SAID. “THEY REFERENCED ALL OF THE CLASSIC SNEAKERS I’D EVER SEEN. I REDUCED THE DETAIL AND SIMPLIFIED THEM AND KIND OF CREATED MY CARTOON VERSION OF SNEAKERS.” “FEARLESS” IS HOW BRANDIS RUSSELL, GLOBAL VICE PRESIDENT OF FOOTWEAR AT CONVERSE, DESCRIBED OWENS’ PROVOCATIVE APPROACH. “BREAKING CONVENTION TO ADVANCE FIT, FORM AND FUNCTION” IS THE GOAL OF COLLABORATIONS AT CONVERSE AND “RICK IS THE MASTER OF DOING THIS,” SHE TOLD WWD. “HE’S DEFINED AN AESTHETIC AROUND PROVOCATIVE FORM AND DISTORTION OF SHAPE AND HAD REFERENCED OUR FOOTWEAR WITHIN THIS APPROACH.” RUSSELL NOTED THIS COLLABORATION MARKS THE FIRST TIME CONVERSE HAS INTRODUCED A SQUARE TOE IN A CENTURY OF EXISTENCE. THE CONVERSE X DRKSHDW LINE IS UNISEX IN A FULL SIZE RANGE, WITH THE INITIAL OFFERING PRICED AT $165 TO $170. IT INCLUDES TWO TURBODRK CHUCK 70S, INITIALLY IN BLACK, WITH LILY WHITE TO FOLLOW. “RICK OWENS WILL CONTINUE TO REIMAGINE AND RE-ARTICULATE CLASSIC CONVERSE SNEAKERS IN 2021 THROUGH HIS DRKSHDW LINE,” RUSSELL SAID. “WE’LL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER, AND TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR FOOTWEAR TOGETHER.” ASKED ABOUT THE ROLE OF COLLABORATIONS, RUSSELL CALLED THEM “INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT” AND “AS A BRAND, WE LOOK AT THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF A COLLABORATION AND TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PARTNERS THAT CAN MUTUALLY EVOLVE WITH OUR BRAND.” ONGOING COLLABORATORS AT CONVERSE INCLUDE COMME DES GARÇONS PLAY, A-COLD-WALL, FENG CHEN WANG, OFF-WHITE AND TYLER, THE CREATOR. AMONG NEWER NAMES TO THE FOLD ARE TELFAR CLEMENS, CHINATOWN MARKET AND KIM JONES, WHO HAS A PREPPY-TINGED RANGE RELEASING THIS SPRING, RUSSELL NOTED. IN THE INTERVIEW, OWENS CONFESSED THAT HE HAD LONG BRISTLED AT THE IDEA OF COLLABORATIONS, HIS INITIAL THINKING BEING, “I DON’T LIKE TOO MANY COOKS IN THE KITCHEN, AND I DON’T LIKE COMMITTEE DECISIONS.” “INITIALLY, I WOULD JUST COMPLETELY DISMISS THEM AS JUST BEING SOME KIND OF HYPE EXERCISE THAT WAS NOT PART OF MY WORLD,” HE SAID. “BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, I CAME TO REALIZE THAT IT’S A GREAT WAY TO MEET NEW PEOPLE, AND SEE HOW OTHER PEOPLE DO THINGS… AND IT’S KIND OF FUN WORKING WITH DIFFERENT TEAMS, AND IT’S STIMULATING, IT KIND OF FORCES ME TO THINK OF CHALLENGES AND NEW WAYS TO APPROACH THINGS. SO IT’S KIND OF A HEALTHY THING TO DO.” LAST YEAR, OWENS UNVEILED COLLABORATIONS WITH BIRKENSTOCK, MONCLER AND CHAMPION. HE SAID HE CHOOSES COLLABORATIONS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL FOR HIM “AND THAT HAVE SOME KIND OF LOGIC.” “OPENING THE DOORS TO COLLABORATIONS CAME VERY, VERY GRADUALLY AND VERY, VERY LATE,” HE SAID, ADDING WITH A WINK AND A CHUCKLE: “I’M A LOT FRIENDLIER THAN I USED TO BE.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

THE DRKSHDW PROJECT FINDS OWENS REIMAGINING THE ICONIC CHUCK 70 IN A MANNER THAT IS TRUE TO HIS DISTINCTIVE DESIGN AESTHETIC, AS SEEN ABOVE IN EXCLUSIVE BTS FILMED ESPECIALLY FOR &quot;NOT IN PARIS.&quot; OWENS HAS LONG SHOWN AN APPRECIATION FOR CONVERSE&#39;S BLACK AND WHITE FOOTWEAR, HAVING PREVIOUSLY DESIGNED HIS OWN INTERPRETATION OF THE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL STAR, KNOWN AS THE DRKSHDW SS14 RAMONES. &quot;WHEN I THINK OF CONVERSE, I THINK OF THE BLACK AND WHITE CHUCK TAYLORS AND THE PUNK ROCK GENERATION. THESE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ICONIC PILLARS OF MY AESTHETIC,&quot; THE DESIGNER SAID. &quot;WEARING CHUCK TAYLORS, YOU ALIGN YOURSELF WITH A GENERATION THAT WAS EXPERIMENTAL. THERE IS A CONFIDENT DYNAMIC TO THE SUBCULTURE.&quot; WITH THE TURBODRK CHUCK 70, AS THE COLLABORATIVE SHOE IS CALLED, OWENS HAS CONTORTED THE SHAPE OF THE CLASSIC CONVERSE SILHOUETTE BY EXTENDING THE TONGUE AND SQUARING THE TOE SIMILAR TO A PAIR OF BOOTS. &quot;WHEN I SEE SOMETHING UBIQUITOUS, I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO DISTORT IT,&quot; OWENS ADMITTED. &quot;I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THAT&#39;S ABOUT. MAYBE IT&#39;S SOME KIND OF ADOLESCENT RAGE. BUT THAT&#39;S ONE OF THE GREATEST APPEALS OF THE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL STAR.&quot; THE TRIPLE TOE-CAPPED CHUCK TAYLOR ARRIVES AS PART OF THE WIDER FALL/ WINTER 2021 COLLECTION. TITLED “GETHSEMANE,” THE NAME IS A NEW TESTAMENT REFERENCE TO THE GARDEN WHERE JESUS PRAYED BEFORE HIS CRUCIFIXION, OR AS OWENS CALLS IT, &quot;A PLACE OF UNEASY REPOSE AND DISQUIET BEFORE A FINAL RECKONING.&quot; THE FIRST LOOK – WHITE BRIEFS, FLOOR LENGTH COAT, AND HAIRY LEGS FROM THE THIGH-HIGH COWHIDE BOOTS – WAS A GOOD APPROXIMATION OF THE FW21 MOOD: THE SUPPRESSED RAGE OF CONTEMPORARY MASCULINITY AT ITS MOST PRIMITIVE AND PROVOCATIVE. FOR A BIT MORE BIBLICAL FLAIR, DON&#39;T MISS THE PENTAGRAM STITCHING ON THE FLY. ALTHOUGH COMMONLY SEEN AS A SATANIC SYMBOL, THE FIVE-POINTED STAR IS ALSO AN ALLUSION TO THE FIVE WOUNDS OF JESUS THAT HE ENDURED FROM BEING ON THE CROSS, TAKING US BACK TO THE COLLECTION’S NAMESAKE, THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE. ELSEWHERE, THINGS WERE LESS RAW WITH OWENS APPEARING SENSITIVE TO THE PLIGHT OF WHAT HE CALLS THE “MALE SUPPRESSED RAGE ON EVERY SIDE OF THE MORAL DIVIDE.” OWENS COUNTERS THE EXPOSING NATURE OF TIGHTY-WHITIES WITH SOME PROTECTIVE SHEARLING AND LEATHER JACKETS MADE WITH INTEGRATED GLOVES ON THE SLEEVE AND ZIP-UP FACE COVERINGS ON THE HOOD. SOME NEW COLORS WERE ADDED TO THE RICK OWENS PALETTE WITH KHAKI AND MAUVE SWEATERS RENDERED WITH SLEEVES AND NECK OPENINGS AS INTERCHANGEABLE. THE HEAVY RECYCLED CASHMERE KNITS CLUNG AND WRAPPED AROUND THE BODY LIKE A TOGA WITH VESTIGIAL SLEEVES TRAILING DOWN TO THE FLOOR. FOR THIS SEASON’S DENIM, OWENS RETURNED TO TURNED TO YAMAASHI ORIMONO FROM HIS DRKSHADOW CAPSULE, WHO WEAVES 16OZ BLACK SELVEDGE DENIM ON VINTAGE SAKAMOTO SHUTTLE LOOMS IN JAPAN FOR A HEAVY OVERSIZED JEAN. THE SOUNDTRACK – ALWAYS A DELIGHT AT RICK OWENS SHOWS – WAS AN EXTENDED REMIX OF “HELLRAP” BY RAP/METAL ARTIST GHOSTEMANE, COMPLEMENTED WITH CLOUDS OF OMINOUS FOG EMERGING IN FRONT OF THE HISTORIC TEMPIO VOTIVO MEMORIAL.

IT IS INDEED POETIC AND DESCRIBES HIS FORMATIVE YEARS AS A SMALL-TOWN, WIDE-EYED YOUNGSTER MOVING FROM PORTERVILLE TO LA TO EXPERIENCE LIFE – FULL THROTTLE. “WHEN I WAS A TEEN AND BECOMING PHYSICALLY AWARE, I SAW HOW A TIGHTLY-LACED ANKLE LEADING TO A BROAD, SOLIDLY PLANTED FOOT HAD A SIMPLE, MODEST, INDUSTRIAL MASCULINITY”, HE MUSES, ADDING, “ALMOST LIKE A CORSET BETWEEN A MUSCLED CALF AND A STURDY FOOT THAT ACTED AS A STOIC BALLAST. DMS EXEMPLIFIED THIS BEST.” AND SO, WHEN DR MARTENS CAME CALLING DECADES DOWN THE LINE, RICK OWED IT TO HIS PUNK ROCKER YOUTH TO SAY YES. THE TWO-PART COLLAB KICKS OFF IN MARCH WITH OWENS’S “CHUNKY HARDCORE” TAKE ON THE DM 1460 BEX PLATFORM SOLE BOOT WITH MEGA LACES INSPIRED BY SKATE CULTURE AND DESIGNED TO REPRESENT ORDER IN CHAOS. “MY ETERNAL STRUGGLE IS TRYING TO FIND BALANCE BETWEEN CONTROL AND COLLAPSE”, HE SAYS, SHEDDING LIGHT ON HIS JOURNEY AS A CREATIVE – ONE WHO TEAMS HIS OTHER-WORDLY DESIGNS WITH MONSTER PLATFORMS. “I HAVE EXPLORED BOTH IN EXTREMES: COMPLETE COLLAPSE WHERE I INDULGED WITHOUT SELF-RESTRAINT OR DISCIPLINE AND COMPLETE CONTROL, WHICH IS WHERE I’M AT NOW ENJOYING A FAIRLY REDUCED EXISTENCE.” THIS LOW-KEY PERIOD, DURING WHICH OWENS HAS BEEN “WORKING OUT LIKE A MOTHER F CKER TO FEEL ALIVE AND LOOK GREAT”, HAS ALIGNED WITH HIS RECONSIDERATION OF COLLABORATIONS AS AN INTERESTING PROPOSITION. “I’VE BEEN WORKING IN AN ISOLATED, RECLUSIVE WAY FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT COLLABORATIONS HAVE ADDED A NICE RHYTHM TO MY WORLD”, HE SAYS, OFF THE BACK OF A SUCCESSFUL, HIGH-PROFILE UNION WITH MONCLER. “I WAS SCEPTICAL THAT COLLABORATIONS WERE FAKE HYPE MACHINES, BUT I THINK THEY PORTRAY A SENSE OF UNITY THAT FEELS POSITIVE”. PLUS, HE ADDS, IT’S “EXHILARATING” TO SEE PEOPLE YOU PREVIOUSLY PERCEIVED AS “UPTIGHT” OPEN UP AND LEARN NEW WAYS OF WORKING. DR MARTENS HAS ALWAYS REPRESENTED THE STOIC AUTHENTICITY AND CONSISTENCY OWENS, WHO HAS BEEN STEADFAST IN HIS ABSOLUTE, BRUTALIST VISION, ADMIRES. “MAKING SOMETHING – WHETHER THAT’S A PRODUCT, AN AESTHETIC OR A GESTURE – AND STANDING BEHIND IT AND NOT THROWING IT AWAY IS BUILT INTO WHAT I DO”, HE ASSERTS. IT’S SOMETHING HE RECOGNISED IN LA’S EARLY PUNK SCENE. HE RECALLS DRIVING DOWN MELROSE AVENUE IN A FORD COMET – COMPLETE WITH FINS, STEER HORNS AND A STUFFED IGUANA AS A GEAR SHIFT – LISTENING TO MARLENE DIETRICH, WAGNER AND THE SISTERS OF MERCY, AND VISITING A HARDCORE STORE CALLED POSEUR. “IT WAS MENACING AND INTIMIDATING BUT HAD THE MOST SPECTACULAR PUNK PEOPLE THERE WHO WORE DR MARTENS,”, HE SAYS OF THE HEAVILY PIERCED AND TATTOOED INDIVIDUALS WHO BECAME HIS IDOLS AND PEERS. “TO SEE THESE CREATURES LIVING THEIR LIVES 24/7 LIKE THIS – NOT JUST WEARING SUNDAY BEST KIND OF FASHION – WAS THRILLING TO ME. I VOWED THAT IF I WAS EVER GOING TO PRESENT SOMETHING, I HAD TO FULLY LIVE IT AUTHENTICALLY.” WITH THAT GERM OF AN IDEA SAFELY PLANTED REGARDING HIS FUTURE, OWENS THREW HIMSELF INTO THE RAW, SWEATY ANARCHY OF THE PUNK MOVEMENT. “I RELISHED IN THE VIOLENCE AND HOMOEROTIC SEXUALITY OF THE MOSH PIT”, HE SHARES. “I’M PRETTY SURE SOME OF THE SCARS ON MY FACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INFLICTED BY DR MARTENS.” OWENS BACKTRACKS THAT THIS IS PERHAPS NOT THE MOST PROFESSIONAL LIGHT TO SHED ON HIS NEW BOOT TIE-UP, BUT HIS UNFILTERED APPROACH TO LIFE IS WHAT HAS EARNED HIM LEGIONS OF ACOLYTES WHO DRESS HEAD-TO-TOE IN RICK OWENS’S SIGNATURE GRUNGE-GLAMOUR UNIFORM. WHILE THE DARK UNDERWORLD OF THE DESIGNER’S IMAGINATION – AND HIS PENCHANT FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC, WHICH BLARES LOUDLY DURING OUR CONVERSATION – STILL BUBBLES AWAY, THERE’S NO DENYING ONE OF FASHION’S REBELS HAS SOFTENED. OWENS HAS, HE OFFERS UP, LEARNED TO COMPROMISE. “I DON’T NEED TO HAVE THE LAST WORD IN COLLABORATIONS BECAUSE I HAVE IT IN MY OWN LIFE”, HE NOTES, PREEMPTING THE SECOND DROP OF DR MARTENS X RICK OWENS IN MAY. AS FOR THAT BALANCE BETWEEN CONTROL AND COLLAPSE? “PERHAPS IN FIVE YEARS I’LL INDULGE MY ID AND ABANDON MY MORTALITY – IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS, DOESN’T IT?” OWENS’S INNER PUNK HAS NOT HAD HIS LAST WORD YET.

MARTENS ON BOOTS THAT NOD TO HIS LOS ANGELES YOUTH — 15 MARCH 2021 — BY STEFF YOTKA RICK OWENS HAS REALLY FIGURED OUT THIS POD THING. WHEN HE FACETIMES FROM HIS FACTORY IN CONCORDIA, ITALY, HE IS FRESHLY BACK FROM A TOUR OF ROME, ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL READY-TO-WEAR SHOW ON THE VENICE LIDO, AND IS NOW OCCUPIED WITH HOW TO MAKE HIS ITALIAN COMPLEX A LITTLE BIT MORE HOMEY FOR HIMSELF AND HIS TEAM. “I REALIZED THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SOLAR PANELS, WE HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO HAVE SUNSET COCKTAILS ON THE ROOFTOP, SO WE’RE GOING TO FIX THAT UP. THERE’S AN AREA THAT I’M PRETTY SURE WE CAN TURN INTO A VEGETABLE GARDEN FOR OUR CAFE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LITTLE CAFE HERE THAT WE ALL EAT AT—I’M GOING TO WORK ON THE MENU A LITTLE BIT TOO… AND MAYBE WE’RE GOING TO GET A CHICKEN COOP. WOULDN’T THAT BE AWESOME? OUR OWN EGGS.” CLEARLY RICK OWENS IS THRIVING. BUT EVEN SOMEONE AS FORWARD-THINKING AS HE IS CAN INDULGE IN A LITTLE RETROSPECTION. A NEW COLLABORATION WITH DR. MARTENS ON EIGHT-HOLE BOOTS WITH HIS SIGNATURE LACING HAS OWENS REFLECTING ON HIS OWN PAST AND REMEMBERING A TIME BEFORE HE HAD EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT. “ANYTHING RELATED TO DR. MARTENS JUST LEADS ME BACK TO THE ’80S AND L.A.,” HE BEGINS OVER THE PHONE. “I WAS THINKING OF RON ATHEY, BECAUSE RON ATHEY WAS MY FIRST STRONG FASHION IMPRESSION IN L.A. WHEN I FIRST STARTED I HAD A BIG CRUSH ON RON ATHEY.” FOR THE UNINFORMED, ATHEY IS A PROLIFIC PERFORMANCE ARTIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN BODY MODIFICATION. (OWENS CITES ATHEY’S PRINTING PRESS, A PERFORMANCE IN WHICH A COLLABORATOR’S BACK IS SLASHED AND THEIR BLOOD IS PRESSED ONTO TOWELS THAT ARE HUNG OVER THE AUDIENCE, AS A FAVORITE.) “WHEN I KNEW HIM, HE WAS WORKING AT POSEUR ON MELROSE AVENUE,” OWENS SAYS. “IT WAS SO INTIMIDATING. IT WAS LIKE THE AUTHENTIC PUNK PLACE WHERE YOU BOUGHT REAL EXPENSIVE BONDAGE TROUSERS—AND RON WORKED THERE. I HAD A JOB SCOUTING PUNKS FOR SOME TERRIBLE MOVIE, I CAN’T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE MOVIE, BUT I HAD TO SCOUT PUNKS FOR A NIGHTCLUB SCENE. I DON’T KNOW HOW I GOT THIS JOB BECAUSE I WASN’T AN AUTHENTIC PUNK AT ALL. BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I MET RON BECAUSE I WENT LOOKING ON MELROSE AVENUE AND I APPROACHED HIM. HE DIDN’T HAVE A RIDE, SO I GAVE HIM A RIDE THAT MORNING TO THE SET AND FELL IN LOVE—HE WAS JUST SO AMAZING LOOKING. I HAVE A REALLY GREAT PICTURE THAT I’M GOING TO SEND YOU.” AFTER THE CALL IMAGES OF A 20-SOMETHING GUY WITH HAIR SPIKED INTO A DOZEN PEAKS AND A NOSE RING CONNECTED TO HIS EARRING LIGHT UP MY PHONE SCREEN. “THIS IS EXACTLY HOW HE LOOKED WHEN I FIRST MET HIM. WE WERE BOTH 20 OR SOMETHING. HE KIND OF REPRESENTED THAT WORLD OF PUNK AUTHENTICITY TO ME.” IN THE FOUR DECADES SINCE, OWENS AND ATHEY HAVE REMAINED FRIENDS. TWO MORE PHONE ALERTS REVEAL THE ARTIST, NOW LIVING IN LONDON, WEARING A GLIMMERING COAT FROM OWENS’S SPRING 2019 BABEL COLLECTION. OWENS’S RECOLLECTIONS OF GROWING UP AN ASPIRING PUNK IN CALIFORNIA ARE DEFINITELY A “YOU REALLY HAD TO BE THERE” MOMENT. BUT THAT’S PART OF THE APPEAL OF DOC MARTENS—THE TOUGH BOOTS HAVE BEEN AN ENTRÉE FOR MANY INTO THE WORLDS OF STYLE, SELF-EXPRESSION, SEXUALITY, AND MUSIC. THE DR. MARTENS COLLABORATION COMPLETES A TRIFECTA OF EVERY-PERSON SHOES THAT OWENS HAS PUT HIS SPIN ON; FIRST CAME BIRKENSTOCKS AND CONVERSE, AND NOW DOCS. PREVIOUSLY, HE DID PROJECTS WITH ADIDAS AND VEJA. “THERE ARE PEOPLE, I THINK, WHO SEE ME DOING THESE COLLABS AND THINK I’M A SELL-OUT. I GET IT,” HE SAYS. “BUT I ALSO THINK OF IT AS CORRUPTING FROM WITHIN. IF WE’RE ABLE TO, WITH EACH OF OUR COLLABORATIONS, ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO PUSH A LITTLE FURTHER WITH THEIR ETHICAL THINKING, WITH THEIR SUSTAINABILITY—THAT’S A GREAT THING. WE CAN PUSH THE ENVELOPE FROM INSIDE.” BECOMING MORE MAINSTREAM IS SOMETHING THAT OWENS HAS TOUCHED ON OF LATE. “I’M NOT EXACTLY NICHE,” HE TOLD ME DURING AN INSTAGRAM LIVE CHAT IN JANUARY. AT THE TIME I BALKED, BUT, YOU KNOW, HE’S RIGHT. IN THE SAME WAY DOCS ARE A GATEWAY DRUG INTO STYLE, SO RICK HAS BECOME AN ENTRY POINT INTO FASHION. IT’S ALWAYS EVOLVING: HIS GEOBASKET KIDS HAVE BECOME KISS BOOT KIDS; MAYBE THEY’LL BECOME DR. MARTENS KIDS TOO. WHEN ASKED WHERE HE BOUGHT HIS OWN FIRST PAIR OF GATEWAY DRUG DOCS, OWENS COULDN’T REMEMBER. “YOU KNOW I DON’T EVER THINK I WENT INTO POSEUR!” HE SAYS OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PUNK STORE ON MELROSE AVE. “I WAS AFRAID I WOULD BE FOUND OUT, THAT I WASN’T A REAL PUNK.” WHO CAN’T RELATE? WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, TRYING TO EMULATE COURTNEY LOVE AND GWEN STEFANI, I WOULD LOITER OUTSIDE OF TRASH AND VAUDEVILLE ON SAINT MARK’S PLACE RATHER THAN GO IN, LEST THEY FIND OUT I WAS “JUST A TEENAGER FROM NEW JERSEY.” LAUGHING, OWENS SAYS, “WE’RE ALL JUST A TEENAGER FROM NEW JERSEY!” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

WHEN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SHOWED NO SIGN OF SLOWING, HE DECAMPED TO THE VILLAGE OF CONCORDIA, ITALY, WHERE HIS FACTORY IS BASED. OWENS DESCRIBES THE LOCATION AS IDYLLIC, BUT IS ALSO AWARE OF THE PRIVILEGE IT AFFORDS HIM. “IT SEEMS LESS OMINOUS HERE IN A PROVINCIAL VILLAGE THAN IT DOES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY,” HE SAYS. “IT’S NOT LIKE THERE’S MUCH TO DO HERE ANYWAY, SO WE DON’T FEEL THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATION.” OWENS’ TIME IN CONCORDIA — WHERE HE IS CURRENTLY PLANTING A NEW VEGETABLE GARDEN AND RECONFIGURING THE OWENSCORP CAFE MENU — IS SYMBOLIC OF HOW HIS PRIORITIES HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS. THIS INTERVIEW IS TAKING PLACE ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR SINCE RESTRICTIONS WERE ANNOUNCED ACROSS EUROPE. PARIS, THE CITY OWENS HAS CALLED HOME FOR 18 YEARS, HAS JUST BEEN PLUNGED INTO ANOTHER MONTH-LONG LOCKDOWN. “I’M COMING FROM A PRIVILEGED CORNER, I DIDN’T HAVE TO ENDURE A LOT OF THE HARDSHIPS AND I TOTALLY SYMPATHIZE AND EMPATHIZE WITH THAT,” HE SAYS. “I HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMFORT, I WAS ABLE TO GET QUIETER. I’M KIND OF RECLUSIVE ANYWAY, SO AN EXCUSE NOT TO ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD WASN’T REALLY A PROBLEM. I’LL REALLY REMEMBER THE FIRST LOCKDOWN AS A MAGIC TIME, BEING FORCED TO SIT UNDER A TREE EVERY DAY AND READ WAS A BLESSING, BEING ABLE TO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING WE HAD, BEING ABLE TO APPRECIATE HOW FAR WE’D COME, AND BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO US. I’LL NEVER FORGET IT.” OWENS’ APPRECIATION OF THE LAST YEAR REPRESENTS THE TWO SIDES OF THE PANDEMIC: WHILE MANY HAVE EXPERIENCED THEIR HARDEST AND MOST TRAUMATIC TIMES, OTHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRESS PAUSE. IN OWENS’ CASE, THE ENFORCED BREAK GAVE HIM AND HIS TEAM A NEW APPRECIATION OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING. “WHEN WE STARTED GOING BACK TO WORK, EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY TO BE BACK TOGETHER AND BACK AT WORK. THAT WAS JOYFUL. EVERYBODY WAS DETERMINED TO NOT LET THIS SLOW US DOWN,” HE SAYS. ONCE THE TEAM WAS BACK TOGETHER, THEY WORKED ON OWENS’ SOMBRE SPRING/SUMMER 2021 PRESENTATION, WHICH WAS MODELLED BY TYRONE DYLAN SUSMAN AND SHOT ENTIRELY IN HIS STUDIO. “THAT FELT LIKE THE SUITABLE THING FOR THE MOMENT,” OWENS CONTINUES. “IT FELT MODEST, INTIMATE AND PERSONAL.” AFTER THAT SHOW, HOWEVER, IT WAS TIME FOR OWENSCORP TO OPEN UP. RICK OWENS’ FALL/WINTER 2021 SHOW WAS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT AFFAIR, SHOT IN VENICE — WHERE OWENS LIVES FOR HALF THE YEAR — AND FEATURING A BIGGER CAST OF MODELS. “I REALIZED WE HAVE TO FIGHT BACK,” HE EXPLAINS. “IF WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTING EXCELLENCE IN THIS FIELD, WE HAVE TO STEP IT UP, WE HAVE TO BE A GOOD EXAMPLE AND WE HAVE TO DO OUR VERY BEST.” ALTHOUGH THE FW21 “GETHSEMANE” SHOW WAS MORE EXPANSIVE, IT WAS ALL PUT TOGETHER BY THE SMALL TEAM AT OWENS’ STUDIO, AS THE DESIGNER CONTINUED TO STRIP THINGS BACK. “SOME OF US HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 18 YEARS, SO THIS WAS A COMPLETELY NEW WAY TO PLAY TOGETHER. THE TEAM WERE THERE FROM THE CONCEPTION OF THE COLLECTION, PUTTING IT TOGETHER, ASSEMBLING EVERYTHING TO THE FINAL PRESENTATION,” OWENS SAYS. “THAT WAS VERY FULFILLING FOR ALL OF US, IT WAS A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC THAT WAS REALLY BONDING. IT TURNED INTO A PERSONAL, PRIVATE LITTLE CEREMONY.” IT WOULD BE EASY TO DISMISS FASHION AS A FRIVOLITY, PARTICULARLY IN THESE TIMES. OWENS IS AWAKE TO THAT. BUT HE VIEWS THE MEDIUM AS A VITAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION — AND, IN HIS WORDS, “COMMUNICATING IS WHAT WE’RE PUT ON EARTH TO DO.” “I DO BELIEVE FASHION AND AESTHETICS ARE A CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION, I BELIEVE THEY MOVE CIVILIZATION FORWARD,” HE SAYS. “YOU’RE GIVING A LOT OF MESSAGES THROUGH THE WAY YOU ADORN YOURSELF, AND ADORNING ONESELF HAS BEEN A HUMAN INSTINCT FOREVER.” “THE WAY YOU ARE TELLING PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE THROUGH YOUR CLOTHES WILL NEVER DIE, IT’S AN IMPORTANT PART OF COMMUNICATION. IT’S LIKE BREATHING, EATING AND F*CKING. YOU’VE GOT TO DO IT.” BESIDES, HE JOKES, “I CAN’T DO ANYTHING ELSE, SO I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS A CONTRIBUTION.” WHILE THE IDEA OF EXPRESSING YOURSELF THROUGH YOUR CLOTHING IS UNIVERSAL, OWENS’ WORK HAS ALWAYS VEERED TOWARDS THE SUBCULTURAL. FOR THREE DECADES, HE HAS FOSTERED A DEVOTED FAN BASE WHICH GOES ALL-IN FOR HIS DESIGNS — NO MATTER HOW FANTASTICAL. “CULT” IS THE WORD MOST FREQUENTLY ATTACHED TO HIS FOLLOWING. FOR OWENS, THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CLEAR ETHOS AND AESTHETICS HE HAS PURSUED. “WE BUILT A STRONG IDENTITY THAT PEOPLE CAN IDENTIFY WITH, BUT THAT PROBABLY EXCLUDED SOME OTHER PEOPLE,” HE SAYS, “WHICH I REGRET, BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUSIVE BUT IT ENDS UP BEING EXCLUSIVE.” YET UNLIKE SO MANY OF HIS COMPETITORS, OWENS ISN’T FIXATED ON ENDLESSLY GROWING HIS AUDIENCE. “THE CLOTHES I MAKE SERVE A NICHE,” HE SAYS. “THAT NICHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE, AND THAT NICHE WILL ALWAYS BE THERE. IT’S NOT HUGELY POPULAR, BUT THAT’S OK BECAUSE I DON’T NEED TO BE HUGE.” AWARE THAT THE WORLD HE’S CREATED CAN BE SEEN AS EXCLUSIVE FROM THE OUTSIDE, OWENS IS BEGINNING TO OPEN UP, AND IS DEVELOPING NEW ENTRY POINTS INTO HIS WORLD. AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, HE ANNOUNCED A STRING OF COLLABORATIONS THAT INCLUDED MONCLER AND STÜSSY, WHILE THIS YEAR BEGAN WITH A DIVISIVE RELEASE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CONVERSE, FOLLOWED BY A NEW TAKE ON THE DR. MARTENS 1460 AND, NOW, HIS SECOND COLLECTION WITH CHAMPION. “DOING COLLABORATIONS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING NEW EXERCISE FOR ME — ORIGINALLY I DISMISSED COLLABORATIONS AS HYPE MACHINES AND I ROLLED MY EYES, LIKE A LOT OF US,” HE EXPLAINS. “I’VE BEEN ALOOF AND RECLUSIVE FOR SO LONG, BUT I CHANGED MY LIFE A LITTLE BIT AND I OPENED UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. I WAS READY TO TALK TO PEOPLE, I WAS READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD MORE. BEFORE, I HAD MY HEAD DOWN, WORKING ON MY OWN IN ISOLATION. I’D BEEN DOING THAT FOR 18 YEARS, AND IT FELT LIKE TIME TO LOOK AROUND AND MEET SOME PEOPLE, GET INVOLVED AND PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD.” AS WELL AS OPENING HIMSELF UP TO THE WORLD — AND TO NEW PEOPLE — COLLABORATIONS HAVE ALSO HELPED OWENS CONTINUE TO SPREAD HIS MESSAGE. “THE MESSAGE I’VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME IS ONE OF TOLERANCE,” HE EXPLAINS. “INTOLERANCE IS SOMETHING THAT I LIVED WITH FOR ALL OF MY YOUTH AND I REALLY RESENTED THAT. I RESENTED A CONSERVATIVE INTOLERANCE JUDGING ME SO I RETALIATED. MY CAREER HAS BEEN ONE LONG ACT OF REVENGE. BEING ABLE TO SPREAD THAT REVENGE AND THAT SPIRIT OUT, THAT’S TOO ENTICING AND I CAN’T RESIST.” AS A RESULT, OWENS’ WORK– PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS — HAS MOVED FURTHER INTO THE REALM OF WEARABLE SCULPTURE, WITH THE AIM OF EXPANDING AND REDEFINING WHAT FASHION CAN LOOK LIKE. “I HAVE PROPOSED IDEAS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN UNIVERSALLY BEAUTIFUL, OR DO NOT FIT INTO THE SOMETIMES VERY RIGID STANDARDS OF CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY,” HE SAYS. “BY BLURRING THOSE BORDERS, OR EXPANDING THEM, I HAVE DONE A SERVICE. I HAVE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE NARROW PARAMETERS OF OUR CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL AESTHETICS.” AS HE CONTINUES TO BROADEN HIS MESSAGE, OWENS’ NEXT PROJECT IS THE NEWLY-REVEALED COLLABORATION WITH CHAMPION. WHILE THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME THE TWO BRANDS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER, IT REPRESENTS A MUCH LONGER, MORE CASUAL RELATIONSHIP, WHICH BEGAN WITH OWENS PARTLY BASING HIS LABEL’S LOGO ON CHAMPION’S SIGNATURE SCRIPT (COMBINED WITH A JEAN PATOU PERFUME LABEL FROM THE 1930S). A KEY FOCUS FOR THIS COLLABORATION IS A MOVE TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY. THROUGHOUT THE COLLECTION, ITEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED FROM ORGANIC, LOCAL AND RECYCLED MATERIALS — A PREREQUISITE FOR OWENS, WHO HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT ETHICAL PRODUCTION. “IT’S ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY, AND I LOVE THE IDEA OF RESPONSIBILITY,” OWENS SAYS. “THE FASHION WORLD CAN BE SO MUCH ABOUT ENTITLEMENT, BUT THE IDEA OF BEING GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU’VE GOT, AND TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS, THAT’S A MESSAGE I’VE BEEN PUSING A LOT. THINKING RESPONSIBLY AND LESS GLUTTONOUSLY. I LIKE THAT.” HE HOPES, TOO, THAT HIS APPROACH WILL SHAPE THE PRACTICES OF OTHER FASHION INDUSTRY PLAYERS. “WHEN I DO COLLABORATIONS, I’M WORKING WITH BIG GROUPS,” HE ADDS. “BIG GROUPS HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING CHANGES, SO WHEN I DO THESE COLLABORATIONS AND I EMPHASIZE THAT IT HAS TO BE MADE IN ITALY WITH A CERTAIN RADIUS FROM MY FACTORY, IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM ORGANIC FIBERS, IT HAS TO BE MORE CONSCIENTIOUS, I’M ENCOURAGING THESE COMPANIES TO APPLY THAT TO OTHER ELEMENTS OF THEIR BUSINESS. BEING ABLE TO WORK FROM THE INSIDE AND INFLUENCE COMPANIES LIKE THAT IS A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE, IT’S A TREMENDOUS ATTRACTION FOR ME. DOING IT ON MY OWN IS ONE THING, BUT THIS IS ENCOURAGING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO IT AS WELL.” GOING FORWARD, RICK OWENS IS KEEN TO LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF THE LAST YEAR. PARTLY INFLUENCED BY THE SMALLER WAY HE AND HIS TEAM HAVE HAD TO ORGANIZE SHOWS THIS YEAR, THEY ARE ALL EXPERIMENTING WITH NEW ROLES AT OWENSCORP HQ. “WE’RE ASKING PEOPLE TO WEAR NEW HATS HERE IN OUR GROUP, AND IT’S GREAT, HAVING BEEN SO STABLE FOR SO LONG. EVERYBODY HAS TO SHIFT AROUND AND TRY ON A NEW HAT.” THE LAST 12 MONTHS HAVE ALLOWED OWENS TO TAKE STOCK OF EVERYTHING HE HAS ACHIEVED OVER HIS CAREER, GIVING HIM A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HIS WORK, AND A NEW MESSAGE THAT HE IS KEEN TO SPREAD. “WE HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE NOW, WHEREAS BEFORE IT WAS MORE ABOUT SURVIVAL,” HE SAYS. “NOW THERE’S A LITTLE MORE ROOM FOR PLAY, AND PLAY IS ESSENTIAL. PLAY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE. BEING ABLE TO ENCOURAGE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT THING TO DO, AND DOING IT WITH OUR FAMILY HERE… THAT’S A GREAT NEW DYNAMIC.” IN THE SHORT TERM, HOWEVER, OWENS HAS A NEW FOCUS FOR HIS ENERGY: “MY VEGETABLE GARDEN, MY BEAUTIFUL VEGETABLE GARDEN HERE IN CONCORDIA.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

CLOTHES CAN ONLY TELL YOU SO MUCH. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW A PERSON, LOOK AT HOW THEY LIVE. &quot;INTERIORS ARE MORE PERMANENT. THEY DON&#39;T FLUCTUATE SO MUCH. WHEN YOU ARE CREATING AN INTERIOR IT IS SUCH A PERSONAL SIGNATURE. IT&#39;S MORE PROFOUND. YOU CAN REALLY FIGURE SOMEBODY OUT BY THEIR INTERIOR,&quot; RICK OWENS SAYS. THIS DEPTH OF MEANING AND EXPRESSION IS THE REASON HIS INSTAGRAM FEED IS CHOCK-FULL OF INTERIOR PORN. SO WHAT DO OWENS&#39;S OWN INTERIORS SAY ABOUT HIM? HE HAS HOMES IN PARIS AND VENICE, BUT HE DESCRIBES HIS APARTMENT IN CONCORDIA SULLA SECCHIA, THE SMALL, NORTH-ITALIAN TOWN WHERE HIS FACTORY COMPLEX IS BASED, AND WHERE HE SPENDS MONTHS AT A TIME WORKING ON HIS COLLECTIONS, AS HIS &quot;MOST RESOLVED&quot; LIVING SPACE. SITUATED ON THE TOP FLOOR OF A NEW-BUILD APARTMENT BLOCK, UNLIKE HIS OTHER SPACES, THERE WAS NO HISTORY TO CONTEND WITH. &quot;I COULD BUILD IT FROM THE GROUND UP, SO IT WAS AN EXERCISE IN MAKING IT PERFECT, AND I&#39;D NEVER DONE THAT WITH AN INTERIOR BEFORE,&quot; HE SAYS. HE&#39;S BEEN COMING TO CONCORDIA FOR MORE THAN 18 YEARS. AT FIRST HE WOULD SLEEP ON A MATTRESS IN HIS OFFICE AT THE FACTORY, WITH HIS ONLY EXCURSION OFF THE PREMISES A HALF-HOUR DRIVE TO THE GYM. THEN HE GOT DIGS IN A MOTEL ABOVE THE LOCAL PETROL STATION. WHAT IT LACKED IN COMFORT IT MADE UP FOR IN CREEPINESS. &quot;IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A PLACE A SERIAL KILLER STOPS AT. IT WAS SO BANAL AND BEIGE, BUT I LIKED IT BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS SINISTER EDGE TO IT. COMING TO CONCORDIA ALWAYS MEANT A KIND OF AUSTERITY. IT WAS VERY COMPROMISED LIVING, WHICH HAD AN APPEALING SENSE OF SACRIFICE, IF I&#39;M HONEST,&quot; HE SAYS WITH A PLEASING CURL OF HIS LIP. AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE SEVERELY DAMAGED THE TOWN IN 2012, THE REGION BEGAN TO REBUILD AND A BRAND NEW APARTMENT BLOCK WAS PLANNED OPPOSITE OWENS&#39;S FACTORY. HE SNAPPED UP THE WHOLE OF THE TOP FLOOR – &quot;IT WAS ACTUALLY THREE APARTMENTS&quot; – AND A LARGE TERRACE. &quot;I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD SOMETHING AS EXTRAVAGANTLY AS I WANTED TO AND I FULFILLED MY JEAN-MICHEL FRANK FANTASY,&quot; SAYS OWENS. THE GODFATHER OF FRENCH INTERIOR MINIMALISM, FRANK WAS A COUSIN OF THE TEENAGE DIARIST ANNE FRANK. HE JUMPED TO HIS DEATH FROM A MANHATTAN APARTMENT BLOCK IN 1941, BUT THE PURITY OF HIS &quot;IMPASSIVELY MONOLITHIC&quot; INTERWAR SPACES LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION. &quot;I&#39;D ALWAYS FETISHISED FRANK&#39;S INTERIORS AND HOW THEY WERE VAST AND MINIMAL, BUT EACH MATERIAL WAS SO THOUGHT OUT,&quot; SAYS OWENS, WHO COMBINED HIS FRANK OBSESSION WITH HIS LOVE OF 1930S ITALIAN RATIONALIST BUILDINGS AND FED THESE INFLUENCES INTO THIS, HIS MOST PERFECTED INTERIOR. &quot;I LIKE HAVING THE SIMPLEST THINGS AS SUMPTUOUS AS POSSIBLE,&quot; SAYS THE DESIGNER, AND HIS CONCORDIA APARTMENT IS AN ODE TO THAT GUIDING PRINCIPLE. ITS AUSTERITY AND PURITY IS, IN PART, A REACTION TO HIS LARGE, RAMBLING, CONCRETE-CLAD PARIS HOME. A HIGHLY CRAFTED, ULTRA-FUNCTIONAL SPACE, THE CONCORDIA HOME IS ENTIRELY RESPONSIVE TO HIS NEEDS. IT IS ESSENTIALLY ONE BIG ROOM, CLAD IN TRAVERTINE STONE, WITH A TRAVERTINE PLINTH FOR A BED. EVEN THE CUPBOARDS, OF WHICH THERE ARE FEW, ARE LINED IN TRAVERTINE. &quot;IT&#39;S NOT AS SUMPTUOUS AS MARBLE, WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT TOO FLASHY FOR ME,&quot; SAYS OWENS. FURNITURE IS LIMITED TO A SOFA, DESK AND A SET OF ELIEL SAARINEN CHAIRS FROM 1901: &quot;HE IS SOMEBODY THAT I HAVE FOLLOWED SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER. HE&#39;S AN ARCHITECTURAL HERO.&quot; WHICH LEAVES PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A FULL SET OF GYM EQUIPMENT AND THE DESIGNER&#39;S ARRAY OF TREASURED OBJECTS, WHICH INCLUDE AN EGYPTIAN SARCOPHAGUS, A HUMAN SKULL, A GEORGE MINNE SCULPTURE AND A NUMBER OF ITALIAN FUTURIST HEADS. OWENS HAS SPENT DECADES PATIENTLY BUILDING THIS COLLECTION, OFTEN WAITING YEARS FOR THE RIGHT PIECE TO COME UP AT AUCTION OR THROUGH HIS TRUSTED NETWORK OF DEALERS. &quot;MOST OF THE THINGS THAT I GET ARE THINGS I HAVE WANTED FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. I AM NOT AN IMPULSIVE BUYER AND I DON&#39;T LIKE CLUTTER. I DON&#39;T LIKE FILLING MY WORLD WITH IMPULSIVE THINGS. IT HAS TO BE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT.&quot; HE&#39;S SO FAITHFUL TO HIS OBJECTS THAT HE TRAVELS WITH THEM. &quot;EVERY SUMMER, WHEN IT&#39;S TIME TO GO TO THE VENICE APARTMENT, I HAVE THE SARCOPHAGUS, GEORGE MINNE AND SOME OTHER BRONZE THINGS ALL TRUCKED OVER TO THE LIDO, AND I HAVE THEM THERE FOR THE SUMMER. THE SARCOPHAGUS GOES IN THE GYM AND THE MINNE SCULPTURE GOES OUT ON THE TERRACE, AND THEN WHEN IT&#39;S TIME TO COME BACK TO CONCORDIA AND CLOSE THE LIDO APARTMENT, I JUST BRING IT ALL BACK. SO I MOVE THEM FOR THE SEASONS – THEY TRAVEL WITH ME BECAUSE WE&#39;RE VERY CLOSE.&quot; LIKE HIS VENICE APARTMENT – A SIMILARLY VAST SPACE, CLAD IN SARDINIAN STONE – CONCORDIA REFLECTS HIS HIGHLY DISCIPLINED WORK/ GYM/SLEEP ROUTINE. DESCRIBING A DAY IN HIS CONCORDIA SPACE, HE SAYS: &quot;I GET UP. I SHOWER. THERE IS A BIG TV IN FRONT OF THE BED AND I USUALLY PUT ON A BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE OR AN OLD EPISODE OF POIROT WITH THE SOUND OFF AND I PLAY SOME MARLENE DIETRICH OR OLD LIZA MINNELLI, OR SOME KIND OF JAZZ STUFF OR JULIE LONDON OR ROSEMARY CLOONEY. SOMETIMES IT&#39;S ALL DISCO OR SOMETIMES IT&#39;S ALL HEAVY TECHNO. THEN I JUST HAVE COFFEE AND GO TO THE FACTORY AND I COME BACK AROUND 2PM, AFTER LUNCH, AND I TAKE A NAP ON THE BIG TRAVERTINE BED AND THEN I GET UP AND GO BACK TO THE OFFICE. I WORK UNTIL AROUND 8.30, THEN I COME BACK, I DO HALF AN HOUR OR AN HOUR OF GYM, THEN DINNER IS DELIVERED, AND I EAT IN FRONT OF THE TV AND THEN I GO TO BED. IT&#39;S ALL VERY CIVILISED, AUSTERE AND MONASTIC.&quot; THE SPACE IS SO FINELY TUNED TO MEET HIS NEEDS THAT HE DESCRIBES THE KITCHEN, AS &quot;BARELY THERE, BECAUSE I NEVER COOK AND THERE&#39;S A DOMESTICITY TO A KITCHEN THAT I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT&quot;. EVERY DETAIL HAS BEEN FINESSED TO OWENS&#39;S EXACTING STANDARDS. THE LIGHT SWITCHES AND SOCKETS ARE CUSTOM-MADE (NO PLASTIC!) AND THE TOILETS HAVE BEEN CARVED OUT OF ONYX, &quot;TO MATCH THE TRAVERTINE&quot;. HE&#39;S PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THEM. &quot;TOILETS ARE ALWAYS A BIG THING FOR ME. YOU GO TO PEOPLE&#39;S HOUSES AND THEY HAVE AMAZING ART ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND THEN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM AND THEY HAVE A PLASTIC TOILET SEAT. IT IS JUST IMBALANCED.&quot; A TOILET IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE HIDDEN AWAY OR TREATED AS AN AESTHETIC AFTERTHOUGHT. HIS AIM, HE SAYS, IS TO &quot;ELEVATE THE ESSENTIAL TOOLS OF LIVING, SO THAT THE BAREST NECESSITIES ARE SUPERNATURAL - THAT&#39;S MY LEVEL OF COMFORT&quot;. COMFORT MEANS SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC TO OWENS. THE HIGHLY COLLECTIBLE FURNITURE HE DESIGNS – MONUMENTAL, SCULPTURAL, UNCOMPROMISING, ADAMANT – IS MADE TO EXPRESS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISCIPLINE. &quot;WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT DEMANDS YOU STAND UP A LITTLE STRAIGHTER AND A LITTLE BIT MORE FORMALLY, I DON&#39;T THINK THAT&#39;S A BAD THING,&quot; HE SAYS. NOT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS HIS AESTHETIC. OWENS HAD TO TRAIN HIS GARDENERS TO RESIST THEIR URGE TO IMPOSE A CONVENTIONAL ORDER ON THE PLANTS ON HIS WIDE, OPEN TERRACE. &quot;THEY WERE TRIMMING THE ROSES AND TRIMMING THE BUSHES AND TRIMMING THE JASMINE. I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO THEM I WANT THIS TO BE AS WILD AS POSSIBLE. I WANT THERE TO BE MONKEYS IN HERE. I WANT THIS TO BE AS SAVAGE AS YOU CAN MAKE IT.&quot; BUT IT&#39;S NOT ALL HARD EDGES. &quot;EVEN THOUGH MY PLACES ARE AUSTERE AND THEY LOOK AUSTERE, I LIE DOWN A LOT, SO THERE ARE MATTRESSES EVERYWHERE. I DON&#39;T LIE ON A MARBLE SLAB, I NEED BACK PILLOWS.&quot; OWENS HAS ALWAYS HAD A HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL APPROACH TO HIS SPACES. IN HIS TWENTIES, HE LIVED IN AN ABANDONED FACTORY IN LA THAT COULD ONLY BE ENTERED BY CLIMBING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ROOF. &quot;I LOVED IT. IT WAS SO ISOLATED. I COULD PLAY THE STEREO SO LOUD AND JUST WORK THERE. I DON&#39;T THINK I COULD LIVE IN THAT KIND OF ISOLATION NOW, BUT IT WAS GOOD THEN.&quot; ANOTHER APARTMENT HAD BROKEN WINDOWS AND A PIGEON LIVING IN THE KITCHEN CUPBOARD. HE SLEPT ON A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR AND, AT NIGHT, WOULD DRAW A CIRCLE OF AJAX AROUND IT TO CREATE A LINE THAT THE COCKROACHES COULDN&#39;T CROSS. LATER, HE UPGRADED TO A SET OF STOREFRONTS JUST OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. &quot;THEY WERE VERY OLD, WITH WONDERFUL HIGH CEILINGS THAT WERE VERY ROMANTIC, BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY ROUGH. THE SHOWER WAS A HOSE IN AN ALLEY.&quot; HE ENJOYS THE DEMANDS HIS HOMES MAKE ON HIM AND FINDS THE CHALLENGE OF LIVING IN SUCH A FOCUSED SPACE ESPECIALLY STIMULATING. &quot;YOUR ENVIRONMENT CAN REALLY CHANGE THE WAY YOU PERFORM. I FELT I NEEDED TO PUSH MYSELF MORE AND I NEEDED TO HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING TO HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF WORKING,&quot; HE SAYS OF THE DRIVE TO PERFECT HIS CONCORDIA HOME. COMPLACENCY IS THE ENEMY OF CREATIVITY.

MARTENS, ADIDAS AND CONVERSE. BUT ONE MAN’S CORRUPTION IS ANOTHER BRAND’S HIGHLY MARKETABLE COLLABORATION, AND MR. OWENS HAS GROWN TO APPRECIATE THESE PARTNERSHIPS. HE USED TO ROLL HIS EYES AT THEM UNTIL HE LEARNED, AFTER YEARS OF WORKING IN ISOLATION, THAT COLLABORATIONS ARE “A GREAT WAY TO MEET NEW PEOPLE,” HE SAID. HE SEEMS, NOW, TO BE HAVING A LOT OF FUN. “BEING ABLE TO CORRUPT SOMETHING PURE LIKE THAT IS KIND OF DELICIOUS,” HE SAID. “AND WHEN I SAY CORRUPT, I’M SAYING THAT AFFECTIONATELY. I’M TWEAKING SOMETHING THEY HAVE THAT EXISTS AND RE-PROPORTIONING THINGS. IT IS NOT CORRUPTING IN A MALICIOUS WAY. IT IS TEASING.” LAST WEEK, MR. OWENS ANNOUNCED HIS SECOND COLLABORATION WITH CONVERSE: TURBOWPN, HIS TAKE ON ITS WEAPON SNEAKER, ORIGINALLY RELEASED IN 1986. (HIS FIRST COLLABORATION, THE TURBODRK CHUCK 70, WHICH ADDED A PENTAGRAM AND SHARP SQUARE TOE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO THE CLASSIC CHUCK TAYLOR ALL STAR, WAS INTRODUCED DURING HIS MENSWEAR RUNWAY SHOW IN VENICE IN JANUARY.) HERE, MR. OWENS EXPLAINS HOW HE APPROACHES EACH NEW “CORRUPTION,” HIS LOVE FOR THE RAMONES, AND THE KIND OF COLLABORATION HE’LL NEVER DO. FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WHERE DO YOU START? BY JUST COMPLETELY DECONSTRUCTING WHATEVER ITEM YOU’RE WORKING ON? I START BY ASKING THEM, “WHAT ARE YOUR LIMITS?” I DON’T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME PURSUING THIS IDEA IF I FIND OUT THAT THIS MOLD IS GOING TO COST 10 MILLION EUROS. I NEED TO KNOW THE TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS AND LEGAL LIMITATIONS. WHAT CAN I DISTORT LEGALLY, AND WHAT IS TOO FAR? I LIKE DISTORTING THINGS ARCHITECTURALLY, IN A MORE PROFOUND WAY THAN ADDING A PRINT OR A DECORATION ON TOP. I LIKE TO DISTURB THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE PRODUCT THEY’RE DOING. A LOT OF THE PRODUCTS YOU DISTORT ARE VERY RECOGNIZABLE, ICONIC PIECES. WITH CONVERSE, DID YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT? DID YOU WEAR CHUCK TAYLORS WHEN YOU WERE A KID? I WASN’T COOL ENOUGH WHEN I WAS A KID. I KIND OF DOUBT THAT. NO, NO, OF COURSE I DID. WE ALL DID. EVERYBODY THAT WANTED TO LOOK LIKE THE RAMONES. AND THE RAMONES WERE MY STYLE IDOLS. THEY STILL ARE, KIND OF. I ASSOCIATE CONVERSE VERY MUCH WITH THE RAMONES, AND THAT’S WHAT MAKES CONVERSE SEEM LIKE KIND OF A SCRAPPY OUTSIDER SYMBOL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEIR LOOK WAS SO APPROACHABLE. SOME OF THE GUYS WERE KIND OF CUTE — THEY WEREN’T THE PRETTIEST GUYS, BUT THEY HAD THE RIGHT HAIR, THEY HAD THE RIGHT SKINNINESS, THEY HAD THE RIGHT LANGUOR, THEY HAD AN ELEMENT OF DANGER. AND THE MUSIC WAS VERY CARTOONISH. THE LYRICS ARE VERY SIMPLE BUT SIMPLE IN SUCH AN IKEBANA PERFECT JAPANESE FLORAL ARRANGEMENT KIND OF WAY — LIKE A HAIKU. THEY’RE LIKE A PUNK HAIKU. YOU’VE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE RAMONES FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IN PLACE WHEN YOU COME INTO CREATIVE BLOOM, WHEN YOU’RE AT THE AGE WHERE YOU START RECOGNIZING WHAT IT IS YOU’RE ATTRACTED TO, CREATIVELY, THAT STICKS WITH YOU FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. WE ALL HAVE A MOOD BOARD IN OUR HEADS OF EVERYTHING THAT STARTED AFFECTING US AESTHETICALLY AT A CERTAIN POINT. AND THE RAMONES WERE VERY MUCH PART OF THAT, WHEN I STARTED COLLECTING ALL OF MY AMULETS AND SYMBOLS AND IDEAS THAT WERE GOING TO COME TOGETHER TO BE MY PERSONAL LITTLE RELIGION. BUT I’M VERY CONSCIOUS OF NOT STAYING IN THE PAST. I’M ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR THE NEW RAMONES. WHEN I SEE MUSIC NOW, I’M THINKING: “YOU GUYS AREN’T SHOCKING ME ENOUGH. I WANT YOU TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE.” AT YOUR LAST SHOW IN JANUARY, YOU PUT YOUR NEW CHUCK TAYLORS ON THE RUNWAY, RIGHT ALONGSIDE THOSE HUGE, THIGH-HIGH, THICK LEATHER BOOTS. THEY’RE KIND OF DIFFERENT LOOKS. WHAT FOR YOU IS THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE BETWEEN THOSE SHOES? I DISTORTED THOSE SNEAKERS TO HAVE THE SAME TOE CAP AS MY PLATFORM BOOTS, SO I ARCHITECTURALLY ALIGNED THEM. BUT BESIDES THAT, THEY ARE BOTH SYMBOLS OF YOUTHFUL REBELLION FROM THE PAST. IF I’M THINKING OF THE RAMONES AS BEING FROM THE ’70S CBGB, I’M ALSO THINKING OF PLATFORM BOOTS FROM ONE OF MY OTHER FAVORITE BANDS, KISS. SO KISS AND THE RAMONES, THEY’RE TOTALLY IN THE SAME WORLD TO ME. THAT KIND OF FLAMBOYANCE AND BREATHLESSNESS AND SEARCH FOR ADVENTURE, I THINK THAT’S HOW IT FITS INTO MY WORLD — OR INTO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THAT SHOW. IN A PARTNERSHIP OR COLLABORATION, IS THERE SOMETHING THAT IS, LIKE, AN ABSOLUTE “NO” FOR YOU? I DON’T LIKE CHEAPNESS. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN DESIGNERS WERE DOING H&amp;M AND ZARA, AND I DON’T MEAN TO BE RUDE, BUT I FELT LIKE THAT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. WHEN IT IS ABOUT BRANDS THAT ARE DOING FAST DISPOSABLE CLOTHING, THAT DISTURBS ME, AND I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THAT BECAUSE DISPOSABILITY IS WHAT’S WRONG WITH OUR WORLD TODAY. SOMEBODY COULD VERY WELL SAY, YOU KNOW, INEXPENSIVE THINGS THAT I’VE DONE WITH THESE COLLABORATIONS ARE DISPOSABLE, TOO. BUT THESE ARE KIND OF ICONIC DESIGNS THAT ARE BEYOND DISPOSABILITY. SOME OF THESE BIGGER FAST BRANDS, THEY ARE DISPOSING OF IDEAS IN SUCH A VORACIOUS WAY. THAT IS EVERYTHING THAT I’M TRYING NOT TO DO. SO YEAH, THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES I WOULD REALLY AVOID. BUT NOT TO WORRY, THEY’RE NOT CALLING ME ANYWAY.

THE WAY THE SMOOTH BLACK BINOCULARS FIT INTO THE PERFECTLY FITTING VELVET-LINED INTERIOR REALLY STUCK WITH ME. AND NOT EXACTLY RELATED, I REMEMBER ASKING MY MOTHER TO MAKE AN OVERSIZED BLAZER FOR ME OUT OF A PAINTING TARP WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE. I APPLIQUED BLACK VINYL SPIKES ON THE SLEEVES AND WORE IT SHIRTLESS WITH HUGE WOODEN BEADED NECKLACES PAINTED BLACK. I HAD A NOSE RING WITH BLACK ROSARY BEADS CONNECTING IT TO AN EARRING. IT WAS KIND OF A BARBARIC NEW ROMANTIC GET-UP THAT I WORE CONSTANTLY, MUCH LIKE I WILL WEAR A LOOK CONSTANTLY NOW. THE RAMONES WERE ONE OF MY FIRST MUSICAL HEROES. THEY WERE SCRAPPY, CRUDE, AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY RAW. THEY HAD A MINIMALIST CONSISTENCY THAT ALIGNED THEM IN MY HEAD TO BRANCUSI OR DONALD JUDD. IF BLACK AND WHITE CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLORS WERE THEIR CHOICE OF FOOTWEAR, THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. I WANTED TO ALTER [THE CONVERSE X DRKSHDW TURBOWPN] MORE PROFOUNDLY THAN JUST DECORATING THEIR SURFACE. I WANTED TO MODIFY THEM ARCHITECTURALLY SO THEY BECAME BOMBASTIC AND OTHERWORLDLY. WHEN I EXTEND THINGS BEYOND THEIR ORIGINAL SPACE, I AM SUGGESTING AN OPENNESS TO POSSIBILITIES. BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT EMPATHY AND TOLERANCE IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF DOING THESE COLLABS. I AM TELLING KIDS THAT IF A FREAK LIKE ME CAN FIND AN AUDIENCE AND INDEPENDENTLY CREATE WITH AUTHENTIC JOY, THEN SO CAN THEY. WE DON’T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE NARROW STRICT RULES OF CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY, WE CAN FOLLOW ALTERNATIVE AND INVENTIVE PATHS THAT VALUE KINDNESS AND CONSIDERATION AND OPENNESS TO NEW IDEAS MORE. I AM LOVING THE BODY MANIPULATIONS OF ANTHROMORPH, SALVIA, AND FECAL MATTER, ALL OF WHOM I HAVE COLLABORATED WITH. THEIR REJECTION OF CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY RULES HAS FELT LIKE THE BREATH OF FRESH AIR I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. I SEE SUCH WIT IN THEIR DISREGARD OF COMFORTABLE CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY. I ADMIT THAT IN MY OWN HOUSE I AM USED TO GETTING WHAT I WANT IMMEDIATELY WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED. BUT I DON’T NEED THAT CONTROL WHEN I AM WORKING WITH SOMEONE ELSE. I AM HAPPY TO SEE HOW FAR THEY ARE WILLING TO GO AND ACCEPT THAT. I ALWAYS FOCUS ON WHAT I WANT TO SEE—WHAT WOULD DELIGHT OR IMPRESS ME. THIS ISN’T AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS WHEN YOU ALSO WANT TO BE A RESPONSIBLE MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY. THINKING SELFISHLY ABOUT YOUR OWN DELIGHT TAKES A BIT OF AN EFFORT SOMETIMES LOL. I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING BOLD, SLIGHTLY RECKLESS, AND INTELLECTUALLY CULTIVATED. I’M NOT SAYING I EVER GET THERE BUT SOMETIMES I COME CLOSE. MY COLLECTIONS ARE MY VERY PREDICTABLE REACTION TO MY IMAGINATION BEING OPPRESSED AND MOCKED IN MY YOUTH. MY COLLECTIONS ARE MY REVENGE. I HAVE FETISHIZED CRAFT AND TECHNIQUE IN THE PAST BUT AS TIME GOES ON, I JUST WANT TO REDUCE DOWN TO AN EVEN MORE PURE GESTURE—SIMPLE, MERCILESS AND PRIMAL. I NEVER PURSUE ANYTHING I DON’T EXPECT TO WORK. I TRY NOT TO OVERTHINK THINGS AND KEEP THE BIGGER PICTURE IN MIND. I TRY TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE AND THEN LEAP.

SOON THE LOCAL SUN-WORSHIPPERS WILL BE DISPLACED BY MOVIE STARS VISITING THE CINEMA FOR THE DEBUTS OF THEIR FILMS DURING THE INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE MOVIE THEATER, AT THE EXCELSIOR HOTEL WHERE DURING THE DAYS OF LA DOLCE VITA THE MASTROIANNIS AND BARDOTS WOULD DO THEIR PRESS DAYS ON THE BEACH, ONE OF THE LIDO LOCALS REGISTERS THIS CHANGE IN SEASONS AS A TURN IN PRIORITIES. “EVERYONE GOES FROM ‘HELLO, MISTER OWENS; HOW ARE YOU MISTER OWENS,’ TO, ‘WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?’” HE’S KIDDING, BUT EVEN RICK OWENS, WHO HAS MADE A HOME HERE FOR HIMSELF AND BROUGHT WORLDWIDE ATTENTION TO THIS LONG LAND SPIT ON THE ADRIATIC END OF THE VENETIAN LAGOON, SHOWING HIS LAST FOUR COLLECTIONS HERE DURING THE PANDEMIC, DOES NOT QUITE RECEIVE THE SAME DEFERENCE DURING THE FILM FESTIVAL AS DOES, SAY, MISTER CLOONEY. NOT THAT HE IS HERE FOR THE ATTENTION. IN 2014, OWENS BOUGHT A CONDOMINIUM APARTMENT ON THE TOP FLOOR OF A BUILDING JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE EXCELSIOR AND PROCEEDED TO RENOVATE IT INTO A BEACH HOUSE VERSION OF SUPERMAN’S FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE. THE 1970S AQUAMARINE CERAMIC FLOOR TILES WERE SOON REPLACED BY BROAD PANELS OF SICILIAN WHITE STONE, THE KITCHEN WAS DOWNSIZED TO A FRIDGE AND ESPRESSO MAKER TO MAKE ROOM FOR A GYM, AND THE BATHROOMS WERE COVERED IN A BROODING ONYX-COLORED MARBLE. BASICALLY, ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE OLD APARTMENT IS THE VIEW—360 DEGREES OF THE SEA AND THE LAGOON AND VENICE ITSELF—FROM THE WIDE, WRAPAROUND MARBLE TERRACE. IN THE OPEN LIVING-, DINING-ROOM, DEN AND OFFICE AREA, A BUST OF FILIPO TOMMASO MARINETTI, THE FOUNDER OF THE FUTURIST MOVEMENT, MADE BY THAYAHT (WHO ALSO INVENTED THE JUMPSUIT), PRESIDES OVER CONVERSATIONS, READING, AND WORK—A KIND OF MODERNIST MEMENTO MORI, AS OWENS DESCRIBES IT. “I’VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF FASCINATED BY THAT WHOLE MOVEMENT,” HE SAYS, “BECAUSE, AT THE BEGINNING, THE ITALIAN FUTURIST MOVEMENT WAS UTOPIAN. AND, IN ANY KIND OF ANY UTOPIAN MOVEMENT, THE INTENTIONS ARE ALWAYS HONORABLE AT THE BEGINNING, AND THEN THEY DEGENERATE.” ANOTHER FUTURIST BUST, BY RENATO BERTELLI, SITS ON THE COUNTER OF THE MASTER BATH. “IT’S THE STORY OF LIFE,” OWENS SAYS, “OF ASPIRATION, AND FAILURE AND RENEWAL. I THINK OF [THE BUSTS] AS SKULLS, MEMENTO MORI, TO REMIND YOU THAT ALL IS VANITY.” I TEASE OWENS THAT, WHILE IT IS EASY TO MISTAKE THE ALL-MIRROR GYM IN THE APARTMENT AS A KIND OF CHURCH OF VANITY, IT IS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE. “YOU SEE EVERY FLAW,” HE SAYS, AGREEING WITH A SMILE, AS IF HE HAS ANY FLAWS TO SEE. WORKING OUT HERE EVERY DAY, OWENS IS IN WHAT HE CONSIDERS TO BE THE BEST SHAPE OF HIS LIFE—WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING. BUT IF HIS DEDICATION TO THE WEIGHTS AND HIS WORK REGIME SEEMS SEVERE, HIS INTENTIONS DURING HIS SUMMERS IN THIS APARTMENT ARE ANYTHING BUT. HE COMES HERE TO PLAY, TO LIE ON THE BEACH AND BASK IN THE BALMY, PLACID SEA, TO READ AND DREAM AND MAKE PLANS—AND, YOU KNOW, PLAY DRESS UP IN A SILK CHIFFON CAPE, OBVIOUSLY. SO MAYBE THIS APARTMENT, INSPIRED IN LARGE PART BY LE CORBUSIER’S BEACH HOUSE CABANON, IS LESS FORTRESS THAN IT IS A FRAME FOR OWENS. MAYBE THE AUSTERE, ALL-MARBLE-EVERYTHING STRUCTURE DOES HELP TO KEEP OUT THE NOISE AND THE DISTRACTIONS, BUT IT ALSO MAKES FOR A CANVAS ON WHICH TO DRAPE A BEAUTIFULLY LIVED LIFE.

FOLLOWING THE TURBODRK AND TURBOWPN, RICK OWENS DRKSHDW AND CONVERSE HAVE PARTNERED ONCE AGAIN FOR A NEW RELEASE: THE DRKSTAR. GIVING US A DISTINCTLY-RICK TAKE ON THE CLASSIC CHUCK TAYLOR 70, THE DRKSTAR DEMONSTRATES A MASTERCLASS ON INFLATED PROPORTIONS AND SINGLE-ELEMENT MANIPULATION. BUILDING ON HIS INITIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CULT-CLASSIC SHOE, THE DRKSTAR WORKS BY EXAGGERATING EXISTING DESIGN MOTIFS, SUCH AS EXTENDING THE TONGUE AND BLOWING UP THE BUMPER. THE DRKSTAR’S DETAILING ALSO FEATURES BADGE BRANDING, PRINTED INSOLES AND CONSIDERED STITCHING. RICK OWENS’ DISTINCT DARK MINIMALISM SHINES THROUGH, COMBINED WITH CONVERSE’S CONTEMPORARY DESIGN PERSPECTIVE. UPON THEIR RELEASE, WE HIT UP THE DESIGNER TO GET THE LOWDOWN ON HOW HIS CHILDHOOD IMPACTED THE DESIGNS, THE POWER IN SUBVERSION, AND HIS (OTHER) FAVOURITE COLLABORATION FROM CONVERSE. AS A CALIFORNIAN NATIVE, HOW IMPORTANT WAS THE CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR TO YOUR WARDROBE GROWING UP? DO YOU FEEL YOUR CHILDHOOD FASHION INSPIRATIONS PLAYED A PART IN THE CREATION OF THE DRKSHDW SS14 RAMONES? I ALWAYS ASSOCIATED THESE SHOES WITH THE WAY THE RAMONES (THE BAND) LOOKED, AND THE BLUNT BUT GRACEFUL SIMPLICITY OF THEIR CHORD CHANGES AND LYRICS TO THEIR SONGS. THEY HAD THE PERFECT JEANS, PERFECT HAIR, PERFECT HIP BONES, AND PERFECT ATTITUDE. THEIR SONGS HAVE THE CONSISTENCY AND LOGICAL FOCUS OF A DONALD JUDD INSTALLATION. THROUGH THE ADDITION OF BREAKS IN THE TYPICAL LINES USUALLY SEEN ALONG THE MUDGUARD AND THE EXTENDED TONGUE, YOU PLAYFULLY WARP OUR OFTEN UNCHALLENGED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A CHUCK 70 SHOULD LOOK LIKE. WAS IT TRICKY TO DECIDE WHICH ELEMENTS OF THE COMPOSITION YOU WOULD ALTER, OR HAD YOU KNOWN WHERE YOU WOULD TAKE THIS DESIGN BACK WHEN YOU FIRST DESIGNED THE DRKSHDW SS14 RAMONES? I FRANKENSTEINED THE CLASSIC CHUCK TAYLOR BY SLAPPING MY OVERBLOWN BUMPER AND TOECAPS ON TOP OF IT. I NEEDED TO MAKE THEM MORE BOMBASTIC. LENGTHENING THE TONGUE WAS ANOTHER WAY FOR ME TO EXTEND AND TAKE UP MORE SPACE. IF ANYONE KNOWS ME, THEY WILL RECOGNISE MY IMPULSE TO MAKE SOMETHING STICK OUT OR DRAG ON THE FLOOR. DRAMA. WAS THERE A PARTICULAR REFERENCE POINT OR PLACE OF INSPIRATION THAT FUELED THE CREATIVE APPROACH TO THE DRKSHDW DRKSTAR COLLECTION? I ASKED TO REPLACE THE STAR WITH A PENTAGRAM. THERE WAS A STRONG REACTION FROM CONSERVATIVES EQUATING THIS WITH SATANISM, WHICH I ADMIT DELIGHTED ME, AS I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED TO PROVOKE RIGID MORALISTIC STANDARDS AND BIGOTRY. AS A YOUNG AND SENSITIVE SISSY, I WAS BULLIED BY THIS JUDGMENTAL MORAL MAJORITY ATTITUDE AND HAVE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO BALANCING OUT ITS WEIGHT IN THE WORLD. AFFECTIONATELY. I USE A PENTAGRAM TO REPRESENT A SORT OF MAGICAL AND PAGAN PLAYFULNESS. I LOVE GEOMETRIC SYMBOLS AS MANS EFFORTS TO TAKE STRAIGHT LINES TO CREATE A SENSE OF ORDER IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR. DRAWING A STAR FEELS LIKE A MAGIC RITE AND MAKING IT PHALLIC GIVES IT SOME CHEERFUL BITE. IF A TIE IS A UNIVERSAL SYMBOL OF RESPECTING A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND IF LIPSTICK IS A UNIVERSAL SYMBOL OF PROJECTING A KNOWING SOPHISTICATION, THE CHUCK TAYLOR IS A UNIVERSAL SYMBOL OF BEING OPEN TO A MORE LIBERAL AND CREATIVE ATTITUDE. I LIKE ENDORSING THAT IN MY OWN SMALL WAY. LASTLY, CONVERSE HAS BECOME BELOVED FOR THEIR OPEN-ARMS APPROACH TO COLLABORATIONS. HOWEVER, IS THERE A PAST CONVERSE COLLABORATION OTHER THAN YOUR OWN THAT REALLY CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION? WHO DO YOU THINK HAS UTILISED THE CONVERSE CANVAS IN AN ORIGINAL WAY? I LOVE THE SHOES I HAVE DONE WITH CONVERSE BUT I THINK COMME DES GARÇONS DID IT SO MUCH BETTER. NO ONE CAN MATCH THE LIGHT TOUCH, BUT BIG IMPACT, OF THAT LITTLE RED HEART.

SHOWN IN THE DARK BASEMENT OF THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, IT WAS A POWERFUL SENSORY EXPERIENCE: STROBE LIGHTS FLASHING, A SISTERS OF MERCY SOUNDTRACK BLASTING, AND SEVERAL MODELS WEARING TOWERING DAN FLAVIN-ISH FLUORESCENT LIGHT SCULPTURES AS CROWNS. SINCE I’M NOT IN PARIS THIS SEASON TO DART BACKSTAGE AFTER THE SHOW, RICK AGREED TO A LITTLE EMAIL EXCHANGE ABOUT THE COLLECTION AND ITS “GLAMSLEAZY LIGHT SEEKERS” WHO EMBODY HIS DESIRE TO INDULGE HIS ID. AS HE PUT IT, “THE CLOTHES ARE SAYING ‘IF EXPANSIVE CLOTHES ARE POSSIBLE, PERHAPS EXPANSIVE THOUGHT IS POSSIBLE….’” READ OUR EXCHANGE AND SEE IMAGES FROM HIS GNARLY COLLECTION BELOW. RICK, I WRITE TO YOU IN YOUR NATIVE CAPS LOCK. THX! I MEAN IT AS CHEERFUL PROCLAMATIONS NOT SHOUTING * WHAT A SHOW. YOU’RE BACK AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO FOR MEN’S FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FALL 2020 COLLECTION. HOW DO YOU FEEL?. LOVE IT- THIS CRUMBLING ART DECO VALHALLA FORTRESS IS MY FAVORITE SPOT IN PARIS AND BEING ABLE TO SET MY WORK AGAINST SO MANY CORNERS OF IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST PRIVILEGES OF MY LIFE. YOUR “GLAMSLEAZY LIGHT SEEKERS” WORE THESE AMAZING HEADPIECES MADE OF FLUORESCENT LIGHTBULBS. DID THEY PLUG IN WITH BATTERY PACKS? ARE THEY LIGHT, OR IS THIS A “HEAVY IS THE HEAD THAT WEARS THE CROWN” SITUATION? THEY PLUGGED INTO BATTERY PACKS FOR THE MODELS TO CARRY BUT THESE HELMETS WILL BE OFFERED FOR SALE TO PLUG INTO THE WALL- THEY STAND ALONE AS LAMPS. THAT REMINDED ME: FOR YOUR SHOW IN JUNE, YOUR MODELS HAD PERSONAL FOG MACHINES. DO YOU THINK HUMAN BEINGS ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THEIR OWN ENERGY OR ARE WE CONSTANTLY IN PURSUIT OF OUTSIDE SOURCES THAT GIVE US ENERGY? LIFE IS ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND PARTICIPATION- THE IDEAL SCENARIO WOULD BE TO BREATHE POSITIVE ENERGY IN AND BREATHE POSITIVE ENERGY OUT TO MOVE FORWARD AND PRODUCE MORE THAN WE CONSUME…..I’M STILL WORKING ON THAT…. YOU STARTED MAKING COATS WITH ENORMOUS SHOULDERS A FEW SEASONS AGO AND THEY’VE JUST KEPT GETTING BIGGER. THEY’RE A SIGNATURE NOW! HOW HAVE YOU CONTINUED TO EVOLVE THEIR SHAPE AND VOLUME? DO YOU EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE OUTERWEAR DEPENDING ON YOUR MOOD? THE WORLD CAN BE CLUTTERED AND SLOPPY - SOMBER AND IMPOSING TAILORING IS A REST FOR MY EYE- A SENSE OF CONSIDERED RESTRAINT AND FORMALITY- WITH A NOD TO THE GROTESQUE…..LIKE PANNIERS OR BUSTLES OR PLATFORM SHOES…. THEY STARTED, AS YOU SAID, AS A PARODY OF MASCULINITY. BUT NOW THEY’RE CAMP IN THE CLASSICAL SENSE OF THE WORD. BUT MAYBE THOSE ARE THE SAME THING? DO YOU OFTEN FIND YOU LATER ENJOY THINGS THAT YOU ONCE LAUGHED AT? CAMP IS THE EXCUSE TO ENJOY AND LAUGH AT THE SAME TIME. IT&#39;S A CYNICS EXCUSE TO EMBRACE THE SENTIMENTAL. IN A WAY THE STORY OF RICK COLLECTIONS IS THAT THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SHRINK AND SHRINK. A PLUNDERING OF THE EXTREMES IN VOLUME. MAYBE YOU DISAGREE. BUT: WOULD YOU SAY VOLUME IS YOUR PRIMARY MODE OF COMMUNICATION? I AM MORE INTERESTED IN CUT AND SCULPTURE THAN DECORATIVE SURFACE - THE WAY THE HEAD IS DISPLAYED ON A GARMENT- THE PROPORTION OF A DRAPED FIGURE IN A ROOM. I LIKE TO SEE THINGS THAT DON&#39;T CONFORM TO STANDARD BOUNDARIES. THE CLOTHES ARE SAYING “IF EXPANSIVE CLOTHES ARE POSSIBLE, PERHAPS EXPANSIVE THOUGHT IS POSSIBLE….&quot; YOU’RE ONE OF THE FEW DESIGNERS WHO’S INTEGRATED THE MASK INTO YOUR SHOWS. YOU DID THOSE GHOSTLY VEIL MASKS, FOR EXAMPLE, AND NOW THESE DUVET COATS WHOSE HOODS ZIP ALL THE WAY UP TO THE FACE, WITH HOLES FOR THE EYES. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF REALITY IN YOUR SHOWS? FASHION IS A CONTINUOUS RESPONSE TO THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT AND IT WOULDNT FEEL HONEST OF ME TO IGNORE THAT. THE FINAL JOYRIDE OF EVERY RICK SHOW IS WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR BOW AND WE GET TO SEE YOUR OUTFIT. YOU ALWAYS LOOK GREAT! HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO WEAR TO YOUR SHOW? I WEAR WHAT I WEAR EVERY DAY.

IN FACT, THE 30-YEAR-OLD MUSICAL ARTIST IS A WEIRDO. CASH WAS FIRST LET OUT OF THE CAGE IN 2018 WITH HIS SOPHOMORE ALBUM ¥€$, WHICH INCLUDED FEATURES FROM HYPERPOP ROYALS LIKE CHARLI XCX AND CAROLINE POLACHECK. SINCE THEN, THE ESTONIA-BORN UKRAINIAN-RUSSIAN ARTIST HAS BEEN RAISING A RUCKUS WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL POST-SOVIET RAP SOUND, SUBVERSIVE FASHION DESIGNS, AND PROVOCATIVE SCULPTURAL WORKS. CASH’S TRANSGRESSIVE TASTE HAS DRAWN HIM INTO COLLABORATIONS WITH EVERYONE FROM MAISON MARGIELA AND IKEA, TO DIPLO, 100 GECS, AND BOYS NOIZE. BUT FOR ALL HIS CREATIVE MIND-MELDING, THERE’S ONE PERSON THAT CASH KEEPS COMING BACK TO. RICK OWENS HAS BECOME THE ARTIST’S CREATIVE CONFIDANT, PARTNERING WITH CASH ON “THE PURE AND THE DAMNED,” A COLLECTION OF THE PAIR’S RAUNCHY LARGE-SCALE PAINTINGS EXHIBITED IN CASH’S HOMETOWN OF TALINN; APPEARING ON CASH’S SONG “MONA LISA;” AND CO-PRODUCING A SERIES OF NFTS. OWENS—OR “DADDY,” AS CASH CALLS HIM—HAS ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS BOTH MUSE AND MENTOR FOR THE EASTERN EUROPEAN INGENUE. SO, IT’S NO SURPRISE THAT, AS CASH WOUND DOWN THE NORTH AMERICAN LEG OF HIS BIGGEST AND STRONGEST WORLD TOUR, HE MADE TIME TO CHECK IN. HERE, THE PAIR DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING ART IN TRYING TIMES, STAYING SANE ON THE ROAD, AND A MYSTERIOUS TANK OF PARISIAN SPERM. – ERNESTO MACIAS TOMMY CASH : HEY, DADDY. RICK OWENS: HELLO, HANDSOME. LOOK HOW YOUR PRETTY HAIR IS. I’M GLAD YOU’RE NOT CUTTING IT. CASH: YOU KNOW, I HAVE MOMENTS IN MY LIFE WHERE I THINK ABOUT IT, BUT IT’S ONLY FOR, LIKE, A MILLISECOND. I’LL KEEP GROWING IT. OWENS: WELL, WHENEVER YOU CONSIDER IT, THINK OF ME AND WHETHER OR NOT I WILL APPROVE. CASH: I’M ALWAYS THINKING, “RICK HAS HAD HIS LONG HAIR FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. I SHOULD KEEP GOING.” OWENS: “HOW CAN I PLEASE RICK?” CASH: THAT’S RIGHT. YOU’RE THE DAD YOU KNOW, SO I’M TRYING. WHERE ARE YOU? OWENS: I’M AT MY FACTORY IN CONCORDIA, ITALY. CASH: SO, STRAIGHT AWAY AFTER FASHION WEEK, RICK DOESN’T REST AT ALL? OWENS: WELL, I DID. MY SHOW WAS THURSDAY, AND FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK, I JUST WENT TO MUSEUMS. MICHELE [LAMY] AND I HAD A PARTY, AND WE WENT TO SOME OTHER PARTIES. TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE SHOW, I WENT TO THE DOLOMITES, AND I WAS IN THE SNOW FOR THREE DAYS. THAT WAS GREAT. MY LIFE ISN’T REALLY AS STRESSFUL AS YOU MIGHT THINK. IT’S ALWAYS ROLLING ALONG AND EVERYTHING’S KIND OF ORGANIZED, SO I DON’T NEED A LOT OF TIME OFF. OH, AND MICHELE AND I WENT TO EGYPT LAST MONTH FOR 10 DAYS. I DEFINITELY TAKE PLENTY OF UNPLUG TIME. WHERE ARE YOU— IN A HOTEL ROOM? CASH: I’M IN D.C., AND I HAVE TWO SHOWS LEFT IN AMERICA. TONIGHT IN DC IS SOLD OUT, AND TOMORROW IN NEW YORK IS ALSO SOLD OUT. OWENS: CONGRATULATIONS. MICHELE SAW YOU IN LOS ANGELES. CASH: YES, YES. OWENS: DID YOU SEE HER? YOU WERE AT THE POOL AT THE CHATEAU [MARMONT], RIGHT? CASH: YEAH WE WERE BY THE POOL THE NEXT DAY. IT WAS VERY NICE TO SEE HER THERE, AND SHE ALSO CAME TO THE CONCERT BEFORE. I WAS FRESH THEN. WELL, I’M FRESH NOW TOO, BUT MY BODY ALREADY FEELS—I’M GOING TO NEED A BREAK FOR THREE WEEKS AFTER THIS, BECAUSE MY BODY NEEDS IT. IT’S STRESSFUL TO DO SO MANY GIGS. OWENS: I CAN’T IMAGINE HOW GRUELING THAT MUST BE, IT MUST BE SO EXHAUSTING. DO YOU EAT WELL? CASH: YEAH, I EAT WELL. I ACTUALLY LOST LIKE EIGHT KILOS IN AMERICA, BECAUSE I’VE BEEN EATING VERY WELL. WE’RE EATING ONLY CLEAN STUFF AFTER THE GIGS—SALADS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I’VE BEEN MAINTAINING MY SANITY BECAUSE I DO A LOT OF CARDIO ON STAGE. I CAN’T DO WHAT I USUALLY DO, LIKE SWIMMING OR WEIGHTS. I THINK MY MUSCLES HAVE COMPRESSED BECAUSE OF ALL THE JUMPING AND SWEATING. THIS TOUR HAS BASICALLY BEEN A FITNESS BOOTCAMP. OWENS: BUT YOU MUST LOOK REALLY GOOD, THOUGH. YOU MUST BE PRETTY DEFINED RIGHT NOW, RIGHT? CASH : YES. I WAS THE STRONGEST I’D EVER BEEN BEFORE I CAME TO TOUR. WE WERE GOING HARD IN THE GYM, AND NOW MY BODY HAS TRANSFORMED THE BODY I NEED TO HAVE ON THE STAGE—LIGHT ENOUGH, FAST ENOUGH, YOU KNOW, LIKE A STATUE. OWENS: WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE SONG TO PERFORM ON TOUR? CASH: I THINK MAYBE “X RAY.” IT’S THE FIRST SONG. I LOVE TO TALK. I DON’T TALK MUCH BETWEEN SONGS, BUT IT’S ALWAYS FUN—“HEY GUYS, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?”—WEIRD STUFF LIKE THAT. OWENS: DO YOU DO A MONOLOGUE? CASH : MY FAVORITE PART IS WHEN I SAY, “HEY, MY NAME IS TOMMY CASH,” AND PEOPLE GO “WHOA!” AND THAT’S IT. OWENS: IT MUST BE VERY SATISFYING. CASH : YES, THAT’S VERY SATISFYING. OWENS: I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT. I WOULD LOVE TO GO, “HEY, IT’S RICK OWENS” AND JUST HEAR CHEERING. CASH : BUT WHY DO YOU NEVER TALK AFTER YOUR SHOWS? WHY? OWENS: I DO TALK. CASH: YOU STORM OFF, REALLY. OWENS: WELL, BACKSTAGE, I TALK. I MEAN, I’M NOT GONNA STAND THERE AND START TALKING AT EVERYONE RIGHT AFTER MY SHOW, THAT’S KIND OF WEIRD. WHAT DESIGNER HAS EVER DONE THAT? CASH : THAT’S WHAT I’M ASKING. WHY IT ISN’T COMMON? OWENS: OH, I SHOULD TRY IT? I FEEL LIKE YOU JUST DON’T WANT TO RUIN THE MAGIC OF A SHOW. I TRY NOT TO SMILE, BECAUSE WHEN WE’VE DONE A BEAUTIFUL, SERENE SHOW AND THEN I COME BOUNCING OUT SMILING AT EVERYBODY, THEN IT RUINS IT. SO, IS THERE A NEW ALBUM COMING? CASH : YES, DEFINITELY. OWENS: DO YOU KNOW THE TIMELINE? OR YOU DON’T WANT TO DEFINE IT. CASH : YOU KNOW HOW WE MUSICIANS ARE. WE TAKE OUR TIME. BUT I LOVE THAT IN THE FASHION WORLD, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NEW COLLECTION EVERY SIX MONTHS. MAYBE IT SHOULD BE LIKE THAT WITH MUSIC? OWENS: I LOVE IT. IT GIVES ME A SENSE OF PURPOSE, IT GIVES ME CYCLES, AND IT GIVES ME A SENSE OF CONSISTENCY. IF YOU HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE HARD TO MAKE DECISIONS. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING CONVINCING. CASH: I’M GONNA TRY TO USE THIS— THE STRUCTURE—I THINK I NEED IT. OWENS: IS TRAVELING GOOD FOR YOUR CREATIVITY, OR IS IT BAD? CASH: I THINK IT’S GOOD. OWENS: I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING IN MOTION, IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF MOMENTUM, BUT ALSO THERE’S KIND OF NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO—IT RELEASES YOU FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITIES OF HAVING TO DO ANYTHING ELSE, EXCEPT MOVE FORWARD. I NEVER TOLD YOU MY FAVORITE SONG OF YOURS: ITS “DOSTOYEVSKY.” I WANT MORE OF THAT SOUND, I WANT A WHOLE ALBUM OF THAT—WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? CASH: I DON’T KNOW, IT’S VERY HARD PUNCHING SOUNDS—IT’S VERY AGGRESSIVE. OWENS: VERY AGGRESSIVE. A WHOLE ALBUM OF THAT, OR GIVE ME A 20 MINUTE REMIX OF THAT SONG. YOUR MUSIC HAS A LOT OF HUMOR, BUT THERE’S ALSO SOME MENACE IN IT, WE LOVE A LITTLE BIT OF MENACE. THERE’S A BALANCE TO HI. YOU WALKED THE RUNWAY FOR MARINE SERRE, AND YOU LOOKED GREAT, YOU HAD A VERY SCARY LOOK. HOW WAS THAT? YOU’RE A RUNWAY MODEL, WOW. CASH : IT FELT GOOD. I WAS SO ANGRY. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF WHAT’S GOING ON IN THE WORLD—I FELT THIS ANGER. I’M BEING A BIT PRESSURED BECAUSE I’M BOTH RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN. I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE, SO I HAVE TO LISTEN TO MY PARENTS. MY DJ IS RUSSIAN AND MY MOM IS UKRAINIAN SO I GET BOTH SIDES, AND MY FANS ARE DEMANDING, EVERYONE IS—IT WAS LIKE THIS TORNADO. I WAS WALKING, I HAD ALL THIS KIND OF ANGER ABOUT EVERYTHING. WELL, ALSO BECAUSE OF WHAT I WAS WEARING, I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO PUT SOME EMOTION INTO IT. IT WAS KIND OF COMING OUT OF ME. OWENS: EVERYBODY IS EXPECTING YOU TO SAY THE RIGHT THING. IT’S VERY TRICKY BEING A PUBLIC FIGURE RIGHT NOW, I WOULD THINK. YOUR ROLE, THOUGH, IS TO CONTRIBUTE YOUR CREATIVITY TO THE WORLD. THAT IS THE MOST VALUABLE THING TO YOU CAN DO. CASH: IT IS. OWENS: YOU KNOW, OUR CULTURE NEEDS CREATIVE EXPRESSION LIKE YOURS, AND HERE YOU ARE CREATING IT. YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING A VERY VALUABLE SERVICE TO THE WORLD. I THINK YOU’RE GREAT. CASH : WE ARE, WE ARE, YES. OWENS: [OPENS A BOX] OOH, FUN THINGS FOR ME. IT’S SAMPLES OF THIS AESOP COLLABORATION I JUST DID. CASH: TELL ME ABOUT THIS NEW COLLAB, BECAUSE ALL MY FRIENDS WERE ASKING ME ABOUT IT. OWENS: WE’RE DOING THIS TRAVEL KIT—ALL MY FAVORITE AESOP PRODUCTS BUT RE-BRANDED, AND WE DID A PERFUME TOGETHER CALLED STOIC. CASH : HOW DOES IT SMELL? OWENS: IT’S LIKE INCENSE, VETIVER, AND ELEMI, WHICH IS SOME KIND OF TREE. SO, DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO CHECK OUT THE SITES WHILE YOU WERE IN L.A.? CASH : NOT REALLY. I THINK I’M MORE A FAN OF THE WEIRD CITIES, LIKE SEATTLE AND DETROIT. OWENS: WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT DETROIT? I’VE NEVER BEEN TO DETROIT. CASH : IT’S A LITTLE BIT LIKE EASTERN EUROPE, A LITTLE BIT EMPTY AND PEOPLE ARE ROUGHER, I FEEL. I FEEL AT HOME THERE, AND I ALSO LOVE PITTSBURGH. I WENT TO SEE ANDY [WARHOL’S] GRAVE IN PITTSBURGH. I WENT AND TALKED TO ANDY. I LOVE WEIRD CITIES—I DON’T LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTERS ALL THE TIME, I LOVE THE WEIRD CHARACTERS. DO YOU GO TO THE CHATEAU MARMONT WHENEVER YOU’RE IN L.A.? OWENS: FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THAT’S WHERE WE STAY IN L.A. I ONLY RECENTLY STARTED RETURNING TO L.A. TO VISIT MY MOM, BUT BEFORE THAT I HADN’T BEEN TO L.A. FOR 27 YEARS OR SO. IT JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS IN A STATE OF DECLINE. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO COME TO ITALY? CASH : YOUR NEXT SHOW IS IN SIX MONTHS RIGHT? OWENS: IT’S A MEN’S SHOW IN JUNE IN PARIS. IT’S GONNA BE A FUN SHOW, YOU SHOULD COME FOR THAT ONE, PROVIDED THAT THE WORLD ISN’T OVER BY THEN. WE’VE GOT TO KEEP WORKING AND DOING OUR VERY BEST. WHAT’S HAPPENING IN ESTONIA? YOU LIVE MAINLY IN ESTONIA, YOU HAVEN’T THOUGHT ABOUT LIVING SOMEWHERE ELSE? CASH : NO, BUT I’M THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS OLD POST-SOVIET COMMUNE, AN OLD CONCRETE BUILDING. IT’S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, BUT I’D LOVE TO REBUILD IT AND HAVE MY OWN BASE THERE. OWENS: SOUNDS GREAT. I’M SO JEALOUS. CASH : YOU AND MICHELE ARE VERY BIG INSPIRATIONS, AND YOUR WORLD IS LIKE THAT— THE ARCHITECTURE FITS WITH THE CREATIONS. I’VE BEEN ALWAYS HONEST ABOUT MY PASSION FOR POST-SOVIET EVERYTHING, SO I’VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT FINDING A HOUSE LIKE THIS AND MAKING IT MY OWN. LIKE A BATCAVE, LET’S SAY. OWENS: YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME LAST WEEK IN PARIS, BECAUSE I WALKED PAST THAT TANK OF YOUR SEMEN EVERY DAY. CASH: [LAUGHS] THAT IS SO CUTE. I THINK OF US ALL THE TIME, TOO. OWENS: FOR THE READERS, YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN THE TANK OF SEMEN. YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN HOW I CAME TO HAVE A TANK OF YOUR SEMEN IN MY HOUSE. CASH : I THINK IT’S COOLER IF I DON’T EXPLAIN WHY. [LAUGHS] BUT IT’S AN ART PIECE PROTECTED BY THIS BULLETPROOF GLASS—IT’S FUNNY, BECAUSE I SAW YOU HAD THIS BIG PARTY DURING FASHION WEEK WITH DAVE CHAPPELLE, KANYE, PUSHA T AND WHOEVER, AND THERE’S A PHOTO THEM POSING WITH MY TANK OF SEMEN IN THE BACKGROUND. YOU KNOW WHAT’S BETTER THAN BEING IN THE PICTURE? HAVING YOUR SEMEN IN THE PICTURE. IT WAS SO COOL. OWENS: YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAGGED IN ALL OF THOSE. OH MY GOD, THAT’S SO GREAT.

DAYLIGHT ILLUMINATES THE MINIMALIST CONCRETE INTERIOR, EMPTY BUT FOR A SELECTION OF GYM MACHINES. A SHADOWY FIGURE LOOMS BEHIND HIM. THE DESIGNER’S LONG-TIME PARTNER MICHÈLE LAMY IS A BOXER – COULD THIS BE AN OVERSIZED, PERSON-SHAPED PUNCH BAG? NOT QUITE. ‘MY GOD,’ OWENS SIGHS. ‘IT’S AN EGYPTIAN SARCOPHAGUS.’ TO HERALD THE LAUNCH OF RICK OWENS SPRING/SUMMER 2022 COLLECTIONS ON MATCHESFASHION, WE GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH FASHION’S PRINCE OF DARKNESS. IN ANOTHER LIFE, WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING IF YOU WEREN’T A DESIGNER? ‘I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN ARCHITECTURE. BEING AN ARCHITECT IS THRILLING BECAUSE YOU LEAVE, PHYSICALLY, A MONUMENT TO YOURSELF ON EARTH.’ BOTH FASHION DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE ARE ABOUT LEGACY AND CREATING SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN INHABIT PHYSICALLY AFTER YOU’RE GONE. ‘LEGACY IS AN INTERESTING THING. WHEN I LOOK BACK ON BECOMING A FASHION DESIGNER, I’M HORRIFIED BY THE AMOUNT OF EGO AND AGGRESSION THAT IT TOOK TO INSIST THAT EVERYBODY LOOK AT WHAT I WAS DOING. I’M PROUD OF IT AND A LITTLE ASHAMED. ‘IN 2017, I WAS ASKED TO DO A RETROSPECTIVE AT THE TRIENNALE DI MILANO. IT WAS A BIG HONOUR. I AGREED TO DO IT ONLY IF I COULD DO THE CURATION. IT WAS A VERY VALIDATING PROCESS BECAUSE I CREATED MY OWN OBITUARY; I WAS ABLE TO QUIETLY ELIMINATE ANY MISTAKES I EVER THOUGHT I HAD MADE, AND CELEBRATE ONLY THE SUCCESSES.’ DO YOU FEEL THAT IT’S IMPORTANT THAT YOUR MESSAGE IS RECEIVED IN THE WAY YOU INTENDED IT? ‘WHEN I STARTED DOING RUNWAY SHOWS, I WAS INSECURE ABOUT THEM. I FELT THAT MY AESTHETIC WAS SO NARROW THAT IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO EXTEND THAT OVER A LONG TIME UNDER THE GLARE OF SPOTLIGHTS. I HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH THE RUNWAY WORLD; I’D NEVER EVEN BEEN TO A SHOW… BUT OVER TIME, PEOPLE DECIDED TO TOLERATE MY PACE AND EVOLUTION AND ACCEPTED IT. ‘I’M ABLE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT A SLOWER EVOLUTION THAT ISN’T THAT SENSATIONAL HAS A PLACE IN THE WORLD – THE OPPOSITE OF VORACIOUS CONSUMPTION. I THINK IT’S DUMB FOR ME TO DISAPPROVE OF ANYTHING, BUT I WANTED MY MESSAGE TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.’ YOU PRESENTED THE SS22 MEN’S COLLECTION FOGACHINE ON A BEACH NEAR VENICE, A SITE WHICH RECALLS THE SIMPLICITY AND FREEDOM OF NATURE. WAS THAT AN INTENTIONAL OPPOSITION TO OVERCONSUMPTION? ‘IT WAS A COMPLETELY PRACTICAL DECISION. DURING A PANDEMIC, HOW DO WE PRESENT FASHION IN A MODEST, SOFT, RESPECTFUL WAY? I FELT LIKE IT WAS THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO AT THAT MOMENT. ‘IN [THE] FACE OF ADVERSITY, YOU STEP UP AND DO YOUR VERY BEST. THAT’S WHY WE DECIDED WE HAD TO DO THESE PRESENTATIONS LIVE, AND THEY HAD TO BE LIVE STREAMED. AN ART DIRECTED AND EDITED VIDEO? WELL, I DIDN’T FEEL LIKE IT WAS ENOUGH FOR US. IT DOESN’T HAVE THE COURAGE OF DOING SOMETHING LIVE.’ THERE’S A VULNERABILITY TO LIVENESS. ‘DOING SOMETHING LIVE FEELS MORE HONOURABLE TO AN AUDIENCE THAT IS LOOKING TO YOU FOR EXCELLENCE. THERE IS AN HONESTY AND A DIRECTNESS. YOU ARE EXPOSING YOURSELF, SO THERE’S A COURAGE THERE THAT’S ADMIRABLE, I THINK, FOR PEOPLE.’ YOU APPROACH SHOWS WITH THE PRECISION AND DETAIL OF A DIRECTOR. HAS ANYONE BEEN INSTRUCTIVE IN DEVELOPING THAT QUALITY WITHIN YOU? ‘EARTH ARTISTS LIKE MICHAEL HEIZER, RICHARD SERRA OR JOSEPH BEUYS. WHEN I’VE DONE THE OUTDOOR SHOWS, I’VE ALWAYS WANTED AN ELEMENTAL FEELING. SMOKE OR FOG OR EARTH OR FIRE OR WATER ARE ELEMENTS THAT THAT MAKE YOU THINK OF TIMELESSNESS. I LIKE PUTTING MY CLOTHES IN A CONTEXT OF TIMELESSNESS: THIS COULD BE THE SKIRT THAT BELONGED TO AN EGYPTIAN BUILDER OF PYRAMIDS, AND IT’S WORN WITH SHOES REMINISCENT OF SOMETHING THE RAMONES WORE IN THE 1970S WITH A HEADDRESS FROM A 1920S SHOWGIRL… ‘I LIKE THE SCALE OF THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION IDEA AND MOOD TO BE AS HUGE AS POSSIBLE. WE’RE GOING TO TAKE UP AS MUCH SPACE WITH MODEST MEANS. WE’RE NOT GOING TO BUILD A SUPER-EXPENSIVE STAGE THAT’S GOING TO GET TORN DOWN AND THROWN AWAY TOMORROW. WE ARE GOING TO FILL THIS SPACE WITH BLUE SMOKE AND YELLOW SMOKE. WE’RE GOING TO FILL THIS SPACE WITH A HUGE FOUNTAIN THREE-STORIES HIGH. WE’RE GOING TO FILL THIS SPACE WITH BUBBLES. I ALWAYS SHOW IN THE SAME SPACE IN PARIS, THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, A MONUMENTAL ART DECO VALHALLA BUILDING. FILLING THAT SPACE IS A CHALLENGE, BUT IT’S A THRILL TOO. IT’S FUNNY HOW I STARTED OUT HESITANT ABOUT RUNWAY SHOWS AND I ENDED UP BEING MR THEATRE.’ AND THERE IS SUCH THEATRE WITHIN YOUR CLOTHES THEMSELVES – THE SCULPTURE, THE DRAPING, THE ARMOURER PERSPEX BOOTS... IT IS LIVING THEATRE. ‘WHEN I FIRST STARTED, I SWORE THAT ANYTHING I PUT ON A RUNWAY, WE WOULD PRODUCE AND SELL. I RESENTED THE FACT THAT THINGS ON THE RUNWAY WERE PROPOSED AS SPECIAL USE, SPECIAL OCCASION GARMENTS. MY MESSAGE WAS THAT EVERY DAY COULD BE FANTASY DAY, AND THAT YOU WEREN’T SAVING THINGS FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION. ‘THE PLATFORM BOOTS THAT I WEAR EVERY DAY [ARE] A “F CK YOU!” TO THE CONVENTIONAL WORLD. AND THAT’S WHAT I WANTED MY CLOTHES TO BE. I WAS RAISED IN A VERY SMALL, CONSERVATIVE TOWN AND MY FLAMBOYANCE WAS CRITICIZED. I WAS VERY BULLIED, AND THAT FILLED ME WITH RAGE. ‘WE HAVE LIMITATIONS. I AM PROMOTING EXTENDING BEYOND THOSE LIMITATIONS AND EXPLORING FURTHER. I’M SAYING, “GO! GO! EXTEND BEYOND WHAT IS ACCEPTED OR CONVENTIONAL.” ‘I SUPPOSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME I’M KIND OF ALL ABOUT A DARK FEROCITY. BUT WE ALSO PROPOSE A LOT OF GREY SOFTNESS. DARK FEROCITY IS FUN, BUT I BELIEVE IN GENTLENESS, SOFTNESS AND MODESTY, AND I THINK A LOT OF OUR CLOTHES CONVEY THAT.’ I’M INTERESTED TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT GENDER AND HOW IT FIGURES IN YOUR DESIGNS. ‘IT’S HARD TO SAY, BECAUSE I KEEP MIXING THEM UP ALL THE TIME. ANYTHING I SAY NOW, I MIGHT CONTRADICT TOMORROW. IN MY YOUNGER YEARS, I WORE FULL MAKE-UP, WHITE BASE WITH EXTRA-BLACK EYES. I THINK IN KABUKI TERMS WITH AN EXAGGERATION THAT DOESN’T REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE SEXUAL LIMITS.’ DO YOU THINK THAT FASHION HAS A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? ‘I THINK EVERYBODY HAS A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. FASHION IS VERY SIMILAR TO ART. CULTURAL AESTHETICS WILL OUTLIVE US ALL. WE’RE MAKING CLOTHES THAT NOBODY ON THE PLANET NEEDS. MY CLOTHES ARE PURE CREATIVE EXPRESSION. BUT PURE CREATIVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE WORLD. THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I THINK I’M A POLLUTION MACHINE, BUT I AM DOING MY BEST TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE HISTORY OF AESTHETICS IN THE WORLD. I THINK BY THE RESPONSE THAT I’M GETTING, I HAVE A VALID REASON FOR BEING HERE.’ YOU CAN CONVINCE PEOPLE OF YOUR VALIDITY BY MAKING THEM FEEL SOMETHING, BY FORGING AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION, WHICH IS WHAT YOU DO WITHIN EACH OF YOUR COLLECTIONS. ‘OH ABSOLUTELY. YOU WANT TO MAKE EMOTIONALLY MOVING POETRY. THAT’S WHAT ANY CREATOR DOES.’ LOOKING ACROSS SS22, HOW DID YOU WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL WHEN THEY WERE ENCOUNTERING EACH COLLECTION? ‘FOR FOGACHINE, THE MEN’S SS22 COLLECTION, I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING REASSURING. I WOULDN’T SAY SPIRITUAL, BECAUSE I’M NOT PROPOSING ANYTHING SPIRITUAL, BUT I WAS PROPOSING AN OPENNESS TO EXPLORING SPIRITUALITY. A SOFTNESS, A GENTLENESS, AS OPPOSED TO THE VIOLENCE OF THE MEN’S AW21 COLLECTION. THERE WAS A GIDDINESS THAT I WANTED – THE MUSIC WAS VERY OUT OF CONTROL. I WANTED A RECKLESSNESS, A GENTLE, HALLUCINOGENIC RECKLESSNESS. ‘THE WOMEN’S SS22 COLLECTION WAS A MOMENT WHERE WE WERE RETURNING TO PARIS AND WE HAD TO ADDRESS THE TRANSITION OF COMING BACK AFTER A PERIOD OF ISOLATION AND REFLECTION. DO I PRESENT SOMETHING MEEK AND MODEST AND GENTLE AND WITHDRAWN, OR DO WE SEIZE THE DAY? WE HAD TO GIVE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WERE ASKING US FOR – EXCELLENCE. WE HAD TO PROVIDE EXCELLENCE IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY.’ WHERE DO YOU SEE THE BRAND IN 2050? HOW DO YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD OF THE FUTURE ‘I’M CURIOUS AS TO ANY METHOD I CAN USE TO SHARE TO SHARE MY AESTHETIC MESSAGE. ANY FORM OF COMMUNICATION, I’M GOING TO LOOK AT SERIOUSLY: HOW CAN I CORRUPT THIS FORM OF COMMUNICATION IN MY IMAGE? HOW CAN I MODIFY EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDS ME SO THAT IT CONFORMS TO MY UNIVERSE? I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S ABOUT EGO. MAYBE IT’S JUST PLAYING, BECAUSE A SENSE OF PLAY IS ESSENTIAL TO THE WORLD.’ CAN YOU EVER FORESEE A MOMENT IN WHICH YOU STOP? ‘THERE MIGHT BE A MOMENT THAT SOMEBODY STOPS ME. I THINK THAT FOR ANYBODY WHO CREATES AND DEVELOPS A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN AUDIENCE, IT’S HARD TO WITHDRAW FROM THAT. FEELING PEOPLE RESPOND TO YOU IS THE MOST DELICIOUS THING. I’M NOT GOING TO LIE. ‘WHEN THAT TIME COMES, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I WILL HAVE REACHED SOME LEVEL OF SERENITY BUT FRANKLY, I DON’T SEE THAT HAPPENING. I DON’T SEE THAT SENSE OF SERENITY AND I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I EVER WILL. I’M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT.’ SERENITY IMPLIES AN ACCEPTANCE, A FULFILMENT, PERHAPS A CONCLUSION… ‘ACCEPTANCE AND FULFILMENT. ACCEPTANCE WITH WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD, AND GRATITUDE FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU’VE GOT INSTEAD OF A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT TO YOUR LIKING. ‘I‘M SO USED TO BEING ABLE TO GET MY WAY THAT IT HAS MADE ME PERHAPS A LITTLE SPOILT. I GET IMPATIENT IF I DON’T GET MY WAY FAST ENOUGH. BUT I’M NOT THAT BAD; WE DON&#39;T HAVE A FAST TURNOVER IN MY COMPANY, SO PEOPLE MUST NOT HATE ME. I HAVEN‘T GOT THE BALANCE AS RIGHT AS I WOULD LIKE TO, BUT I’M WORKING ON IT.’ I’VE GOT ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU, WHICH COMES FROM OUR CREATIVE DIRECTOR. IT’S VERY FITTING THAT YOU‘RE IN THE GYM BECAUSE HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT YOUR WORKOUT ROUTINE IS. ‘I WORK OUT EVERY DAY AND I HAVE THREE ROUTINES THAT I REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I’M 60 NOW, AND EVERYTHING’S STILL PRETTY GOOD. I’VE NEVER DONE CARDIO, I HATE CARDIO. I EAT LIKE A PIG AND I SMOKE, SO THERE YOU GO.’ Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

IN THE PAST THE AMERICAN, PARIS-BASED DESIGNER HAS WORKED WITH CONVERSE TO DESIGN HIS OWN SNEAKERS (WHICH SOLD OUT INSTANTLY UPON THEIR RELEASE), DR MARTENS, VEJA AND CHAMPION. NOW HE&#39;S DROPPED HIS MOST INTERESTING COLLABORATIVE PROJECT TO DATE, WITH SKINCARE BRAND AESOP. AESOP AND OWENS&#39; COLLABORATION CAME ABOUT AFTER THE 60-YEAR OLD DESIGNER APPROACHED THE 35-YEAR OLD BRAND. OWENS CONFESSES THAT HE HAS USED AESOP’S VEGAN HAIR AND BODY CARE PRODUCTS FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. IN 2017, THE NEW YORK TIMES REVEALED THAT OWENS “EMITS THE DELICIOUS SMELL OF AESOP FACE CREAM” AND A 2021 VOGUE PHOTOSHOOT OF HIS VENICE HOME SHOWED HE HAS A BATHROOM FULL OF ITS DISPENSERS. MEANWHILE THE PAIR HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR MUTUAL ADMIRATION FOR EACH OTHER’S DISTINCT APPROACH TO DESIGN: OWENS IS KNOWN FOR HIS GRUNGE-IFIED PUNK CLOTHING, WHILE AESOP HAS MASTERED THE ART OF CHIC, MINIMAL LABELLING. THE NEW, LIMITED EDITION COLLECTION COMPRISES PEPPERY, VETIVER-BASED AROMATIQUE CANDLE (AVAILABLE IN THREE SIZES) AND A TRAVEL KIT, WHICH FEATURES A QUARTET OF BODY AND HAIR CARE PRODUCTS - CORIANDER SEED BODY CLEANSER, RESOLUTE HYDRATING BODY BALM, AND THE CLASSIC SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER - AS WELL AS CERAMIC BEADS AND A JERSEY WRAP. THIS, OWENS SHARED ON INSTAGRAM, WAS INSPIRED BY THE T-SHIRTS WORN BY SID VICIOUS AND SEEN IN SATYAJIT RAY’S FILMS. THE STANDOUT CREATION FROM THE PAIR IS ARGUABLY THE STOIC EAU DE TOILETTE OIL, WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN THE TRAVEL KIT. DEVELOPED WITH AESOP COLLABORATOR AND EXPERT PERFUMER BARNABÉ FILLION, THE FRAGRANCE TAPS INTO BOTH LABEL&#39;S AESTHETICS AND SPICY BLACK PEPPER AND CORIANDER SEED REFLECT THE RADICAL NATURE OF RICK OWENS&#39;S LABEL, WHILE FRANKINCENSE AND WOODY NOTES CONJURE THE EQUANIMOUS SPIRIT OF AESOP. ALL PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE TO BUY NOW AT AESOP.COM. GQ SAT DOWN WITH OWENS TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE COLLABORATION, AS WELL AS HOW HE WINDS DOWN AND WHAT SCENTS HE FINDS ATTRACTIVE. WITH SUCH A BUSY LIFESTYLE, HOW DO YOU FIND SERENITY ON-THE-GO? I TAKE A 1.5 HOUR NAP EVERY DAY WITHOUT FAIL. WHEN I MOVED TO EUROPE IT WAS A WAY TO ESCAPE BEING OVERSATURATED WITH THE NEW PACE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION INTRODUCED INTO MY LIFE AND IT STUCK. I REALISED IT WAS PROBABLY MY VERSION OF A MEDITATIVE SELF-MEDICATION. WHAT ARE THE MUST HAVE ITEMS IN YOUR SUITCASE WHEN TRAVELLING? VERY FEW. I CAN TAKE A CARRY-ON ANYWHERE. BLACK SHORTS, BLACK CASHMERE TURTLENECK, BLACK AND WHITE T-SHIRTS, AND SNEAKERS TO WORK OUT. I USUALLY WEAR A TAILORED COAT AND PLATFORMS ON THE PLANE. AND ALWAYS A FEW BOOKS. WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN WITHIN HOMEWARES TO YOU? I LIKE SURROUNDING MYSELF WITH AS MUCH CUSTOMISATION AS I CAN AS A PROTECTIVE BUBBLE. I LIKE TO LIVE IN MY OWN PRIVATE FOG…I LIKE KEEPING THINGS STRICTLY REDUCED BUT THE ESSENTIALS AS REFINED AS POSSIBLE….LIKE CUSTOMISED TOILETS AND METAL ELECTRIC SOCKETS….AND PERSONAL SCENT…. WHY DID YOU WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH AESOP? I THINK WE BOTH SHARE A DESIRE TO BE AN OPTION FOR THOSE PURSUING A GENTLE, CAREFULLY CONSIDERED LIFE. MY DESIGNS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED BOLD BUT THE FOUNDATION IS ONE OF BENEVOLENCE. I HAVE BEEN USING AESOP EXCLUSIVELY FOR MY PERSONAL GROOMING NEEDS FOR YEARS. I AM NOT SURE IF IT WAS MY BODY RESPONDING POSITIVELY TO THE ALCHEMY OF THE UNGUENTS THEY PRODUCED, OR MY HEAD RESPONDING TO THE QUIET AND GENTLE AESTHETICS OF THEIR ETHOS AS A COMPANY, BUT AESOPS BALMS REPRESENTED A SOOTHING MOOD THAT I WANTED TO CONTINUE SEAMLESSLY THROUGH MY HOME LIFE AND MY TRAVEL LIFE. WHAT FRAGRANCE DO YOU WEAR? I LIKE DUSTY SCENTS LIKE PATCHOULI, FRANKINCENSE, AND SANDALWOOD. I WEAR A CUSTOM SCENT BARNABÉ FILLION MADE FOR ME WHICH LED TO US CREATING THIS OTHER SCENT TOGETHER FOR AESOP. WHAT FRAGRANCES DO YOU FIND ATTRACTIVE? I ALWAYS HAVE LONGIFLORUM LILIES IN MY PROXIMITY - I LOVE THEM IN BUD WITH A SHARP FRESH SCENT, I LOVE THEM AT THE FULL BLAST OF THEIR PEAK AND I LOVE THEM AT THEIR HEADY DECADENT DECLINE. WHAT IS BEAUTY TO YOU? GRACE AND KINDNESS.

IT&#39;S A CITY OF SUN BLEACHED AND PEELED GLAMOUR; LOUCHE, LEAN, DECADENT, DRUG ADDLED AND MORE THAN A BIT MALIGN. IT&#39;S THE LA THAT THE DESIGNER RICK OWENS SEEMS TO OCCUPY AND EVOKE IN HIS CLOTHING. OWENS COULD HAVE BECOME A MODERN DAY EDITH HEAD IF HE HAD BEEN ASKED TO DO WARDROBE FOR DAVID LYNCH&#39;S MULHOLLAND DRIVE; FROM &#39;THE BEAST&#39; AT THE BACK OF THE DINER NEAR THE BINS (ONE OF HIS DISHEVELLED AND INFINITELY DESIRABLE MEN&#39;S OVERCOATS WOULD HAVE WORKED A TREAT ON BEAST-MAN) TO ANY OF THE CAR­CRASHED/AMNESIAC/DEAD FEMALE LEADS (HIS SLINKY AND SCUFFED SILK FISHTAIL FROCKS HAVE ALL THE ELEGANTLY WORSE-FOR-WEAR QUALITIES REQUIRED). YET RICK OWENS HAS NOT EVEN SEEN THE FILM - HE JUST GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING PART OF IT AND HIS AESTHETIC DIRECTLY REFLECTS BOTH THE SMOOTH SEDUCTIVE AND SLIGHTLY SINISTER MOOD OF THE MYTHOLOGISED CITY. &quot;DIRTY HABITS, THAT&#39;S WHAT MY CLOTHING IS ALL ABOUT,&quot; SAYS THE MAN HIMSELF, LOOKING APPROPRIATELY UNKEMPT. &quot;I MEAN, IT&#39;S DIRTY CHIC, IT&#39;S TOTALLY MESSED UP, SO YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MESSING IT UP YOURSELF - I MESS IT UP FOR YOU. ALL THIS WONDERFUL CASHMERE IS ALREADY FUCKED UP ON YOUR BEHALF,&quot; HE SAYS, WAVING OVER TO HEAVING, LUXURIANT RAILS OF THE KNITTED STUFF. THE AIR IS THICK WITH CASHMERE MOTES - IT&#39;S THE DETRITUS OF GLAMOUR WHICH, IN A WAY, IS WHAT RICK OWENS DEALS WITH. &quot;THE CLOTHES ARE ERM... NOT SO SHINY. I GUESS THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY [HE ADDS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH, KNOWING HOW IN STYLE HE SOUNDS] IS THAT IT&#39;S NOT DAY OR NIGHT, IT&#39;S RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH, THERE IS NO SPECIAL EVENT, IT&#39;S ALL SPECIAL. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO THE BEACH IN THIS STUFF, GO TO DINNER AND THEN GO OUT. IT REALLY IS CALIFORNIA. SINCE I&#39;VE TRAVELLED MORE, I SEE IT REALLY IS A UNIQUE THING. PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME &#39;I DIDN&#39;T EXPECT YOU TO BE FROM LOS ANGELES AND DO THESE KIND OF CLOTHES.&#39; [BELGIUM IS THE FIRST PLACE THAT SPRINGS TO MIND, NOT THE BEACH] BUT FOR ME THIS IS VERY LOS ANGELES.&quot; TODAY, THE DESIGNER IS AWAY FROM HIS ADOPTED HOMETOWN; INSTEAD HE&#39;S AT HIS SALES ROOM IN PARIS, IN A SIDE STREET A SHORT WAY FROM THE BUSTLE OF THE BASTILLE AREA. HE&#39;S AWAITING THE DELIVERY OF TWO GIGANTIC ELEPHANT SKULLS. LIKE YOU DO. ALTHOUGH, IN HIS MATTER-OF-FACT, DEADPAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN WAY, IT DOES SEEM TO BE A VERY &#39;LIKE YOU DO&#39; ACTIVITY. &quot;AND HERE THEY ARE, RIGHT ON CUE, THE SKULL DELIVERY. HA!&quot; HE BEAMS WITH GLEE AS TWO DELIVERY MEN STUMBLE THROUGH THE DOORS WITH THE REMAINS. WHERE DOES A PERSON FIND SUCH THINGS? THE ELEPHANTS&#39; GRAVEYARD? &quot;I SWORE THAT I WOULD NEVER TELL,&quot; SAYS OWENS, ONLY HALF JOKING. AND HE DOESN&#39;T. INSTEAD, HE ENTHUSIASTICALLY POINTS OUT THE SKULLS TO HIS BUYERS, MANY OF WHOM HE HAS A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH. THEY ARE NOT IN THE LEAST SURPRISED. LATER, HE WILL SAY THAT &quot;I WANT THERE TO BE ALLURE IN WHAT I DO - FOR ME THAT&#39;S WHAT FASHION IS ALL ABOUT,&quot; AND IN HIS OWN STRANGE, ELEGANT, YET JOKINGLY SELF-DEPRECATING WAY, RICK OWENS CERTAINLY HAS IT. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, OWENS&#39; PRESENCE AS A DESIGNER SEEMS TO HAVE COME OUT OF NOWHERE. IN FACT HE HAS BEEN PRODUCING COLLECTIONS UNDER HIS OWN NAME SINCE 1994. THIS, IN MAIN PART, IS DUE TO THE SUPPORT OF ANNA WINTOUR AND AMERICAN VOGUE, WHO WENT ON TO SPONSOR HIS FIRST FULLY FLEDGED CATWALK SHOW IN NEW YORK THIS FEBRUARY. HIGH COMMERCIAL PRAISE INDEED FOR THE MAN WITH THE SECRET SUPPLY OF ELEPHANT SKULLS. BUT PERHAPS THE PICTURE PAINTED SO FAR IS NOT ENTIRELY THE CORRECT ONE. IN THESE TIMES OF COMMERCIAL RESTRAINT WITHIN THE POST-SEPTEMBER 11 FASHION INDUSTRY, OWENS&#39; DESIGN FORMULA IS A WINNING ONE. DON&#39;T BE FOOLED BY ALL THE WEST COAST WEIRDNESS (BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, THERE IS A LOT OF THAT TOO), THE RICK OWENS&#39; AESTHETIC IS NOT ABOUT BEING &quot;AN ARTSYFARTSYFANCYPANTS&quot;. AS HE PUTS IT: &quot;THERE IS A PRAGMATISM WHICH MAKES MY DESIGN VERY AMERICAN. BUT IT&#39;S GOT A CERTAIN ROMANCE WHICH MAKES AMERICANS THINK OF EUROPE. MAYBE THAT IS THE RECIPE THAT WORKS.&quot; AND IT IS THIS RECIPE WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS SALES ROCKETING AND HIS STOCKISTS EXPANDING FROM EIGHT TO 90 STORES WORLDWIDE. N TURN, THERE IS A STRICT TECHNICAL UNDERPINNING TO WHAT THE DESIGNER DOES. RICK OWENS FORMALLY SPECIALISED IN PATTERN CUTTING, ARGUABLY THE MOST RIGOROUS AND DIFFICULT ELEMENT OF FASHION DESIGN. HE ALSO CITES HISTORICAL INFLUENCES SUCH A VIONNET, FORTUNY AND GRES, FAMED FOR THEIR SCULPTURAL APPROACH TO DESIGN FOR THE BODY. IT ALL ADDS UP TO A STRICT SUBTLETY AND QUIETNESS IN THE CLOTHING: THE ELEGANT ELONGATED FORMS, THE SUBDUED PALETTE, THE CONCENTRATION ON LUXURIOUS YET EXPERIMENTAL FABRICATION. MIXED TOGETHER WITH THE DOWN-AT-HEEL ATMOSPHERE OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD: SEE ALL OF THE ABOVE RUN OVER BY A STOLEN CAR. OR, AS HE SAYS, &quot;THERE IS SO MUCH STIMULATION IN THE WORLD THAT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THE ALTERNATIVE OF QUIET AND FAMILIARITY. NOT THE &#39;BEIGE RESERVE&#39; OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO PLAY IT SAFE, BUT THE PLACE YOU FIND WHEN YOU&#39;VE DONE ALL YOUR EXPLORING AND EXPERIMENTING. IT&#39;S THE CONTENTMENT OF SATISFYING A HEALTHY APPETITE AND THE LUXURY OF NOT CARING.&quot; ‘BEIGE RESERVE&#39; IS CERTAINLY NOT AN ACCUSATION EASILY LEVELLED AT THIS DESIGNER. HE&#39;S ALSO DONE HIS FAIR BIT OF &quot;EXPLORING AND EXPERIMENTING”. IT IS THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL/DISSIPATED APPEAL WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY COMES THROUGH IN THE CLOTHING. WITH A REFRESHINGLY UNGUARDED ATTITUDE, A HEALTHY SENSE OF HUMOUR AND THE LACK OF A CIRCLING PR, HERE ARE SOME OF RICK OWENS&#39; SECRETS TO HIS CURRENT SUCCESS. ON ENTERING THE FASHION INDUSTRY, HE IS FRANK: &quot;I JUST ALWAYS LIKED FASHION. I INITIALLY WENT TO LA TO GO TO ART SCHOOL. I DID PAINTING FOR TWO YEARS. THEN I NEEDED MONEY. YOU EITHER GET RICH AS A PAINTER OR YOU&#39;RE BROKE FOREVER. I THOUGHT I&#39;D BETTER DO SOMETHING I COULD MAKE SOME MONEY OFF OF, &#39;CAUSE THEM DIPTYQUE CANDLES DON&#39;T GROW ON TREES. SO I WENT INTO FASHION.&quot; WHICH LEADS TO WHERE HIS AESTHETIC INITIALLY CAME FROM: &quot;I WAS ANALYSING WHAT MY CLOTHES ARE ABOUT. YOU REMEMBER THAT MOVIE, GUMMO? THAT&#39;S KIND OF LIKE WHERE I GREW UP IN PORTERVILLE, MY TOWN IS VERY LIKE THAT. IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE A MADE-UP NAME. I USED TO HANG OUT AT THE RIVER WITH FRIENDS, WEARING CUT-OFF LEVI&#39;S AND LISTENING TO LYNARD SKYNARD AND LED ZEPPELIN, SMOKING POT AND DRINKING BEER. AT THE SAME TIME I WAS DISCOVERING FRENCH VOGUE, CLAUDE MONTANA AND THIERRY MUGLER. IT&#39;S ALMOST A BLEND OF THOSE SEPARATE THINGS, I WAS DEFINITELY INSPIRED BY THAT WHOLE GLAMOUR THING, BUT THERE ARE DEFINITE CUT-OFF LEVI&#39;S IN THERE. THERE&#39;S LYNARD SKYNARD AND MAHLER ALL AT THE SAME TIME.&quot; AND SO ONTO HIS CURRENT CHANGE IN FASHION FORTUNE: &quot;YES, PARTLY IT WAS BECAUSE ANNA WINTOUR STEPPED IN. BUT THERE WAS A POINT WHERE I STOPPED DRINKING AND DOING DRUGS, WHICH CHANGED EVERYTHING. I&#39;M NOT LIKE AN AAER AT ALL, I MEAN, I LOVED BEING A TOTAL ALCOHOLIC AND I WOULDN&#39;T CHANGE IT, I HAVE LOTS OF GOOD STORIES BECAUSE OF IT. IT WAS JUST TIME FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO HAPPEN, FOR ME TO CONCENTRATE ON THIS.&quot; AND THEN AS HE EXPANDS HIS THOUGHTS ON ANNA WINTOUR: &quot;EVERY TIME I SPEAK TO HER IT NEVER REALLY GOES SMOOTHLY. HOW DO YOU SAY &#39;THANK YOU&#39; WITHOUT BEING TOO GUSHY? SO IT&#39;S A LITTLE WEIRD. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE WAS THIS PARTY I WENT TO LAST FASHION WEEK IN NEW YORK - IT WAS A DINNER FOR NICOLAS GHESQUIERE - ANYWAY, I WAS AT THAT. SO, AT ONE POINT, KATE MOSS WALKS IN WEARING ONE OF MY OUTFITS. FROM ACROSS THE ROOM I CAN SEE ANNA WINTOUR BEHIND KATE MOSS, AND SHE GOES LIKE THIS [PUTS ON A BIG GRIN AND LIFTS BOTH THUMBS UP HIGH], WHICH I THOUGHT WAS REALLY ADORABLE AND GREAT. SHE&#39;S JUST NOT THE KIND OF PERSON YOU CAN IMAGINE DOING THAT, IS SHE? I SORT OF LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE SAW IT, AND THOUGHT &#39;WAS IT JUST ME OR WHAT?&#39;&quot; WHICH, IN TURN, LEADS TO HIS SHOOT WITH ANNIE LEIBOVITZ FOR AMERICAN VOGUE (BEAR WITH US HERE): &quot;DO YOU KNOW KEMBRA PFAHLER FROM THE BAND THE VOLUPTUOUS HORROR OF KAREN BLACK? SHE&#39;S THIS NEW YORK PUNK ROCK ICON AND ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS. SHE&#39;S INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL. HER LOOK IS ALL-BLUE BODY PAINT, HUGE HAIR AND HER TEETH ARE ALL BLACKED OUT WITH SILVER FOIL AND MARKER. SHE HAS THESE BLACK CAT EYES AND IS COMPLETELY SHAVED AND NAKED EXCEPT FOR THIGH-HIGH BOOTS. FOR THE FINALE OF HER SHOW SHE DOES TWO THINGS. THE FIRST IS THIS HANDSTAND, WHERE SHE SPREADS HER LEGS AND SOMEBODY CRACKS EGGS IN HER VAGINA. THAT&#39;S WHILE SHE&#39;S SINGING. THE SECOND IS CALLED THE &#39;WALL OF VAGINA&#39; WHERE ALL OF THE GIRLS IN THE BAND LIE FACE DOWN ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WITH THEIR LEGS SPREAD TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE. KEMBRA LIES ON TOP. THEN SOMEBODY COMES ALONG AND SQUIRTS YOGHURT INTO KEMBRA&#39;S TWAT AND IT DRIPS DOWN ONTO THE OTHER GIRLS AND THAT&#39;S CALLED THE &#39;WALL OF VAGINA&#39; [WITH A BROAD GRIN FINALLY GETTING TO THE POINT]. ANYWAY, IN THIS ANNIE LEIBOVITZ SHOOT FOR AMERICAN VOGUE, IT&#39;S ME AND KEMBRA - NO, THEY WOULDN&#39;T DO THE &#39;WALL OF VAGINA&#39; - THEY ASKED WHO I WANTED IN THE PICTURE AND I SAID KEMBRA, OF COURSE. SHE&#39;S SO GENIUS. SHE ALSO DOES THIS THING WHERE SHE SINGS THE THEME FROM TITANIC - MY HEART WILL GO ON - WHILE CRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE WITH BOWLING BALLS TAPED TO HER FEET.&quot; AND SO IT GOES ON. AND THERE&#39;S MUCH MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. AFTER ENTHUSING ABOUT THE &#39;WALL OF VAGINA&#39;, IT MIGHT SEEM ODD WHEN RICK OWENS PROCLAIMS: &quot;SOMETIMES I THINK MY CLOTHES HAVE AN ARMANI QUALITY TO THEM, WHERE ANYBODY CAN WEAR THEM. IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS THAT SIDE TO IT, IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO LIVE UP TO.&quot; BUT THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE ATTRACTION IN HIS CLOTHING: THERE&#39;S THE PERSONAL AND THE HUMAN ALONGSIDE THE BLUE-PAINTED PUNK ROCK. AS HE SAYS, &quot;THE CLASSICAL ALWAYS WORKS. GOING BACK TO PATTERN CUTTING AND THAT BASIS OF PRECISION, WHEN I WAS AT ART SCHOOL THEY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET ALL ABSTRACT ALMOST STRAIGHT AWAY. BUT A LOT OF THESE KIDS COULDN&#39;T REALLY DRAW, SO HOW COULD THEY DO THAT? IN ALL THINGS I FUNDAMENTALLY THINK YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE RULES TO KNOW HOW TO BREAK THEM.&quot; AND THIS SEEMS TO BE PRECISELY WHAT RICK OWENS IS DOING.

I DO BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO LIVE UP TO IT. CREATING AT A DESK UNDER A ROTHKO PRINT IS PROBABLY DIFFERENT THAN CREATING AT A DESK UNDER A REAL ROTHKO. NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW BUT STILL… AND DESIGNING A PHYSICAL SPACE IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT. I JUST WANT TO CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING AROUND MYSELF; BE IT SOMETHING I WEAR, SOMETHING I EAT WITH, SOMETHING I SIT ON, OR SOMETHING I EAT OFF OF. I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT IS AESTHETICS AND HOW MUCH IS EGO. I’M NOT GOING TO INDULGE MYSELF IN WORRYING ABOUT IT. I’LL INDULGE MYSELF IN IGNORING IT. LOOKING BACK ACROSS THE ARC OF YOUR CAREER, ARE THERE SPECIFIC SPATIAL AND MATERIAL CONDITIONS (I.E. YOUR LIVING SPACE[S], WORKSPACE[S], URBAN ENVIRONMENT[S]) THAT YOU CONSIDER TO HAVE IMPACTED OR BLED INTO YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS AND THE EVOLUTION OF YOUR AESTHETIC? I ALWAYS SAY MY RECIPE IS SUCH A DUMB SIMPLE CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLICHÉ — I WAS RAISED AN ONLY CHILD IN A VERY CONSERVATIVE HOUSEHOLD WITH NO TELEVISION, BUT AN EXTENSIVE LIBRARY. MY FATHER HAD ALL THE PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY BOOKS UPSTAIRS BUT IN THE BASEMENT HE KEPT HIS SECOND CHOICE SELECTION, WHICH INCLUDED BOOKS ON HOLLYWOOD’S SILENT SCREEN ERA. THE IMAGES IN THESE BOOKS REPRESENTED SUCH AN EXOTIC WORLD IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE SMALL UNIMAGINATIVE TOWN WE LIVED IN. CECILE B. DEMILLE’S BIBLICAL EPICS STOOD OUT THE MOST — ILLUSTRATING THE MORALITY I WAS LEARNING ABOUT EVERY DAY AT SCHOOL IN THE MOST GLAMOROUS WAY POSSIBLE. THE GENEROUS SCALE OF THE TEMPLES AND PALACES AND DESERTS WAS EXTRAVAGANT AND EXPANSIVE, THE CLOTHES WERE SUMPTUOUS AND OPULENT AND IMPRACTICALLY DRAGGING ON THE GROUND AND EVERYTHING WAS IN SHIMMERING BLACK AND WHITE THROUGH A 1920S ART DECO FILTER. SAINTS WERE SUFFERING AND SINNERS WERE SINNING AND CHRISTIANS WERE BEING DEVOURED BY LIONS. EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE COMES FROM THERE. YOU SPENT YOUR FORMATIVE YEARS IN LA: FROM YOUR TIME AT OTIS/LATT, WORKING IN A KOREAN REPRODUCTION FACTORY, YOUR EARLY WORK WITH MICHELE, ALL THROUGH ESTABLISHING YOUR OWN LINE. THESE STAGES SEEM TO RUN PARALLEL TO A LARGER ENERGY CURRENT PASSING THROUGHOUT THE CITY OVER THE SAME PERIOD: PUNK, RAVES, DRAG QUEENS, DRUGS, CRIME, POLICE BRUTALITY ETC. WERE THERE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS OR QUALITIES TO LA THAT PARTICULARLY FED YOUR SENSIBILITIES AND IMAGINATION? DO THESE CONDITIONS SEEM SINGULAR TO LA, IN THE SENSE THAT YOUR VISION WOULD HAVE EMERGED DIFFERENTLY IN ANY OTHER CITY? I THINK THE CONSTANT DELICIOUSNESS OF THE CLIMATE ON THE SKIN AND THE SCALE AND SPRAWL OF L.A. PUT EVERYTHING INTO A LANGUOROUS CONTEXT FOR ME. ISOLATED IN A CAR FOR LONG STRETCHES TO GET SOMEWHERE IS LIKE BEING IN A SMALL CAPSULE TRAVELING THROUGH A LARGE SPACE FEELING CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND UNTETHERED AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK THIS SENSE OF CONTROL AND FALSE CONTROL AND THE THREAT (OR APPEAL) OF LOSS OF CONTROL REALLY STAYED WITH ME. LOSS OF CONTROL ANGELES WERE THERE FIGURES AND MILIEUS THAT MADE A PARTICULAR MARK ON YOU DURING THESE YEARS, ON YOUR PERSONAL TRAJECTORY, AFFINITIES, AND AESTHETIC? I HAD 3 STAGES: 1980-1983 I ARRIVED IN LOS ANGELES TO GO TO OTIS/PARSONS ART INSTITUTE AS IT WAS CALLED AT THE TIME. I LIVED AT THE BRYSON APARTMENT BUILDING ON WILSHIRE AND RAMPART CLOSE TO MACARTHUR PARK. IT WAS A GRAND 1900S BEAUX ARTS BUILDING IN RUIN, WHICH PROBABLY SET THE TONE FOR THE REST OF MY L.A. LIFE. I WAS PRETTY GREEN AND INTROVERTED AND DIDN’T REALLY CIRCULATE THAT MUCH. AT NIGHT MY ROOMMATE AND I WOULD GO ROLLER SKATING ON AN ISOLATED STRETCH OF WILSHIRE BOULEVARD TO THE PARK WHICH WAS PRETTY ROUGH THEN. I THINK I WAS INVITING DANGER THAT NEVER REALLY TOOK UP THE BAIT. ROLLER SKATING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I WOULD DROOL OVER BULLOCKS WILSHIRE — AN OPULENT 1920S ART DECO FORTRESS OF A DEPARTMENT STORE THAT HAS SINCE BEEN TURNED INTO A LAW SCHOOL. AND ON THE HORIZON ACROSS THE PARK ONE COULD SEE THE TOWER OF THE EASTERN BUILDING, ANOTHER ART DECO MONUMENT IN A DISTINCT VERDIGRIS COLOR WITH A FRITZ LANG CROWN THAT LOOKED LIKE THE HUNGER TOWER MENTIONED IN DAVID BOWIE’S DIAMOND DOGS ALBUM I WAS LISTENING TO EVERY DAY THEN. THE ART THEORY CLASSES I WAS TAKING DISCOURAGED ME, I DIDN’T THINK I HAD THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA TO BE AN ARTIST SO I QUIT ART SCHOOL AND WENT TO TRADE TECH TO LEARN TO WORK IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. I GOT A 2 YEAR CERTIFICATE AND WORKED AS A PATTERNMAKER FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. 1982-1990 AT THIS POINT I HAD A CAR AND HAD MOVED TO HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, WHICH WOULD FRAME THE GELLING OF MY AESTHETIC. I LIVED ON GRACE AVENUE, A BLOCK ABOVE THE BOULEVARD IN A CRUMBLING MEDITERRANEAN STYLE BUNGALOW WITH A BEDROOM LINED IN A DECOMPOSING DARK GOLD BROCADE LIT WITH GLOOMY BLUE BARE LIGHT BULBS. I DROVE A BLACK T-TOP CAMARO THAT BLASTED WAGNER, SISTERS OF MERCY, AND MARLENE DIETRICH AND I WORE ALOT OF MAKEUP WITH LONG BLACK LEATHER GLOVES THAT I NEVER TOOK OFF. I WOULD HAUNT SLEAZY HUSTLER BARS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE THE SPOTLIGHT CLUB OR THE BLACKLIGHT AND END UP AT CRENSHAW CLUBS LIKE BLACK GAY DISCOS, JEWEL’S CATCH ONE, OR CLUB HORIZON FOR THE LESBIAN STRIPPER NIGHT IMMORTALIZED IN LEILAH WEINRAUB’S DOCUMENTERY SHAKEDOWN, AND THE SPANISH-SPEAKING DRAG SHOWS AT THE PLAZA SALON. THERE WERE ALSO THE PUNK ROCK BEER BUSTS AT A LEATHER BAR IN SILVERLAKE CALLED THE ONE WAY. I REALIZE NOW IT WAS THE MULTICULTURAL, MULTISEXUAL MILLEU I GRAVITATED TOWARDS AS OPPOSED TO THE AFFLUENT CELEBRITY PARTIES IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS OR THE SHINY GAY BARS IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. THEN I DISCOVERED THE GLAMOROUS DARKNESS OF SEX CLUBS WITH ROWS OF KNEELING PISS DRINKERS IN CONCRETE VAULTS AND SETTLED IN THERE FOR A WHILE. 1990-2001 AFTER WORKING IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY FOR A WHILE, I GOT A JOB WITH MICHELE LAMY, WHO DESIGNED CLOTHES AT THE TIME, FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND BEGAN MY LIFE AS A DESIGNER. SHE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO DEVELOPING RESTAURANTS THAT WERE HALF CULTURAL SALONS AND HALF NIGHTCLUBS AND I STARTED MY LABEL. WE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FROM MY OLD BACHELOR PAD TO A SERIES OF HIGH-CEILINGED STOREFRONTS ACROSS THE STREET FROM HER RESTAURANT THAT SHE HAD REPURPOSED OUT OF A DILAPIDATED CRAFTSMAN HOUSE. SHE CREATED A HIDDEN GARDEN FROM A PARKING LOT BEHIND IT AND WE HAD SEVERAL MAGICAL YEARS THERE. WE WERE BOTH STARTING NEW VENTURES TOGETHER IN THE WILDERNESS OF A PRE-GENTRIFIED HOLLYWOOD AND IT FELT DANGEROUS AND THRILLING AND PURPOSEFUL... THE PROPORTIONS OF THE CONCRETE STOREFRONTS WE LIVED IN WERE LONG AND HIGH, AND CURTAINED WITH GREY WOOL ARMY BLANKETS WHICH WE ALSO USED TO COMPLETELY INSULATE A BEDROOM. I USED THESE BLANKETS FOR MY FIRST FEW COLLECTIONS AND ADDED JACKETS MADE FROM USED DUFFLES AND PARACHUTES FROM THE ARMY SURPLUS WAREHOUSE DOWN THE STREET. OUR LIVES WERE CENTERED ON THE BOULEVARD AND OUR MAIN HEROES WERE JOSEPH BEUYS, LOUIS BOURGEOIS, AND PIERRE CHAREAU. AFTER MY LABEL STARTED MAKING MONEY, THE FIRST THING I DID WAS RENT A BLACK BABY GRAND PIANO FOR OUR LIVING SPACE ALTHOUGH NEITHER OF US COULD PLAY IT, AND LEASE A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR. BUT AFTER I STARTED MANUFACTURING IN EUROPE AND GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM ITALY TO LA, WE BOTH FELT LIKE STARTING A NEW ADVENTURE IN EUROPE AND JUST LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND. WHAT IS THE IMAGE OF LA THAT LINGERS IN YOUR REMEMBRANCE – SPRAWL, AN INFINITELY ENIGMATIC CITY IN ALL OF ITS DIVERSE CROSS-SECTIONS, OR MORE OF AN INTIMATE GEOGRAPHY, CONCENTRATED AROUND SPECIFIC PLACES/NEIGHBORHOODS? BOTH OF THOSE DESCRIPTIONS ARE EXACTLY WHAT ATTRACTS ME TO L.A. AT MY CURRENT AGE OF SIXTY. NOT THE UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES OF MY YOUTH, BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING AN ISOLATED AREA WITH ALOT OF SPACE AROUND IT WITH A METROPOLIS JUST BEYOND AT MY FINGERTIPS. BUT IF YOU ARE JUST ARRIVING, I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF PURPOSE… OTHERWISE WITHOUT AN ANCHOR YOU COULD JUST GET LOST… HOW DOES AN ARTIST BEGIN TO REDRESS ASPECTS OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS TO SIT IN LINE WITH AN INTUITION OR AFFINITY THEY’RE DRAWN TO THROUGH THEIR WORK? HOW DID THIS COME TO EXPRESSION IN THE SPACES YOU INHABITED AND APPROPRIATED DURING YOUR YEARS IN LA? IF YOU HAVE TO CALCULATE OR ANALYZE IT, MAYBE BEING AN ARTIST MIGHT NOT BE YOUR CALLING. IT NEEDS TO BE A RAGING DESIRE THAT YOU CAN’T CONTAIN. EXPRESSION NEEDS TO BE UNFORCED AND TRUE AND HONEST TO REALLY WORK — AT LEAST THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF CREATORS I AM DRAWN TO. WAS LA IN THE 80S AND 90S MORE CONDUCIVE – OR MORE RECEPTIVE – TO RADICAL IDEAS IN ART/CULTURE/FASHION? THINKING ABOUT LA TODAY, IN TERMS OF CULTURE AND AESTHETICS, ARE YOU ABLE TO DETECT UNDERCURRENTS WITHIN THIS PLACE THAT STILL RESONATE INSIDE YOUR WORK? I AM SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING AS INVENTIVE AS EVER IN THEIR OWN LITTLE CORNERS. I WAS ORIGINALLY ATTRACTED TO HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD FOR ITS LEGEND OF ARTIFICIALLY INVENTED GLAMOUR DURING THE 1920S AND 30S… AND ITS DESCENT INTO CORRUPTION AND DECAY LATER ON... I RECOGNIZE THAT I AM ROMANTICIZING AN UNFORTUNATE STORY BUT IT’S THE STORY OF LIFE — IDEALISM AND ITS INEVITABLE DEFEAT AND ITS REBIRTH.

WHERE AM I FINDING YOU RIGHT NOW? RICK OWENS: I&#39;M IN ITALY, AT THE FACTORY, BUT I&#39;M LEAVING TOMORROW MORNING FOR LOS ANGELES. I&#39;M GOING TO SEE (MY WIFE) MICHLE LAMY AND MY MOM AND MY DAUGHTER AND MY GRANDDAUGHTERS. DB: I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I WAS AWARE THAT RICK OWENS IS A GRANDPA. RO: I AM. IT&#39;S ONLY BEEN A YEAR, SO EVERYBODY IS LETTING IT SINK IN. DB: WITH EVERYTHING THAT&#39;S GOING ON IN THE WORLD, HAVE YOU MET YOUR GRAND KIDS BEFORE THIS TRIP? RO: ACTUALLY, I WAS THERE FOR BOTH BIRTHS. ONE WAS BORN IN ITALY, SO THAT WAS EASY, AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS BORN IN LA, WHEN THINGS HAD KIND OF OPENED UP, SO I WAS ABLE TO GO THERE TOO. DB: I WONDER IF A RICK OWENS KIDS LINE IS NEXT. RO: ACTUALLY, I JUST FINISHED A LITTLE COAT FOR THE ONE-YEAR-OLD, AND IT&#39;S IN PEARL-GRAY SHEARLING WITH MATCHING GOAT-HAIR FRINGE AND SILVER SEQUINED STRIPES ON THE SLEEVES. AND THE BABY GETS A — WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT? IT&#39;S LIKE A BABY BAG, YOU KNOW, THOY CALL IT A MARSUPIAL IN ITALIAN. DB: THAT&#39;S SWEET. RO: IT MATCHES — PEARL-GRAY SHEARLING WITH THE GOAT-HAIR FRINGE AND THE SILVER SEQUINS TOO. DB: PUT THOSE IN PRODUCTION, RICK! THESE BABIES HAVE TO START EARNING THEIR KEEP. RO: I RELEASED OUR GEOBASKETS (SHOES) IN BABY SIZES A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND THEY SOLD OUT. THEY REALLY WENT FAST. SO, MAYBE! DB: WE COULD TALK ABOUT BABIES ALL DAY BUT RIGHT NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW ART AND FASHION INTERSECT WITH WHAT YOU DO. RO: THEY PRESS THE SAME BUTTON SOMETIMES, IF YOU&#39;RE LUCKY. DB: I&#39;D SAY YOUR DESIGNS AND CERTAINLY YOUR SHOWS PUSH BOTH BUTTONS. RO: FOR OUR HOLIDAY PARTY LAST YEAR, THE WHOLE OFFICE TOOK A FIELD TRIP. WE GOT IN A BUS PLAYING LOUD DISCO AND DROVE TO LE BOURGET AIRPORT [OUTSIDE PARIS] TO GO SEE THE RICHARD SERRA EXHIBIT [AT THE GAGOSIAN GALLERY THERE]. THEN AFTER THAT, WE WENT TO SEE THE ALEX KATZ SHOW AT THADDAEUS ROPAC. IT WAS A REALLY FUN DAY. DB: GROWING UP, WERE YOU A KID WHO WAS DRAWN TO ART AND ARTISTS AND MUSEUMS? RO: I DIDN&#39;T GO TO MUSEUMS BECAUSE MY PARENTS WEREN&#39;T TRAVELERS. I LIVED IN A REALLY SMALL TOWN AND WE DIDN&#39;T CIRCULATE THAT MUCH. AS FAR AS WE EVER GOT WAS LOS ANGELES, THREE HOURS AWAY, AND WE MUST HAVE GONE TO THE LA COUNTY MUSEUM OR SOMETHING, BUT THAT WAS ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS OR SO. BUT MY DAD HAD A HUGE LIBRARY, WITH BOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY AND JAPANESE CALLIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE, AND THERE WERE MUSEUM BOOKS IN THERE TOO. MY DAD WAS A REALLY WEIRD CHARACTER, VERY PRAGMATIC AND BLUNT, LIKE A MILITANT CONSERVATIVE. HE HAD A GUN COLLECTION AND HE WAS FAIRLY RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC TOO. BUT HE ALSO HAD THIS TENDER SIDE. EVERY EVENING AFTER DINNER, HE&#39;D PUT ON A SILK KIMONO THAT HE&#39;D BROUGHT BACK FROM JAPAN WHEN HE WAS THERE DURING WORLD WAR II, MAKE TEA, LIE DOWN IN HIS MUSIC ROOM, LIGHT INCENSE, AND LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC FOR LIKE TWO HOURS. THAT&#39;S WHAT HE DID EVERY NIGHT. DB: REALLY? RO: YES! AND THE MUSIC FILLED THE HOUSE. AT FIRST I USED TO RESENT IT. I RESENTED THAT WE WERE FORCED TO BE PART OF HIS ROUTINE WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. BUT NOW CLASSICAL MUSIC IS A BIG PART OF MY LIFE. AND, UNKNOWINGLY, THAT&#39;S WHERE I LEARNED TO LOVE OPERA. DB: I THINK ALL KIDS RESENT THEIR PARENTS TO SOME EXTENT. RO: I REALLY RESENTED THAT I DIDN&#39;T GET TO WATCH TV LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. WE DIDN&#39;T HAVE A TV IN THE HOUSE. DB: NO TV AT ALL? RO: FINALLY, WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN, HE ALLOWED MOM AND ME TO HAVE A TV IN THE GARAGE, BUT WE HAD TO GO OUT THERE TO WATCH IT. DB: WOW. MY PARENTS DIDN&#39;T HAVE CABLE WHEN I WAS YOUNG, AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. RO: HA! AT LEAST YOU HAD A TV. YOU WERE SPOILED. DB: YOU ONCE TOLD ME THAT WHEN YOU GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, YOU WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST. IS THAT TRUE? RO: YEAH, I DID. I WENT TO OTIS-PARSONS IN LA, WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT TO MACARTHUR PARK IN THOSE DAYS, AND THAT&#39;S WHEN I BECAME EXPOSED TO ART THEORY. IT&#39;S WHERE I DISCOVERED JOSEPH BEUYS, WHO I CAN LOOK BACK TO NOW AND SAY MADE A HUGE IMPACT ON MY AESTHETIC CHOICES. BUT THERE WERE SOME TERRIBLY POMPOUS CLASSES THAT KIND OF INTIMIDATED ME, AND ULTIMATELY I DIDN&#39;T THINK I COULD BE A REAL ARTIST. SO I DROPPED OUT. DB: DID YOU WANT TO BE A PAINTER OR A SCULPTOR OR A PHOTOGRAPHER OR WHAT? RO: WHEN I STARTED, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE A PAINTER. I WAS DOING DAVID SALLE-INFLUENCED PAINTING, AND LOOKING BACK, DAVID SALLE AND JULIAN SCHNABEL WERE WHAT I WAS AIMING FOR—GRAND, GESTURAL, HEROIC, MONUMENTAL, RECKLESS, DRIPPY PAINTING. DB: AND THEN YOU ABANDONED IT? RO: YES. I WAS INTIMIDATED AND I FIGURED I NEEDED A SKILL AND A REAL JOB, SO I DECIDED TO GO TO A FASHION TRADE SCHOOL WHERE THEY TAUGHT YOU HOW TO WORK IN A FASHION FACTORY. TO BE CLEAR, IT&#39;S NOT LIKE I DREAMED OF ONE DAY BECOMING A BIG DESIGNER. I JUST THOUGHT, HERE&#39;S A SCHOOL I CAN AFFORD AND THIS ALL MAKES SENSE TO ME. I LEARNED PATTERN-MAKING AND HOW TO CONSTRUCT CLOTHES, AND THEN I GOT A JOB AS A PATTERN-MAKER AT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT FACTORIES, AND I ENDED UP DOING PATTERNS FOR MICHELE&#39;S COMPANY. THAT&#39;S HOW I MET MICHELE. DB: WHEN YOU TRANSITIONED FROM PAINTING TO FASHION, WAS IT A CONSCIOUS DECISION OR WERE YOU BASICALLY JUST LOOKING FOR A JOB? RO: NO, IT WAS CONSCIOUS. I WAS THINKING, ART IS TOO INTELLECTUALLY INTIMIDATING FOR ME. I THINK I CAN DO FASHION. DB: DO YOU STILL FEEL LIKE ART IS MORE INTELLECTUAL THAN FASHION? RO: NOT REALLY. I GUESS I CHANGED. BUT WITH ART, YOU GET TO INDULGE IN STRETCHING ONE CONCEPT OUT THROUGH A VERY LONG TIME. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, I REALIZED THAT FASHION IS ACTUALLY MORE RIGOROUS, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY TRY TO GET THE SAME AESTHETIC ATTENTION FROM PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO BE RELEVANT AND YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE TIMES IN A VERY SMART WAY. AND: YOU HAVE TO DO THIS FOUR TIMES A YEAR. YOU HAVE TO KEEP MAINTAINING THIS DIALOGUE WITH YOUR AUDIENCE AT A REALLY HIGH LEVEL, A HIGHER LEVEL THAN ART. YOU HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD AND CONVERSE WITH PEOPLE. OR DO YOU THINK I&#39;M OVERESTIMATING WHAT IT TAKES TO BE IN FASHION? DB: WELL, A FASHION DESIGNER CAN&#39;T JUST HIBERNATE FOR A FEW YEARS, LIKE SOME ARTISTS DO, AND COME BACK WITH A NEW IDEA WHEN THEY&#39;RE READY. RO: ABSOLUTELY NOT. SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING TO BE RESPONSIVE CONTINUOUSLY. AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK ART CAN BE MORE RIGOROUS THAN FASHION, MORE EXHAUSTING, IN OTHER WAYS. BUT ALL THINGS SAID, I&#39;M HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT TURNED OUT. DB: AS YOU MADE THIS CONSCIOUS SHIFT INTO FASHION, DID YOU MAKE INTENTIONAL PARALLELS BETWEEN WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER TRADITIONAL ART-WORLD STUFF AND WHAT YOUR FASHION-WORLD STUFF LOOKS LIKE? YOU&#39;VE MENTIONED BEUYS, WHO IS CLEARLY AN INSPIRATION IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, YOUR STORE AESTHETICS. RO: I RARELY LOOK AT CONTEMPORARY ART AND ABSORB IT INTO WHAT I DO BECAUSE WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I LOOK AT ART IS A COMPLETED CYCLE. MICHELE ALWAYS TELLS ME I&#39;M ONLY INTERESTED IN DEAD ARTISTS, AND I GO, YEAH, THAT&#39;S TRUE, BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE HOW THEY COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO THE SAME STANDARDS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES. I WANT TO SEE THE FINISHED STORY. I WANT TO SEE A LEGEND AND A FULL STORY. MY TOUCHSTONES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ARTISTS LIKE BEUYS. DB: YOU&#39;RE NOT INTERESTED IN ARTISTS JUST STARTING OUT? RO: IT&#39;S FUNNY, ALL THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT NFTS, WHICH I CAN&#39;T REALLY COMPLETELY GRASP MYSELF, MUST BE SIMILAR TO THE CONVERSATION IN THE 1970S WHEN LAND ART WAS EMERGING: IS IT VALID, HOW DO YOU OWN IT, WHAT DOES OWNING IT MEAN, IS IT REAL ART? SO IT&#39;S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE NFT THING IS GOING TO TURN OUT. DB: WOW, I&#39;VE NEVER HEARD SOMEONE COMPARE LAND ART TO NFTS. BUT I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE SKEPTICAL OR DISMISSIVE. RO: IT&#39;S ABOUT THE IDEA OF TAKING ART OUT OF ITS USUAL COMPARTMENT. TAKING IT OUT OF THE GALLERY AND PUTTING IT INTO AN EARTH PIECE IN NEVADA, LIKE MICHAEL HEIZER DOES, THAT MUST HAVE SEEMED RIDICULOUS AT THE TIME, OR AT LEAST HARD TO GRASP. DB: DO YOU OWN ANY NFTS? RO: NO. I DON&#39;T OWN THAT MUCH ART. I&#39;M NOT A COLLECTOR AT ALL. I HAVE A FEW THINGS THAT I&#39;VE WANTED SINCE I WAS YOUNG, AND I GOT THEM, AND THEN I DIDN&#39;T GET VERY MUCH MORE ACQUISITIVE THAN THAT. I&#39;M NOT IMPULSIVE AT ALL. I GUESS I&#39;M INSTINCTIVE, WHICH MOST COLLECTORS ARE, AND THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I&#39;VE MADE LEAPS OF FAITH THAT SEEMED IMPULSIVE, BUT THEY&#39;RE SO FAR AND FEW BETWEEN. DB: I KNOW THIS IS A BROAD QUESTION AND PROBABLY AN ANNOYING ONE FOR YOU TO ANSWER, BUT I&#39;M GOING TO ASK IT ANYWAY: WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ARTIST? RO: WELL, YEAH, THAT&#39;S A HARD ONE TO ANSWER, BECAUSE ART STILL HAS A MYSTICISM ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAT FASHION DOESN&#39;T. DB: OH, THAT&#39;S A GOOD ANSWER. RO: IT&#39;S HARD TO CREDIT YOURSELF WITH HAVING MORE OF A SHAMANISTIC, MYSTICAL ATTRIBUTE THAN A DESIGNER WOULD, SUPPOSEDLY. BUT AFTER EVERYTHING IS OVER, WHEN I LOOK BACK, MAYBE I&#39;LL SEE THE ARC OF MY WORK AS A WORK OF ART. AT THAT POINT I MIGHT CONSIDER IT ART, IF IT ALL COMES OUT OKAY. DB: I UNDERSTAND. RO: I&#39;M WATCHING KANYE [WEST) NOW, AND EVERYTHING HE&#39;S DOING, AND IT&#39;S ACTUALLY IMPRESSIVE: HIS LISTENING PARTIES, HIS PERSONAL BEHAVIOR WHERE HE&#39;S REALLY VOMITING OUT ANYTHING THAT COMES TO HIS MIND—IT&#39;S KIND OF LIKE HE&#39;S DOING MODERN COUTURE. HE&#39;S BEEN DOING HIS FASHION LINES AND EVERYTHING, BUT HE&#39;S LIVING HIS LIFE AS THIS COUTURE SHOW NOW. I MEAN, THOSE LISTENING PARTIES WERE MAGICAL HUGE EVENTS. THEY WERE RALLIES I AND THEN HE SATISFIES EVERYBODY&#39;S HUNGER FOR SPIRITUALITY WITH HIS SUNDAY SERVICES, WHICH BLEND EVERYTHING INCLUDING AESTHETICS, VALUES ABOUT CONNECTING, SPIRITUALITY. HE&#39;S PUTTING THAT ALL TOGETHER! WE&#39;RE ALL FASCINATED WITH HIS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM [KARDASHIAN) AND HOW THAT WORKS. IF WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT WHO&#39;S AN ARTIST, HE&#39;S KIND OF TURNED HIS LIFE INTO THIS PERFORMANCE THAT&#39;S REALLY IMPRESSIVE. YOU CAN&#39;T HELP BUT WONDER, WHAT&#39;S HE GOING TO DO NEXT? ONE DAY LAST YEAR HE SET FIRE TO HIMSELF IN A REBUILD OF HIS FAMILY HOME IN THIS HUGE STADIUM, WITH MARILYN MANSON WATCHING. WHAT&#39;S NEXT? DB: YOU KNOW, I&#39;VE CONDUCTED SO MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AROUND ART&#39;S AND ARTISTS&#39; INFLUENCE IN THE DESIGN SPACE, AND NO ONE&#39;S BROUGHT UP KANYE. BUT YOU&#39;VE MADE ME THINK ABOUT IT, AND, TOTALLY, ONE COULD SAY THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAS BECOME A PERFORMANCE. RO: AND THE PEOPLE HE&#39;S DRAWN INTO HIS ORBIT AND CONNECTED? EVERYTHING HE&#39;S INTERESTED IN IS PRETTY TOP NOTCH. HE&#39;S GOT EXQUISITE TASTE. I&#39;M MORE IMPRESSED THAN EVER! DB: EVEN IF YOU&#39;RE NOT COLLECTING CONTEMPORARY ART, DO YOU STILL SEEK IT OUT? ARE YOU INSPIRED BY IT? RO: TOTALLY! I TRY TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT COMES MY WAY. IT&#39;S THE BEST STUFF IN THE WORLD. I&#39;M NOT A NIGHTCLUB PERSON, I&#39;M NOT REALLY A PARTY PERSON, BUT MUSEUMS ARE MY SAFE CHURCH. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT MUSEUMS. I LOVE HOW SINISTER THEY ARE. I LOVE HOW THEY&#39;RE BUILT ON STEALING, LIES, SEX, WAR, CORRUPTION. BUT BEAUTY TOO! I MEAN, I LOVE ALL OF THAT. IT&#39;S JUST LIKE AN ORGY OF SALACIOUSNESS. DB: THAT&#39;S HUMANITY, I GUESS, EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID. THESE ARE ALL HUMAN INFLUENCES. RO: YES. BUT THERE&#39;S CORRUPTION IN A MUSEUM. A MUSEUM IS SO MUCH ABOUT CORRUPTION! DB: YOU MEAN BECAUSE WE&#39;RE FINALLY WRESTLING WITH THE FACT THAT A GREAT DEAL OF THE ART THAT&#39;S EXHIBITED IN MUSEUMS HAS BEEN PILLAGED OR LOOTED OR— RO: YES! I&#39;M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE POLITICS OF BUYING ART, I&#39;M THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, ABOUT HOW ALL OF IT HAS BEEN PILLAGED. I ACTUALLY SEE THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER, MORE THAN EVEN FIVE YEARS AGO. THERE SEEMS TO BE A VESTED INTEREST IN RETURNING WORKS OF ART TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS. YOU CAN&#39;T GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING NOW. EVERYTHING IS SO EXPOSED AND PEOPLE ARE SO INDIGNANT ABOUT EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING. DB: SEE, NOW YOU SOUND LIKE YOUR FATHER. ARE YOU WEARING A KIMONO? RO: YES! AND SIPPING MY JAPANESE TEA. DB: LISTENING TO CLASSICAL MUSIC AND BURNING SOME INCENSE. RO: WHICH I DO TOO. I MEAN, THAT&#39;S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. MAYBE IT&#39;S TRUE WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND EVENTUALLY WE ALL TURN INTO OUR PARENTS.

IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING HIS CLOTHING – WHICH PEOPLE HAVE, VARIOUSLY, AS MOODY, GOTHIC, BRUTAL – THE DEFINING FEATURE SEEMS ONLY TO BE A SENSE OF THE OTHERWORLDLY AND UNEXPECTED, PIECES STRAIGHT FROM A DREAM (OR, INDEED, NIGHTMARE). HIS MODELS MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER BODY STRAPPED, UPSIDE DOWN, ON THEIR FRONT; FACES TRANSFORMED WITH PROSTHESIS INTO HORN-SPROUTING ALIENS; BE WRAPPED IN TOWERING COCOONS OF FABRIC, RAISED UP ON SKY-HIGH PERSPEX HEELS. HIS COLLECTIONS ARE SHOWN EACH SEASON AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN PARIS, WHERE HE HAS ERECTED VAST SCAFFOLD STRUCTURES ON THE EXTERIOR – SOMETIMES ON FIRE, OTHER TIMES DISAPPEARING INTO CLOUDS OF FOG. IN SHORT, HE LIKES EXTREMES. OWENS SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME IN HIS PARIS RESIDENCE, THE CONVERTED FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS ON THE PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON WHICH HE PURCHASED IN 2004 WITH HIS WIFE, THE POLYMATHIC CREATIVE MICHÈLE LAMY. HE CALLS IT HIS ‘CONCRETE PALACE’, ‘INSULATED, ISOLATED, REMOVED, AND REMOTE’. SPEAKING FROM ITS TERRACE IN THE RUN-UP TO HIS S/S 2023 MEN’S COLLECTION – WHICH WILL BE SHOWN TODAY IN PARIS – OWENS INVITES WALLPAPER HOME. WALLPAPER: WHERE ARE YOU AT THE MOMENT AS WE SPEAK? WHAT CAN YOU SEE? RICK OWENS: I AM ON MY TERRACE IN PARIS OVERLOOKING THE GARDENS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE – THE ROSES ARE JUST STARTING TO BLOOM AND THE WISTERIA THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO STRUGGLE A BIT LOOKS LUSH AND CONFIDENT THIS SEASON. THERE ARE A FEW CONCRETE PRONGS FROM OUR FURNITURE COLLECTION LYING AROUND LIKE BRUTALIST BOULDERS AND THEY ENCIRCLE A CONCRETE HUMA BHABHA SCULPTURE THAT LOOKS LIKE A CONCRETE PORTAL TO ANOTHER WORLD. W: WHERE DO YOU CALL HOME? DESCRIBE YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD/AREA. RO: I HAVE LIVED IN A CONCRETE PALACE IN THE 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS FOR 15 YEARS – IT FEELS INSULATED, ISOLATED, REMOVED, AND REMOTE. THERE IS A RESERVE AND ALOOFNESS ON THIS SIDE OF TOWN THAT FEELS SLIGHTLY CHILLY AND AUSTERE. I’M INTO IT. ON MY WAY IN FROM THE AIRPORT, DRIVING THROUGH THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE, I LOVE THE GRANDEUR OF THE SETTING AND ITS CONTRAST TO THE SQUARE I LIVE ON JUST BEYOND IT. I ALWAYS FEEL A SOFT RUSH OF EMOTION DRIVING PAST THE GATES OF THE TUILERIES, PAST THE FOUNTAINS AND THE OBÉLISQUE, ENJOYING THE DELICIOUS CURLINESS OF PARISIAN CONFECTION BEFORE SLIDING INTO THE CONCRETE CAVE I LIVE IN. W: WHERE AND WHEN DO YOU FIND YOU ARE MOST PRODUCTIVE? RO: THERE IS ONE WEEKEND BEFORE EVERY COLLECTION WHEN I AM IN ITALY WITH THE FACTORY TO MYSELF AND GATHER ALL MY NOTES AND FABRICS AND FLOWERS AND CANDLES AND COOKIES AND MOVIES AND MUSIC AND SHUFFLE IT ALL TOGETHER AND PRINT IT OUT AND CUT AND TAPE AND STAPLE AND END UP WITH THE SEED OF A HINT OF A MOOD OF A COLLECTION. THIS IS WHAT I PRESENT TO THE TEAM THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AND THE COLLECTION EVOLVES FROM THERE. I HAVE AN APARTMENT ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE FACTORY AND FOLLOW A STRICT REGIMEN OF WORKING OUT, HAVING HIGH PROTEIN MEALS DELIVERED FROM OUR CANTEEN DOWNSTAIRS, AND REVIEWING THE PROGRESS OF THE COLLECTION EVERY MORNING ON THE TERRACE SMOTHERED IN JASMINE HARBOURING AT LEAST TWO ACTIVE BIRDS NESTS AT A TIME. W: WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON AT THE MOMENT? HOW IS IT GOING? RO: I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STAGE MY NEXT RUNWAY SHOW A MONTH AWAY. I HAD ORIGINALLY REACHED OUT TO AN ARTIST ON INSTAGRAM WHO TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A DISTORTED CREATURE COVERED IN PATCHY FUR TEETERING ON EXTENDED LEGS AND ARMS LIKE A STARVING GORILLA PAINTED BY SALVADOR DALÍ. I FIRST SAW A VIDEO POST OF HIM STAGGERING DOWN A SUBURBAN STREET WITH LONG GREASY HAIR COVERING A HAUNTING MASK-LIKE FACE AND WAS SMITTEN. HE EXUDED THE SAME GROTESQUE ALIEN GLAMOUR I HAD FIRST ENCOUNTERED ON BOWIE&#39;S DIAMOND DOGS ALBUM COVER IN THE SALES BIN IN THE BASEMENT OF THE KMART IN THE SMALL TOWN I GREW UP IN. I REACHED OUT TO THIS ARTIST AND ASKED HIM IF HE COULD BE REPRODUCED SO I COULD HAVE TEN CREATURES WALKING THE RUNWAY IN THE COLLECTION I ENVISIONED... I WOULD CREATE OVERSIZED BOMBERS AND SHIRTS TO FIT THE ANIMALISTIC BODIES AND PRODUCE THESE AS DISTORTED OVERSIZED GARMENTS THAT HAD BEEN REDESIGNED TO FIT HIS ALIENS. HE WAS INTO IT BUT SAID HE HAD ALREADY BEEN APPROACHED BY A PROMINENT SINGER TO APPEAR AS BACK-UP DURING A MUSIC FESTIVAL. I ASKED HIM: WASN’T THE PROSPECT OF HAVING TEN OF HIS CREATURES AS MODELS ON A PARISIAN RUNWAY MORE PRESTIGIOUS THAN TWO OF HIS CREATURES BEING DROWNED IN THE CHAOS OF A MUSIC FESTIVAL? APPARENTLY NOT – AT THE LAST MINUTE HE DROPPED ME AND LOOKED LIKE HE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME AT THE FESTIVAL. AFTERWARDS, I WONDERED IF IT WAS ALL FOR THE BEST SINCE USING THESE CREATURES MIGHT HAVE FELT TOO GIMMICKY. I AM CERTAINLY NOT ABOVE A GIMMICK BUT I HOPE I AM USING MY BOMBAST TO PROMOTE VALUES I BELIEVE IN – WOULD USING THESE CREATURES ILLUSTRATE MY CONSTANT UNDERLYING MESSAGE OF CONSIDERING OPTIONS OF BEAUTY OUTSIDE THE STRICTLY NARROW PARAMETERS OF THE GENERAL FASHION WORLD AND POPULAR CULTURE? IF I CAN BLUR THE LINES OF WHAT&#39;S CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE BEAUTY AND CELEBRATE THE MISFIT, MIGHT THAT SUPPORT ATTITUDES OF TOLERANCE AND INCLUSIVITY? W: WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE PLACE, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD? AND WHY? RO: MY CURRENT FAVOURITE PLACE IS A RUSTIC HOTEL IN LUXOR, EGYPT, WITHIN VIEW OF THE VALLEY OF KINGS. THE LANDSCAPE FEELS REMOTE AND UNTENDED AND THE ROADS GETTING TO IT ARE RAW AND UNPAVED. THE HOTEL ITSELF FEELS LIKE A DUSTY 1930S MOVIE SET WITH VAST HIGH-CEILINGED ROOMS AND SHAGGY DRY GARDENS AND A HUGE POOL. IT ALWAYS FEELS ABANDONED AND EMPTY WITH JUST THE BIRDS IN THE PALMS AROUND THE POOL AND ANCIENT TOMBS VISIBLE OFF IN THE DISTANCE. I LOVE FEELING THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF MYSELF AND MY CONCERNS IN THAT SCALE OF SPACE AND TIME. W: IF WALLPAPER CAME FOR DINNER, WHAT WOULD YOU COOK US? RO: I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE IN A KITCHEN, BUT WE HAVE A FANTASTIC CHEF THAT ALWAYS COMES UP WITH THE MOST DELICIOUS FARMERS MARKET FISH AND EXQUISITE SEASONAL VEGETABLE DISHES. AFTER THAT COME SLABS OF SLUTTY CHEESECAKE. W: WHAT ARE YOU READING, AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT? RO: I&#39;M READING A GAVIN LAMBERT BIOGRAPHY ON LINDSAY ANDERSON, ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE 1960S BRITISH NEW WAVE CINEMA – I ENJOYED LAMBERT’S BIOGRAPHY OF ALLA NAZIMOVA, THE SILENT SCREEN STAR WHO PRODUCED ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITE MOVIES, THE 1923 VERSION OF SALOME. LAMBERT’S BIOS ARE ALWAYS TITILLATING AND QUEER-CENTRIC AND I ENJOY STUDYING THE CREATIVE ARCS OF ECCENTRIC CREATORS HAVING MAINTAINED A COMPARATIVELY CONSISTENT OUTPUT OF CREATIVE EXPRESSION DESPITE LIFE’S DISTRACTIONS. I SUPPOSE IN A WAY I LIKE TO SEE HOW IT WAS DONE TO KEEP MYSELF ON COURSE IN MY OWN LITTLE WAY. W: WHAT’S YOUR FAVOURITE INDULGENCE AND WHY? WHEN DID YOU LAST INDULGE? RO: WHEN I’M AT THE ITALIAN FACTORY THERE ARE SO MANY PLACES TO VISIT NEARBY FOR A LITTLE AESTHETIC BOOST – LAST MONTH I STAYED AT THE VILLA FELTRINELLI IN LAGO DI GARDA, WHICH HAD BEEN MUSSOLINI&#39;S LAST RESIDENCE WHEN HE WAS CONFINED DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, WHERE I BATHED IN HIS BATHTUB. JUST DOWN THE LAKE IS IL VITTORIALE, WHERE GABRIELE D’ANNUNZIO LIVED, A FANTASTIC COMPOUND WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PERSONAL DISNEYLANDS. W: WHAT’S INSPIRING YOU RIGHT NOW? RO: I AM STUDYING THE WORK OF AUSTRIAN ARTIST WALTER PICHLER – HIS BLEAK BRUTALIST UTOPIAN EFFORTS AND 1960S CONCRETE FORMS AND EARTHWORKS ARE REALLY SPEAKING TO ME RIGHT NOW. MAYBE IT’S THE MELANCHOLY OF IDEALISTIC DREAMS HAVING FALLEN SHORT THAT I ALWAYS SEE IN RETROFUTURISM… W: WHAT’S TOP OF YOUR TO-DO LIST? RO: TOP OF MY LIST IS MAKING MY NEXT RUNWAY SHOW RELEVANT AND OF ENOUGH CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL VALUE TO OFFSET THE HYPERBOLE AND CONSUMERISM AND CARBON FOOTPRINT IT WILL BE PROMOTING. HOPEFULLY, THERE IS ENOUGH MORAL VALUE, ENTERTAINMENT, AND ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION THAT WILL MAKE THE WHOLE MESS WORTHWHILE. W: HOW DO YOU SWITCH OFF? DO YOU SWITCH OFF? RO: I HAVE TAKEN A ONE-AND-A-HALF HOUR NAP EVERY DAY FOR AT LEAST 15 YEARS – IT STARTED OUT AS A WAY OF WITHDRAWING FROM ALL THE NEW ENERGY DIRECTED MY WAY WHEN I STARTED PRODUCING MY COLLECTIONS IN ITALY, BUT I ALSO REALISE IT’S A FORM OF MEDITATION ALLOWING MYSELF TO EMPTY OUT CLUTTER IN MY HEAD AND HIT A REFRESH BUTTON THAT SERVES ME MUCH BETTER THAN PLAIN ENDURANCE. W: TEN YEARS FROM NOW YOU’LL BE… RO: I SEE MYSELF TOTTERING AROUND IN GOLD PYTHON PLATFORM CLOGS AND A BLACK SILK CHARMEUSE KAFTAN AND TURBAN IN A WALLED GARDEN DESIGNED AFTER VIOLET VENABLE&#39;S GARDEN IN SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER, PETTING AND WHISPERING TO THE ONAGADORI ROOSTERS I PLAN ON DEVOTING THE REST OF MY LIFE TO BREEDING.

HAD HE BEEN NARRATING THE SCENE OF WORSHIPPERS AT HIS SPRING/SUMMER 2023 MENSWEAR SHOW YESTERDAY AT PARIS’ PALAIS DE TOKYO, THE DESCRIPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPHETIC. THE VESTMENTS OF FANS OF RICK OWENS&#39; SIGNATURE BRUTALIST, EXTREME AESTHETIC ARE EASY TO SPOT: THE MEASURED STEPS OF A PERSON STRAPPED INTO HIS GARGANTUAN, VERTIGINOUS SPARTAN HEELS; THE MID-COITAL CLOTHING IN FULL MIDDAY SUN – BLACK LEATHER HARNESSES WORN WITH NOTHING BUT RIPPED JEANS, NUDE CORSETS AND SPANKS AS OUTERWEAR – GROUPS OF YOUNG MEN PARTNERING HILLBILLY HAIRCUTS WITH HALTER DRESSES AND RIPPED, SINEWY MALE TORSOS CASCADED OVER BY LONG, ANGELIC HAIR. OWENS&#39; ENTHUSIASTS, LIKE THE DESIGNER HIMSELF, DON’T DO THINGS IN HALF MEASURES. FAR BEYOND A SINGLE PIECE, THEY’LL COMMIT TO AN ENTIRE WARDROBE FROM THE DESIGNER. THE NEW COLLECTION – ENTITLED “EDFU,” AFTER THE EGYPTIAN TEMPLE – WAS INSPIRED BY OWENS&#39; RECENT TRIP TO EGYPT, FEELING SMALL IN THE GRAND SPACE OF HISTORY AND THE WEIGHT OF HISTORICAL EVENTS IN PROGRESS. HARDWARE WAS MUTED BUT VOLUME ON SHAPES WAS TURNED UP ALL THE WAY, EXAGGERATED AND OVERBLOWN. IT SHOT UP FROM THE SHOULDERS IN DOMED, BAT WING-ESQUE PEAKS AND PUDDLED AROUND THE ANKLES, TWISTING IN CURRENTS THAT DRAGGED THE FABRIC AROUND THE CALVES. RIPSTOP NYLONS FLOATED AURA-LIKE AROUND THE BODY, AS DID FLY PROOF ROBES WITH GAUZY, FACE-COVERING HOODS LAYERED OVER FLOOR-SWEEPING SILK SHIRTS. THE COLLECTION WAS PUNCTUATED BY “APPARITION LEATHER” – JEANS, JACKETS AND SHIRTS MADE FROM AIR-DRIED COW LEATHER TREATED WITH GLYCERINE TO GIVE IT A TRANSPARENT FINISH. ARCHIVE FAVORITES LIKE FW22’S MULTIPLE ARMHOLE SWEATERS WERE WHITTLED DOWN TO RIB TANKS AND THEN FURTHER STILL, TO THE BINDING THAT FINISHES THE GARMENTS EDGES. BOXY-SHOULDERED TAILORING AND CINCHED WAISTS IN BLACK AND NEUTRALS WERE OFFSET BY SHOCKS OF YELLOW SNAKESKIN, SHIMMERING, IRIDESCENT CARGO FLARES, AND A VEST REALIZED IN SWOLLEN SCALES THE SIZE OF SOME PREHISTORIC FISH. IT’S A RADICAL AND ANTAGONISTIC STYLE OF LUXURY THAT OWENS HAS HONED SINCE HE LAUNCHED HIS NAMESAKE LINE IN LOS ANGELES IN 1994. BORN AND RAISED IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, OWENS RELOCATED TO PARIS IN 2003 WITH HIS CO-FOUNDING PARTNER/MANAGING DIRECTOR ART/FURNITURE AT OWENSCORP AND THE FAMOUS ART- AND FASHION-WORLD FIGURE MICHÈLE LAMY. THE BRAND REMAINS INDEPENDENT AT A TIME WHEN FEW OF ITS HERITAGE DO, FACILITATING OWENS&#39; ABILITY TO COLLABORATE ON PROJECTS THAT EXTRUDE HIS CREATIVE VISION FROM SKINCARE AND FRAGRANCE WITH AESOP TO STREETWEAR WITH CHAMPION, FOOTWEAR WITH CONVERSE AND DR. MARTENS AND, MOST RECENTLY, PENTAGRAM PANTIES FOR HIGHSNOBIETY’S NOT IN PARIS POP-UP. AT THE SHOW, THREE GIANT GLOBES WERE SET ABLAZE AND AIR-LIFTED BY A CRANE TO BE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY INTO THE FOUNTAIN POOL OF THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN TIME TO A THROBBING, GROWLING SOUNDTRACK. IT WAS A NOD TO THE EGYPTIAN GOD HORUS, WHO REPRESENTS THE TRIUMPH OF GOOD OVER EVIL, REALIZED AS A CARVING OF A WINGED SUN OVER THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE TEMPLE OF EDFU, THE SUN CRASHING INTO THE GROUND OVER AND OVER FOR INFINITY. NO STRANGER TO SPECTACLE, OWENS&#39; SHOWS POSSESS AN UNBRIDLED ENERGY THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS INCENDIARY. CONSIDER HIS FW15 MEN’S PRESENTATION, WHERE HIS MODELS WORE TUNIC DRESSES WITHOUT UNDERWEAR, GIVING THE AUDIENCE AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW OF THEIR GENITALIA. FOR SS14, HE ENLISTED AN ASSEMBLY OF STEP DANCERS FROM LOCAL SORORITIES, EMBRACING BODY TYPES THE FASHION WORLD HADN’T MUCH SEEN ON THE RUNWAY AT THE TIME. THERE WAS THE ESTONIAN HEAVY-METAL OUTFIT, WINNY PUHH, IN WRESTLING GEAR, WHO PLAYED SUSPENDED UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE CEILING FOR SS14 AND, PERHAPS MOST NOTORIOUSLY, THE HUMAN BACKPACKS OF SS16. IT&#39;S AN ENERGY THAT PERMEATES, EVIDENCED BY THE CROWDS OF KIDS STANDING OUTSIDE HIS SHOW, MOUNTING BUS STOP SHELTERS JUST TO GET A GLIMPSE. FOR A DESIGNER SO OFTEN CALLED THE “LORD OF DARKNESS,” SEEING HIS SHOWS IS AN EXHILARATING EXPERIENCE THAT LEAVES CHILLS ON A SCORCHING SUMMER DAY, SAT NEXT TO THREE BURNING GLOBES. VIA EMAIL, DAYS BEFORE HIS PARIS SHOW, RICK OWENS EMPLOYS HIS SIGNATURE ALL-CAPS AUTOGRAPHY TO TALK DEFINING MOMENTS, GUTTER GLITTER, AND HIS STEADY-ROLLING SCOTCH-TAPE SPIRIT. HOW DID YOU FIRST COME TO FASHION? WAS THERE AN EPIPHANY THAT SET YOU OFF? LOOKING BACK I DON&#39;T REALLY KNOW WHY I THOUGHT I COULD BE A DESIGNER. I ALWAYS TELL THE STORY OF CHOOSING FASHION AFTER 2 YEARS OF ART SCHOOL BECAUSE I DIDN&#39;T THINK I HAD THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA TO BE AN ARTIST - BUT I THOUGHT I MIGHT MANAGE TO GET A JOB IN FASHION IF I ACQUIRED A MARKETABLE SKILL LIKE PATTERN MAKING... SO FASHION WAS ACTUALLY MY PRACTICAL PLAN B. FROM PORTERVILLE TO PARIS, HOW DO BOTH TOWNS INFLUENCE YOU CREATIVELY? I LOVED THE AESTHETIC DENSITY OF PARIS AND HAD THE ARROGANCE TO THINK I COULD INHALE AND THEN SIMPLIFY IT - THE HISTORY OF THE BELLE EPOQUE SLITHERING INTO ART NOUVEAU CALCIFYING INTO ART DECO... NAIVELY SUMMARIZED BY ME WITH SOME BIAS T-SHIRTS AND LEATHER RAGS. I THINK THE RAW DIRT OF A SMALL TOWN IN CONTRAST TO THE ARCH ARTIFICE OF PARIS KIND OF BECAME MY SCHTICK. YOU’VE SAID THAT YOU ARE “DRAWN TO PRE-GENTRIFIED HOLLYWOOD.” WHAT WAS THAT TIME FOR YOU? I LIVED OFF OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD WHICH HAD THE GRITTY GLAMOROUS SLEAZE A SMALL TOWN BOY LIKE ME WAS LOOKING FOR - I WANTED TO ROLL IN GUTTER GLITTER. THERE WERE THE PUNK ROCK BOYS AT THE LEATHER BAR BEER BUSTS, THE FLOATING CLUBS IN ABANDONED DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS, THE BLACK GAY DISCOS ON CRENSHAW AND THE SPANISH SPEAKING DRAG SHOWS ON LABREA BOULEVARD. WE DIDN&#39;T TAKE PICTURES THEN BUT I REMEMBER BEING TORTURED AND POETIC AND RECKLESS AND DRAMATIC AND MAYBE HOT FOR A MINUTE. IF YOU HAD TO CONSIDER YOUR “FIRST WORK”, THE NUMBER ONE PIECE THAT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR BODY OF WORK, WHAT WOULD THAT BE? I DID A SHRUNKEN LEATHER JACKET WITH RIB INSERTS IN THE SLEEVES WITH A HIGH ARMHOLE TO MAKE THE ARMS AS LONG AND SKINNY AS POSSIBLE. THAT JACKET GOT ME STARTED AND WAS KNOCKED OFF EVERYWHERE I LOOKED - I ENDED UP SEEING IT ON COMMUTERS IN METROS OF FOREIGN CITIES I WOULD VISIT AND I JUST MARVELED AT HOW I HAD INFECTED THE WORLD WITH SOMETHING IN MY OWN TINY WAY. I WAS AND AM ALWAYS ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED WHEN I SEE A KNOCKOFF. DO YOU REMEMBER THE MOMENT, OR SERIES OF MOMENTS, THAT DEFINED YOUR AESTHETIC? I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT GRASPING AT THE EXOTICISM OF CATHOLIC IMAGERY AND PAGEANTRY AT THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL I WENT TO IN THE TINY CONSERVATIVE JUDGEMENTAL TOWN I GREW UP IN. SAINTS AND SINNERS IN DRAGGING ROBES IN DUSTY TEMPLES LOOKING FOR REDEMPTION AND TRANSCENDENCE AND FINAL BLOODY RECKONINGS... I STARED AT A HOT LONG-HAIRED GUY DYING ON A CROSS EVERY DAY FOR YEARS. ARE THERE ANY PROJECTS OUTSIDE OF THE FASHION AND FURNITURE WORLD THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON? YOU&#39;RE ASKING ABOUT FASHION AND COMMERCE - BUT ACTUALLY I OFTEN THINK ABOUT CULTIVATING AN IRIS GARDEN SO I RECENTLY ACQUIRED A SPACE NEAR MY FACTORY TO DEVELOP ONE. WHEN I WAS A KID, I REMEMBER MY ART CLASS MAKING A FIELD TRIP TO SOMEONE&#39;S PRIVATE IRIS GARDEN AND I REMEMBER A FIELD OF DIFFERENT STRAINS OF IRIS PLANTED IN DIRT ROWS WITH FURROWS BETWEEN THEM TO CONTROL WATERING. THERE WERE CRESTED IRIS, DUTCH IRIS, JAPANESE IRIS, SIBERIAN IRIS, BUT THE BEARDED IRIS WERE MY FAVORITES - THERE WERE ALL COLORS AND SIZES WITH SCULPTURAL BLOSSOMS WITH HANGING PETALS WITH ALL DEGREES OF FRILLINESS AND FRINGE... MORE COMPLEX AND BIZARRE THAN ORCHIDS... LATER WHEN I DISCOVERED KOLOMAN MOSER&#39;S ILLUSTRATION FOR AN ARNO HOLZ POEM OF A WOMAN TRANSFORMING INTO AN IRIS LIKE RIPLEY’S MUTANT CLONE IN ALIEN, I KEPT THAT ASSOCIATION IN MY HEAD AND IT STRUCK JUST THE RIGHT NOTE OF BEAUTY AND THE GROTESQUE THAT HAS ALWAYS APPEALED TO ME... AND THERE ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF FLOWERS IN OCTAVE MIRBEAU’S BOOK THE TORTURE GARDEN THAT COULD EASILY BE SPEAKING OF IRISES... WHAT ARE SOME OF THE REFERENCES YOU KEPT AT THE FOREFRONT OF YOUR MIND WHEN DESIGNING THIS COLLECTION? WE HAVE ALL BEEN SO DISTURBED BY THE WAR AND CONSTANT ONLINE STONE-THROWING, I WANTED TO PROPOSE SOME ORDER AND DISCIPLINE... I USED SOME RIPSTOP NYLONS THAT HAD A BUTTERFLY WING LIGHTNESS WITH GRAPH LIKE CONSTRUCTIONS THAT LENT SUBTLE SOOTHING GRIDDED PATTERNS TO THE CLOTHES. I REDUCED HARDWARE AND VISIBLE CLOSURES TO KEEP THINGS QUIET. I WANTED SIMPLICITY, BUT I STILL WANTED EXAGGERATED SHAPES TO MOCK ALL THE RULES AND BIGOTRY THAT CREATE SO MUCH CONFLICT IN THE WORLD. I HAD RECENTLY RETREATED TO EGYPT WHERE I FOUND GREAT COMFORT IN THE REMOTENESS AND SCALE OF HISTORY. MY PERSONAL CONCERNS AND GLOBAL DISCOMFORTS FELT PETTY IN THE FACE OF THAT KIND OF TIMELESSNESS. LYING DOWN IN THE DIRT WITH THE VALLEY OF KINGS WITHIN VIEW IS A PERSPECTIVE I LIKED. I ALSO LIKE THE ARTIFICIAL EGYPT INVOKED IN THE SILENT BLACK AND WHITE MOVIES THAT WERE PRODUCED AROUND THE SAME TIME AS THE DISCOVERY OF KING TUTANKHAMUN&#39;S TOMB - MYSTERIOUS BIBLICAL EXOTICISM SEEN THROUGH A 1920S ART DECO FILTER. THIS VERSION OF EGYPT THEN REEMERGED IN THE 1970S ADOPTING THE 1920S VERSION OF EGYPT IN A CAMP WAY. ARE CREATIVE ROADBLOCKS SOMETHING YOU EXPERIENCE? IF SO, HOW DO YOU CIRCUMNAVIGATE THEM? MY CREATIVE PROCESS IS A STEADY ROLLING-ALONG EXERCISE. I GATHER AND REARRANGE MY THOUGHTS EVERY DAY AND EXAMINE THEM FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES - I STUDY MY PAST WORK - I STUDY THE PAST WORK OF MASTERS - WHEN THE TIME COMES TO LAUNCH A COLLECTION, I JUST UNTANGLE A BALL OF IDEAS AND EDIT, EDIT, EDIT. MY GREATEST STRENGTH MIGHT BE IN REDUCTION - FINDING THE STRAIGHTEST LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B. IT&#39;S ALSO MY GREATEST WEAKNESS, SOMETIMES LEAVING ME IMPATIENT WITH THE PROCESS AND THE PLEASURE OF WANDERING. IT&#39;S A FANTASY OF CONTROL WHICH I RECOGNIZE AS JUST THAT - FANTASY. BUT IN MY CASE, FAIRLY HARMLESS. YOUR RELEASES ARE WRITTEN BY YOU AND ARE INCREDIBLY EVOCATIVE. WHO ARE SOME WRITERS THAT HAVE INFLUENCED YOU OR THAT YOU ADMIRE? WHAT IS A BOOK YOU FIND YOURSELF RECOMMENDING TO PEOPLE OVER AND OVER? WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO WRITING?? I REMEMBER IN THE PAST ENJOYING READING COLETTE - BEFORE I HAD EVER EVEN CONSIDERED VISITING PARIS... THERE WAS A SENSIBLE BUT GRACEFUL LOGIC TO HER WRITING IN A GLAMOROUSLY FOREIGN (FOR ME AT THE TIME) SETTING THAT REGISTERED WITH ME - THEN I WENT THROUGH A DECADENT PHASE WITH HUYSMANS, BAUDELAIRE, MALLARME, AND THE AFOREMENTIONED MIRBEAU. I WANTED BIG DRIPPING GLOBS OF OVERWROUGHT ARTIFICE. WHEN I SHIFTED GEARS AND STARTED MANUFACTURING IN ITALY I STOPPED READING FOR A LONG TIME - I FELT MY TIME FOR ABSORBING WAS OVER AND IT WAS NOW MY TIME TO EXPRESS. BUT IN THE PAST RECENT YEARS I HAVE BEEN READING BIOGRAPHIES AND I NOW REALIZE I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW CREATORS NEGOTIATED THEIR LIVES... WHO MAINTAINED THEIR CREATIVE STANDARDS AND WHO DIDN&#39;T - I REALIZE I AM TRYING TO LEARN HOW IT WAS DONE. MY FAVORITE BIOGRAPHER IS JOHN RICHARDSON FOR HIS PERCEPTIVE BUT DELICIOUSLY B TCHY INSIGHTS INTO THE LIVES OF PICASSO, THE SITWELLS, ANAIS NIN, PEGGY GUGGENHEIM, AND OTHERS. FOR FROTHY WHIPPED CREAM DESSERT, I READ 1930S GARDENING BOOKS BY BEVERLEY NICHOLS - THIS SERIES OF BOOKS OSTENSIBLY OBSERVES HIS GARDENING EXPERIENCES OVER THE YEARS BUT IN FACT OBSERVES THE QUIRKS AND ECCENTRICITIES OF VILLAGE CHARACTERS ALONG THE WAY THAT IS GRACIOUS, OFTEN SUDDENLY DEEPLY MOVING AND THEN FUNNY AS F CK... AND THE ADVENTURES OF MAPP AND LUCIA BY E. F. BENSON HITS A SIMILAR NOTE AND RECOMMENDING IT IS ONE OF THE BEST GIFTS I KNOW. YOU’VE MENTIONED A “SCOTCH TAPE SPIRIT” TO THE ORIGINS OF YOUR BRAND. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I&#39;VE ALWAYS LIKED THE SPONTANEITY AND RESOURCEFULNESS OF IMPROVISING WITH WHATEVER IS AT HAND - AN ARTE POVERA APPROACH. THERE IS AN ITALIAN PHRASE THAT TRANSLATES TO &quot;OVERLY LICKED,” SOMETHING I TRY TO AVOID - THERE EXISTS A MANUFACTURED STANDARD OF BEAUTY THAT FEELS SO NARROWLY RESTRICTIVE AND CRUEL, I HAVE STARTED REFERRING TO IT AS THE AIRPORT AESTHETIC - ALL THE LAYERS OF MANIPULATIVELY CALCULATING PERFUME ADS WITH THE SAME ASPIRATIONAL VALUES OF SEX AND PRIVILEGE THAT KIND OF DEPRESS ME A BIT. YOU’VE COLLABORATED ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND INDUSTRIES. HOW DO YOU LIKE TO WORK WITH YOUR COLLABORATORS? WHAT DRAWS YOU TO A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT? I HAD ORIGINALLY AVOIDED ENTERING INTO WHAT I CONSIDERED EXERCISES IN PHONY HYPE AND WHILE I DON&#39;T PRETEND TO BE OBLIVIOUS TO THE ADVANTAGES OF EXPOSURE, OPENING UP MY INSULAR LITTLE WORLD TO NEW PEOPLE TURNED OUT TO BE A NEW WAY OF HAVING FUN. I LIKE THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY AND COOPERATION AND FINDING NEW RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS. I HAD PROTECTED MY IDENTITY FOR SO LONG, ONCE I FELT IT WAS ESTABLISHED, I WAS READY TO PLAY. I LIKE EXPLORING MORE RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION METHODS WITH BIGGER BRANDS THAT ARE CHANGING THE WAYS THEY OPERATE THE SAME WAY I AM CHANGING THE FACTORY I BOUGHT THAT HAD SYSTEMS SET IN PLACE YEARS BEFORE I ARRIVED. YOU CAN’T BECOME RESPONSIBLE OVERNIGHT AND UPSET A DELICATE BALANCE OF SUCCESS - BUT LIKE I SAY ON ALL MY CONTENTS LABELS, WE CAN ALL AIM HIGHER AND WE CAN ALL START SOMEWHERE. ON THESE CONTENTS LABELS, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS A LOT MORE INFORMATION ON FABRIC CONTENTS AND RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION TRANSPARENCY. NOT SAYING WE ARE COMPLETELY THERE BUT WE ARE IMPROVING DAY BY DAY. WHEN, DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS, WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE SURPRISED? I AM CONSTANTLY SURPRISED SAMPLES TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY THAN EXPECTED AND CAN LEAD YOU IN ANOTHER DIRECTION - OR AN IDEA THAT SEEMED WEAK CAN TURN OUT TO BE A FEATURED ELEMENT IN A COLLECTION - A WHIM CAN TURN INTO SOLID INSPIRATION. SEEING IDEAS BECOME REALITIES ARE LIKE CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY.

MAYBE.’ — SPRING SUMMER 2022 ISSUE 19 — BY TIM BLANKS FEW FASHION DESIGNERS HAVE SO SUCCESSFULLY CREATED A WORLD AS FIERCELY IDIOSYNCRATIC AS RICK OWENS’. SERVING UP DARK, RIOTOUS GLAMOUR AND CHALLENGING ORTHODOXY ARE HIS LINE OF BUSINESS – AND HE’S BEEN DOING IT MAJESTICALLY FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS. TODAY, OWENSCORP, THE INCONGRUOUSLY CORPORATE-SOUNDING BUSINESS HE AND HIS LONGTIME PARTNER MICHÈLE LAMY HAVE BUILT, GENERATES ANNUAL REVENUE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. ALONG THE WAY, HE’S ATTRACTED THE KIND OF DEVOTED (READ: OBSESSIVE) GLOBAL FOLLOWING MORE COMMONLY RESERVED FOR SCALED-UP CULTISH POP STARS. TO HIS FANS, OWENS’S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS, CULTURAL TASTES, AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES (PSYCHEDELICS, ENTHUSIASTIC CLUBBING, COMMITTED BODY TRANSFORMATION) OFFER A KIND OF PORTAL INTO AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING WORLD. BUYING HIS CLOTHES, IT SEEMS, IS THE ENTRY-LEVEL TICKET TO EXPLORING IT. NOW AGED 60, RICK OWENS SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. AU CONTRAIRE. HIS RECENT SHOWS AND COLLECTIONS – BOTH DURING AND SINCE THE PANDEMIC – HAVE ARGUABLY BEEN HIS MOST MASTERFUL, MOST EMOTIONALLY CHARGED, AND, AT TIMES, MOST CONVENTIONALLY (AND DELIBERATELY) BEAUTIFUL. WITH ALL THIS SWIRLING IN OUR MINDS, SYSTEM WAS KEEN TO HAVE A CLOSER LOOK INSIDE THE RICK OWENS STORY, AND TAKE STOCK OF THE SOMETIMES TURBULENT RISE, ENDURING AESTHETIC, AND ENDEARING HONESTY THAT ARE PART OF HIS OTHERWISE GURU-LIKE PRESENCE. WHO BETTER THAN CONFESSIONAL CONVERSATIONALIST TIM BLANKS TO SPEND THE DAY IN PARIS IN RICK’S INTOXICATING COMPANY? THEY DISCUSSED LIFE AND DEATH, FRIENDSHIPS AND FAMILY, KINKS AND CONQUESTS, MOTHERS AND MUSES. THE FOLLOWING DAY, OWENS JETTED OUT TO THE CONCORDIA BASE OF OWENSCORP TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED BY JUERGEN TELLER, BEFORE TELLER AND STYLIST JODIE BARNES CAPTURED AN ENSEMBLE CAST OF OWENSIAN BEAUTIES WHO SHOWCASE THE DESIGNER’S RECENT-ERA COLLECTION ARCHIVES. FINALLY, WE INVITED A DOZEN OF OWENS’S MOST FERVENT FOLLOWERS TO SWAP STORIES AND ASK HIM THEIR QUESTIONS. ‘RICK’S LIKE A CHAMELEON IN PURSUIT OF BEAUTY,’ SAYS SUPERFAN MATT CAMPO. ‘HE IMBUES HIS CLOTHES WITH UNDENIABLE EGO AND BRASHNESS, BUT ALSO GENUINE SINCERITY AND WARMTH.’ REFLECTING ON HIS OWN TRAJECTORY AND SUCCESS, RICK IS HUMBLE, GRATEFUL, GODLIKE: ‘I SENT OUT A MESSAGE AND PEOPLE RESPONDED. THAT IS THE BEST YOU CAN ASK FOR IN LIFE.’ RICK OWENS IS WORRIED WE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. ‘MY STORY IS PRETTY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. IT IS NOT OVERLY COMPLEX AND I HAVE TRIED TO BE DIRECT ABOUT IT, AND I DON’T OVERANALYSE THINGS, SO EVERYTHING I SAY WILL BE A REPEAT OF SOMETHING I HAVE ALREADY SAID TO YOU.’ IT’S NOT TRUE, OF COURSE. ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT DROLL SELF-DEPRECATION IS SOMETHING OF A DEFAULT POSITION FOR OWENS, IT’S A SIMPLE TRUTH THAT THE MAN’S LIFE AND WORK ARE NO OPEN BOOK, WHATEVER HE SAYS. THEY UNFOLD LIKE A LOTUS, SOMETIMES MYSTIFYING, ALWAYS FASCINATING. HE WONDERS WHAT HE WOULD WANT TO READ ABOUT HIMSELF, THEN, IN A FLASH, ANSWERS HIS OWN QUESTION: ‘I WOULD WANT TO READ GOSSIP.’ AND RICK HAS GIVEN FASHION TATTLETALES SOMETHING TO TWITTER ABOUT OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. HE AND HIS PARTNER OF MORE THAN THREE DECADES, THE FORMIDABLE MICHÈLE LAMY, HAVE BUILT THEIR BUSINESS OWENSCORP ON ONE OF THE INDUSTRY’S MOST DEFIANTLY UNCOMPROMISING AESTHETICS, A THRILLING COMBINATION OF ELDRITCH GLAMOUR AND BARBARIC FUTURISM. THEY’VE TAKEN IT TO THE BANK AND BACK TO THE TUNE OF CASH REGISTERS RINGING UP HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SALES OF CLOTHING, ACCESSORIES, AND THE LAMY-SUPERVISED COLLECTION OF BRUTALIST FURNITURE THAT EXTENDS THE OWENS ETHOS INTO THE WORLD OF INTERIORS. THE COUPLE HAVE LED A CHARMED LIFE, UNIQUELY BONDED IN THEIR CHALLENGE TO ORTHODOX THOUGHT AND DEED. BUT THERE ARE OTHER CHALLENGES GREATER BY FAR. TAKE THE PANDEMIC, FOR INSTANCE, AND THE WAY IT HAS UNHINGED SOCIAL STABILITY AND, TO A DEPRESSING DEGREE, SIMPLE HUMAN REASON. THEN THERE’S TIME, BRUTAL AND UNFORGIVING IN ITS PASSAGE. AS OWENS APPROACHED THE MILESTONE OF 60, HE FOUND A YOUNG MALE MUSE, WHOSE VIKING VISAGE WILL BE FAMILIAR TO ANYONE WHO SAW THE DESIGNER’S PRESENTATIONS DURING LOCKDOWN. IN HIS PERFECT PHYSICAL EMBODIMENT OF THE OWENS ETHOS, HE OPENED A PANDORA’S BOX FOR RICK OF WHAT ONCE WAS, WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, AND WHAT NOW SEEMED POSSIBLE ALL OVER AGAIN. A DEFIANT ANTIDOTE TO TEMPUS FUGIT, IN OTHER WORDS. EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHOSE SENSIBILITY COMFORTABLY EMBRACES ANTIQUITY AND THE FUTURE IN EQUAL DEGREE, THAT POSSIBILITY WAS STILL A PROFOUND SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM. IT HAS TAKEN A DIFFICULT WHILE, BUT OWENS INSISTS HE HAS MANAGED TO PROCESS THE INNER TURMOIL, BALANCE HIS EMOTIONAL ALLEGIANCES, MAYBE EVEN RECONCILE HIS PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE. IN MARCH, HE RETURNED TO LIVE SHOWS IN PARIS WITH WHAT WAS, QUITE POSSIBLY, THE SHOW OF HIS CAREER. OF COURSE, THAT’S A HARD CALL WITH A DESIGNER WHO HAS REGULARLY PROVOKED AND STUNNED OVER THE YEARS. FOR ALL THE STEP DANCERS, DEATH-METAL ACROBATS, PENISES IN FULL EFFECT, AND PYRES OF RAGING FLAME SO FLAGRANT IN THOSE PAST PRESENTATIONS, THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE POWERFUL ABOUT THE DISCREET GRACE OF OWENS’S MODELS PARADING THROUGH A VENETIAN-LIKE FOG IN THEIR GODDESS DRESSES TO THE STRAINS OF MAHLER’S FIFTH SYMPHONY IN THE SAME WEEK THAT TSAR VLADIMIR INVADED UKRAINE. THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY FELT LIKE AN ACT OF DEFIANCE IN THE FACE OF FASCIST UGLINESS. ULTIMATELY FUTILE, MAYBE, BUT BREATHTAKINGLY POIGNANT IN THE MOMENT. WHAT CRUCIBLE SHAPED SUCH VISIONS? I’LL NEVER STOP WONDERING, AND WE’LL NEVER NOT HAVE PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT. THE OWENS GEOGRAPHY ALONE: BIRTHED IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, TRANSMOGRIFIED ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, TRANSPLANTED TO PARIS, WORKING IN CONCORDIA SULLA SECCHIA IN THE EMILIA-ROMAGNA, LIVING ON THE LIDO IN VENICE… BUT LET’S START WITH THE TRULY WILD CARD. EGYPT! RICK OWENS: A WHILE AGO, PARIS AND ITALY WERE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME PERSONALLY. I FELT LIKE I WAS RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. BUT WHEN MICHÈLE AND I WENT TO EGYPT, THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT GOING SO FAR OUT OF MY PERSONAL ZONE THAT JUST PUT EVERYTHING BACK INTO PERSPECTIVE, AND I GOT ALL MY COMFORT BACK. I’VE BEEN TWICE IN THE LAST YEAR. IT IS JUST THE LEGEND OF IT I LOVE. I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF MY TEAM MEMBERS WHO WENT TO EGYPT LAST MONTH AND WAS SO DISTURBED BY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE-NOTS THAT HE DIDN’T ENJOY IT. MY PERSPECTIVE WAS THAT THERE IS DISCOMFORT ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND EGYPT TO ME IS MORE ABOUT PROPORTION AND SPACE. THERE IS SO MUCH. I GO TO THIS VERY OLD AND SHABBY HOTEL AND THERE IS THIS EMPTINESS. THE VALLEY OF THE GODS AND THESE MASSIVE MONUMENTS THAT ARE SOOOOOO ANCIENT, AND THEN DESERT AND SCRUBLAND, AND A POOL. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIMPLICITY OF ALL THAT WAS WORKING FOR ME. IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED RIGHT THEN. AND PROBABLY IT WAS ABOUT MORTALITY, TOO. I MEAN, THESE ARE MONUMENTS BUILT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD, AND THIS IS HOW THEY WANTED TO BE REMEMBERED. AND DECIDING TO BE REMEMBERED IS QUITE INTERESTING. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LEGACY A LOT, AND I GUESS THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING. I’M THINKING ABOUT WHAT IMPRESSION I WANT TO LEAVE. I TURNED 60 IN NOVEMBER. AND THERE IS NOTHING I LOVE MORE THAN READING BIOGRAPHIES OF WEIRD ECCENTRICS FROM THE PAST. MICHÈLE IS ALWAYS TELLING ME THAT I ONLY LOVE DEAD ARTISTS AND I’M LIKE, ‘YEAH, BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE HOW IT ALL WORKED OUT! I WANT TO SEE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE MOMENTUM AND MAINTAIN THEIR CONDITIONS TO THE VERY END.’ I DON’T WANT TO INVEST IN SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO CHANGE OR TURN INTO A DIFFERENT PERSON. DIDN’T YOU SAY ONCE THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS FUNDAMENTALLY WHO YOU ARE? THERE IS NO ESCAPE. RICK OWENS: YEAH, I MEAN THAT IS WHY I COMMIT TO THINGS. IT’S AS SIMPLE AS WHAT I WEAR. I HAVE A UNIFORM THAT I WEAR ALL THE TIME AND I HAVE DECIDED WHO I WANT TO BE. HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU THE VOGUE VIDEO WE DID. WE PAUSE TO WATCH RICK’S EDITION OF VOGUE’S ‘OBJECTS OF AFFECTION’, FOR WHICH HE TOOK VIEWERS ON A VIDEO TOUR OF HIS APARTMENT IN CONCORDIA SULLA SECCHIA, NEAR MODENA. IT’S A TWO-HOUR DRIVE SOUTH-WEST OF THE LIDO IN VENICE, WHERE HE HAS ANOTHER APARTMENT, THE LOCATION FOR HIS DIGITAL PRESENTATIONS DURING THE INDUSTRY’S COVID SHUTDOWN. IN CONCORDIA, HE LIVES ACROSS THE STREET FROM HIS FACTORY IN AN APARTMENT AS STARK AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. THE SPACE IS PARTIALLY CARPETED AND UPHOLSTERED WITH ARMY BLANKETS, AS ALL HIS APARTMENTS HAVE BEEN SINCE HE LIVED ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN THE 1980S. (‘INSPIRED BY JOSEPH BEUYS, WHO WAS MY FIRST ART HERO WHEN I WENT TO ART SCHOOL.’) AS HE SAYS IN THE VIDEO, HE IS NOT VERY ACQUISITIVE AND DOESN’T LIKE LIVING WITH A LOT OF THINGS. RICK IS PARTICULARLY PROUD, HOWEVER, OF HIS EGYPTIAN SARCOPHAGUS. HE WAITED FOR A LONG TIME FOR THE RIGHT ONE. HE CALLS HER LIZA, AFTER LIZA MINNELLI. RICK WOULD HAVE MADE A WONDERFUL RECLUSIVE ROCK STAR, À LA MICK JAGGER IN PERFORMANCE. YOU ARE VERY, VERY SERIOUS IN THAT VIDEO. I DON’T THINK OF YOU AS BEING SO SERIOUS. DO YOU THINK IT COMES ACROSS THAT WAY? RICK OWENS: IF YOU KNOW ME, THEN I GUESS IT IS A BIT DEADPAN. BUT ANYWAY, WHEN THEY SUGGESTED IT TO ME, THIS IS WHAT I’D WANTED TO GET, SOMETHING SEDATE AND CALM, NOT TOO POP AND TOO LIVELY, KIND OF A NON-FLASHY ALTERNATIVE DESIGNER KIND OF THING. AND IT CAME OUT GREAT. THOSE KIDS WHO FOLLOW YOU ON DISCORD ARE GOING TO GO CRAZY. THIS WILL BE LIKE MOSES COMING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN WITH THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. RICK OWENS: THERE IS A LOT THERE THAT’S RIPE FOR PARODY, LIKE WHEN I SAY I HAVE 20 PAIRS OF SHORTS. WHEN JONATHAN [WINGFIELD, SYSTEM’S EDITOR] AND I WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION AT THE BEGINNING, WE CAME UP WITH ‘A TALE OF THREE CITIES: HOLLYWOOD, PARIS AND VENICE’. BUT I’M MORE INCLINED TO TWO, HOLLYWOOD AND VENICE, BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT YOU MADE YOURSELF INTO IN HOLLYWOOD IS CONSUMMATED BY YOU LIVING IN THAT VISCONTI ENVIRONMENT IN VENICE. RICK OWENS: IT IS, IT IS. THE FULL ARC. WHAT DOES VENICE MEAN? IT DOES FEEL LIKE AN ARC COMPLETED. HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST SAW DEATH IN VENICE? RICK OWENS: I MUST HAVE BEEN IN MY 20S. I’M SURE IT WAS AT THE VISTA THEATRE, A BIG DECREPIT BARN OF A BUILDING, WITH EGYPTIAN GOLD MOTIFS. I WENT WITH MY ROOMMATE LINDA. WE WERE BOTH GOTHS LIVING IN A GOTH HOUSE. SHE WENT ON TO BE A NURSERY-SCHOOL TEACHER IN SEATTLE. SO WE GO WITH HER BAG FULL OF WINE AND GET SHIT-FACED DURING THE MOVIE, AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW DEATH IN VENICE. DOES THAT COME BACK TO YOU WHEN YOU’RE IN YOUR APARTMENT ON THE LIDO? LIVING RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE GRAND HÔTEL DES BAINS. RICK OWENS: THAT IS WHY I MOVED THERE. I NEVER READ THE BOOK, BUT MY FIRST ATTRACTION TO THE LIDO WAS THAT MOVIE, THAT ERA. THE EXOTICISM OF VENICE, HOW IT REALLY IS ONE OF THE MOST GLAMOROUS PLACES IN THE PARTICULAR WORLD THAT I’M INTERESTED IN. HOW RELEVANT DO YOU THINK GROWING UP IN PORTERVILLE IS TO THE FACT THAT YOU NOW LIVE IN VENICE? RICK OWENS: I WAS PROPELLED, WASN’T I? I MEAN, IF I HAD HAD A PERFECTLY WELL-ADJUSTED SEDATE CHILDHOOD, WHERE WOULD I BE NOW? YOU NEED SOMETHING TO PUSH YOU. WHERE WOULD YOU BE NOW? RICK OWENS: I’D BE SOMETHING MY DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED ME TO BE. HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOY IN THE WORLD? RICK OWENS: YES. IT IS IRRESISTIBLE TO COMPOSE SOMETHING WITH YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND THREAT AND DECLINE. IT’S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING STORIES. GLORIOUS BEAUTY, THREATENED. OF COURSE THERE IS SADNESS BECAUSE THERE IS DECLINE AT THE END. BUT THAT IS HOW THE WORLD WORKS; THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A SAD ENDING. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOY IN THE WORLD DOCUMENTS THE BLIGHTED LIFE OF BJÖRN ANDRÉSEN, SUBSEQUENT TO HIS APPEARANCE AS TADZIO, THE GOLDEN YOUTH IN VISCONTI’S DEATH IN VENICE. OWENS DROLLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FILM ADDS AN IRRESISTIBLY EMBLEMATIC EDGE TO HIS OWN MALE-MUSE SITUATION, BUT, AS HE SO ACCURATELY NOTES, THAT STORY IS HARDLY HIS STORY. AND, AFTER ALL, DOOM – MANIFESTED IN THE GORGEOUS DYING FALL OF TRANSIENT BEAUTY – HAS BEEN A REGULAR OWENS GO-TO OVER THE YEARS. AS THIS ISSUE OF SYSTEM APPEARS, HE IS PRESENTING HIS LATEST MEN’S COLLECTION, IN WHICH A BLAZING GLOBE REPRESENTING THE SUN IS RAISED HIGH BY A FORKLIFT, BEFORE CRASHING TO THE GROUND. IS THE COLLAPSING SUN YOUR COMMENT ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS? RICK OWENS: IT’S JUST DOOM, AND FRUSTRATION WITH WORLD ISSUES. THE SUN, GOODNESS OVER EVIL, CRASHING TO THE GROUND, DESTROYED… EVIL TRIUMPHS? RICK OWENS: WELL, THE REPETITION IMPLIES THAT IT DOESN’T TRIUMPH, IT’S JUST REPEATING. YOU SAY ‘DOOM’ WITH SUCH A DRY CHUCKLE, BUT I KNOW YOU MEAN IT. RICK OWENS: I CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE FACT THAT THE GOOD HAS SOMEHOW ALWAYS MANAGED TO TRIUMPH OVER EVIL. THAT IS ALWAYS MY MESSAGE. AM I GUILTY SOMETIMES OF ROMANTICISING GLOOM AND DOOM? MAYBE. BUT GLAMORISING IT IS ALSO A WAY OF PROCESSING IT BECAUSE IT’S SOMETHING THAT IS OMNIPRESENT. THERE WAS ANOTHER ARTICLE WHERE I HAD THIS SARCOPHAGUS AND THIS SKULL, AND THE WRITER WAS LIKE, ‘HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH THOSE VIBES?’, AND I AM LIKE, ‘HOW CAN YOU NOT LIVE WITH THOSE VIBES?’ LIFE IS ABOUT DEATH AND THREAT, AND CIVILISATIONS HAVE GOT ALL SORTS OF WAYS OF DEALING WITH IT. WHY ARE THERE ARE CROSSES ALL OVER EVERYONE’S HOUSES? IT’S TO REMIND US ALL THAT CHRIST SUFFERED MORE THAN ANYONE EVER WILL, AND IN TIMES OF STRESS AND PAIN, YOU ARE BEING REMINDED THAT SOMEONE SUFFERED LONGER OR MORE INTENSELY THAN YOU. SUFFERING IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO, AND THAT IS WHY THERE ARE ALL THOSE DEPICTIONS OF A DYING MAN ON A CROSS. I MEAN, BESIDES THE MORALITY AND THE SPIRITUALITY OF IT, IT SERVES A VERY PRACTICAL PURPOSE: TO GET US NOT TO BE AFRAID OF SUFFERING – OR AT LEAST NOT BE SURPRISED BY IT. WE TALK ABOUT RICK’S BACKGROUND. AN ONLY CHILD, HE WAS RAISED IN A STAUNCHLY CATHOLIC ENVIRONMENT. HIS FATHER, JOHN, DIED IN 2015; HIS MOTHER CONNIE, NOW 88, HAS HAD SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES. HE IS MOVING HER FROM PORTERVILLE TO CONCORDIA. I THINK THAT’S INCREDIBLY BRAVE ON EVERYONE’S PART. IF YOU’RE MOVING YOUR MOM TO CONCORDIA, YOU’RE PLANNING ON BEING THERE A LOT? RICK OWENS: AS SOON AS WE WERE ABLE TO TRAVEL AFTER COVID, I THOUGHT OF CONCORDIA AS THE BASIS OF ALL OUR SURVIVAL. WE ALL NEED CONCORDIA TO WORK FOR ALL OF US, SO I KIND OF HUNKERED DOWN THERE, BECAUSE THERE WAS A BIT OF RESTABILIZING TO DO. I ALWAYS SAID ITALY IS WHERE I GO TO CREATE AND PARIS IS WHERE I GO TO BE JUDGED. PARIS IS NOT THE MOST WELCOMING PLACE, BUT IN CONCORDIA I HAVE A WHOLE ARMY – MAYBE 200 PEOPLE – WORKING, SO IT ENDS UP BEING A COSIER PLACE. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE DEPENDING ON YOU, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE SHAMAN OF THE TRIBE? RICK OWENS: MORE LIKE THE VILLAGE IDIOT. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE ALL LUCKY, I’M BASICALLY THE GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGG, AND WE ALL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT. IT SEEMS REALLY GUTSY OF YOUR MOM TO MOVE. RICK OWENS: I HAVE A REALLY NICE HOUSE FOR HER NEAR THE FACTORY, WITH NICE HIGH CEILINGS AND A HUGE GARDEN. MOM IS SCARED OF LEAVING THE HOUSE SHE IS SO ATTACHED TO IN PORTERVILLE. IT WAS HER SANCTUARY, THE HOUSE I BUILT FOR HER ACROSS TOWN SO SHE COULD ESCAPE FROM DAD AT A POINT WHEN HE WAS GETTING VERY DARK AS HE GOT OLDER. HE WAS BITTER AND ANGRY, AND HE WASN’T SPEAKING TO ME FOR YEARS BEFORE HE DIED. SHE HAD THAT HOUSE FOR THREE YEARS, AND EVERY DAY SHE WOULD GO FURNITURE SHOPPING AND BUY STUFF FOR IT. HE THOUGHT SHE WAS OUT WITH FRIENDS, SO HE NEVER KNEW. SHE COULD DECORATE IT HOW SHE WANTED IT WITHOUT HIM LEAVING ALL HIS STUFF ALL OVER THE PLACE. HE WOULD OIL AND POLISH ALL HIS GUNS AND THEN LEAVE THEM OUT ON THE DINING-ROOM TABLE, WITH ALL THE OILY MESS EVERYWHERE. LIKE A GUTTED ANIMAL. IT WAS A SORT OF DISPLAY IN A WAY, LIKE A PUZZLE FOR HIM, AND A SYMBOL OF MANHOOD AND OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. DID HE USE THEM? RICK OWENS: WE WOULD GO OUT TARGET PRACTISING. RECENTLY I’VE BEEN TO THE TARGET-PRACTICE PLACE IN VENICE; IT’S LIKE A CONCRETE BUNKER AND IT’S WHERE THEY TRAIN THE POLICE FORCE, AND THESE GUYS WERE LIKE, ‘YOU SHOULD JOIN THE POLICE FORCE; YOU ARE GOOD’. APPARENTLY I AM GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE LIDO POLICE FORCE. SO ANYWAY, I UNDERSTAND MOM’S CONNECTION WITH THAT HOUSE. SHE IS AFRAID, SHE IS LIKE, ‘YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PUT ME INTO A HOSPITAL ARE YOU?’ I’M LIKE, ‘I SWEAR I WILL NEVER DO THAT.’ BUT ALL HER FRIENDS ARE DYING, AND I HAVE TO PULL HER OUT OF THERE. I TOLD HER THIS ISN’T A DEFINITIVE PLAN: ‘YOU HAVE YOUR HOUSE THERE, YOU HAVE YOUR HOUSE IN CONCORDIA, YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY IN MEXICO, YOU CAN CIRCULATE. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, AND YOU KNOW I AM GETTING YOU A TICKET WITH A RETURN FLIGHT, SO YOU DON’T FEEL TRAPPED IN ITALY.’ BUT IT IS TIME TO COME AND SEE HOW IT FEELS. SHE HAS NO CHOICE. IS IT LITERALLY THAT BAD IN PORTERVILLE? RICK OWENS: ALL HER FRIENDS ARE DYING. SHE WAS A TEACHER’S AIDE FOR MIGRANT FARM WORKERS. SHE WOULD INTERPRET FOR THEM, SO SHE HAS A FOLLOWING OF ALL THESE KIDS WHO GREW UP WITH HER AS THEIR MATERNAL FIGURE. THEY VISIT WITH THEIR GRANDKIDS AND THEY ARE VERY ATTENTIVE, BUT THEY’RE NOT HER FAMILY. I’M THE ONLY ONE, AND I CAN’T BE OVER THERE THAT MUCH. WERE YOU GOING MORE OFTEN? RICK OWENS: I WENT FOR THE FIRST TIME RECENTLY IN LIKE 20 YEARS, WHEN SHE STARTED STRUGGLING. I HAVE ALWAYS RESISTED BECAUSE I THOUGHT I DIDN’T WANT TO RETURN TO A PLACE WHERE I HAD BEEN WEAK OR STRUGGLING OR FRUSTRATED. I MEAN, WHY WOULD I WANT TO REMEMBER THAT? BUT IT WAS GREAT. I TOTALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW GREAT IT FEELS TO GO BACK AT FULL POWER. IT FELT VERY REASSURING AND COMFORTING, AND VERY FAMILIAR. I WAS LIKE, WHY AM I IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD HERE? I WAS NEVER HAPPY HERE; THIS WAS WHERE I WAS FRUSTRATED AND THREATENED. WHY AM I HAPPY HERE NOW? I AM STILL NOT SURE. SO IT WASN’T LIKE INGRID BERGMAN AND THE VISIT? YOU REMEMBER THAT FILM? SHE RETURNED TO THE TOWN WHERE SHE WAS RAISED, WHERE ANTHONY QUINN’S CHARACTER HAD RAPED HER WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG. SHE HAD LEFT TOWN UNDER A CLOUD, GONE OFF AND MARRIED THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD. SHE INHERITS HIS WEALTH, AND THEN COMES BACK TO TOWN, WHERE QUINN IS NOW THE MAYOR, AND SETS ABOUT DESTROYING HIM BY SLOWLY CORRUPTING THE WHOLE PLACE AND TURNING EVERYONE AGAINST HIM. RICK OWENS: WHY DIDN’T I DO THAT? I THOUGHT THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY. RICK OWENS: I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE! SO YOU WENT BACK AND FELT COMFORTABLE THERE? RICK OWENS: I FELT GREAT COMFORT AND SERENITY THERE, HANGING OUT WITH MOM IN HER GARDEN. YEAH, IT WAS LOVELY. DID YOU EVER RESOLVE THINGS WITH YOUR DAD? RICK OWENS: THERE WAS NOTHING TO RESOLVE REALLY. IT WAS A WAR THAT WE HAD TOGETHER. MY DAD WAS SUCH A BIG LESSON BECAUSE WE HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FRANK ABOUT EVERYTHING, LIKE HARD-ASS BLUNT. SO I DIDN’T THINK ANYTHING WAS OFF THE TABLE WITH HIM. I HAD DESCRIBED OUR RELATIONSHIP AS TENSE BECAUSE HE WAS VERY RIGHT-WING. IN ONE ARTICLE I DESCRIBED HIM AS AN ADORABLE NAZI, AND HE WAS FINE WITH THAT; HE DID HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR. HE THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNY. BUT THEN IN ANOTHER ARTICLE, I SAID I HAD A HARD TIME WITH WHAT I PERCEIVED AS HIS BIGOTRY, AND THAT HE COULDN’T FORGIVE. BECAUSE I WOULD NOT DEBATE WITH HIM, AND HE WANTED TO HAVE A DEBATE TO PROVE EMPIRICALLY THAT HE WAS NOT BIGOTED. I WAS, LIKE, THIS IS JUST MY INTERPRETATION. I MEAN, WHO AM I? BUT I HAD A LOUDER MEGAPHONE THAN HE DID; I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAY THAT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, AND HE COULDN’T RETALIATE WITH A BIGGER MICROPHONE. THAT WAS WHAT BROKE US. IT WASN’T THE FACT WE DISAGREED; IT WAS THE FACT THAT I WAS LOUDER. SURELY EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU – THE WAY YOU WERE LIVING, THE WAY YOU TRANSFORMED YOURSELF – HE WOULD HAVE SEEN AS A TOTAL REJECTION OF WHAT HE WAS. RICK OWENS: IT WAS, AND I HAVE TO HAND IT TO HIM, HE WAS A GOOD SPORT. HE SHOWED UP TO THE SHOWS AND HE SAT NEXT TO THE DRAG QUEENS, AND HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THE HOMOSEXUALS, WHICH WAS AMAZING. I MEAN, HE BIT HIS LIP, BUT HE SHOWED UP. SO THAT IS IMPRESSIVE. AND HE WAS PROUD? RICK OWENS: YEAH, HE WASN’T GUSHY, BUT HE DEFINITELY SAID, ‘IT IS AMAZING WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.’ I MEAN, HE HATED IT, BUT HE WAS DEFINITELY IMPRESSED. BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS THE LAST THING WHERE MY VOICE WAS LOUDER. THAT WAS A LESSON BECAUSE – AND THIS HAS HAPPENED WITH MICHÈLE, TOO – SOMETIMES I’VE SAID SOMETHING THAT, OUT OF CONTEXT, DIDN’T SOUND COMFORTABLE TO HER, AND WHILE IT NEVER BECAME A HUGE PROBLEM, I’VE LEARNED THAT ANYTHING I SAY IN THIS CONTEXT IS GOING TO CHANGE AND BE AMPLIFIED ONCE IT IS PRINTED – AND I CAN’T DO THAT TO PEOPLE I LOVE ANY MORE, EVEN THOUGH I AM DYING TO TALK ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME. I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT IT IS JUST LIKE A POWER THAT IS TOO UNWIELDLY IN A WAY. AFTER A CONVERSATION RICK AND I HAD IN MARCH, I WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THAT AMPLIFICATION. HE WAS TRYING TO CLARIFY HIS FEELINGS ABOUT THE PRESENCE IN HIS LIFE OF SOMEONE WHO WAS MUCH YOUNGER, CAREFREE, VIBRANT. IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH HE WAS THINKING ALOUD, THINKING THROUGH A DIFFICULT SITUATION. I WAS ALSO GETTING SO VULNERABLE. I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF IT NOW. WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU THEN, THERE WAS A LOT OF DESPERATION, BUT I HAVE FOUND MYSELF AGAIN AND FOUND MY SPECIALNESS AND MY POWERS. THANK GOD FOR THAT. YOU WERE DOUBTING YOURSELF AND I WAS LIKE, PLEASE, NO! RICK OWENS: I NEVER DOUBTED WHAT I DO; I WAS JUST DESTABILISED. THERE IS LIKE THIS REGRET WHEN YOU SEE THIS SHINING EXAMPLE OF VITALITY AND YOU SEE YOUR REFLECTION IN THAT. IT’S KIND OF, WOW, I DON’T THINK I EVER WAS THAT. THERE IS NO WAY I AM EVER GOING TO BE THAT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE – AND THAT IS A KIND OF DEATH. THERE IS A MOURNING AND A SHOCK. YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY DRAMA, THIS DOESN’T HAPPEN TO EVERY SINGLE 60-YEAR-OLD MAN. IT WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL I THINK. IT’S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO EVEN CONCEPTUALISE WHAT SORT OF VITALITY YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD HAVE NEVER HAD. THAT’S WHY I’M FASCINATED BY YOUR EARLY LIFE IN LA. WE’VE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT. I REMEMBER TELLING YOU HOW MUCH I LOVED THE SCREAMERS, AND YOU MADE A THROWAWAY COMMENT ABOUT [THE BAND’S CO-FOUNDER] TOMMY GEAR AND I DIDN’T KNOW IF THAT WAS FOR REAL OR NOT. RICK OWENS: THAT I FCKED TOMMY GEAR? WELL, THAT YOU WERE WITH HIM [PAUSE FOR TB’S ATTACK OF THE VAPOURS]. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SCREAMERS IN 1978 AND THAT SEEMS A LITTLE… EARLY FOR THIS STORY. RICK OWENS: I GRADUATED IN 1979 AND MY WILD YEARS IN LA WERE THROUGH TO 1985 AND THEN I WAS WITH MICHÈLE. SO TELL ME ABOUT THOSE WILD YEARS. RICK OWENS: I GRADUATED IN 1979 FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN PORTERVILLE, THEN I WORKED AS A PHARMACY DELIVERY BOY FOR A WHILE. THEY HAD A TRUCK, AND I WOULD DELIVER PILLS UNTIL… THEY HAD A PRESCRIPTION FOR DIET PILLS THAT NOBODY PICKED UP FOR A LONG TIME AND I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY A TRAP FOR DELIVERY BOYS. SO I TOOK THEM AND THEN I GOT FIRED, BUT THEY NEVER SAID THAT WAS WHY. SO I AM NEVER REALLY SURE IF THAT WAS IT. WERE THOSE THE QUAALUDE YEARS? RICK OWENS: NO, IT WAS ALWAYS SPEED. WE NEVER HAD GOOD QUAALUDES IN PORTERVILLE. I WAS MAINLY DRINKING, AND I THINK MOM COULD SEE THAT I WAS JUST GOING DOWN THE DRAIN. I THINK MY SCHOOL COUNSELLOR SUGGESTED OTIS [COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN], SO MOM ORGANISED A TRIP TO GO SEE IT WITH ME. SHE HELPED ME GET AN APARTMENT AND SHE KIND OF SET ME UP THERE. I THINK HER FRIEND HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS LIVING IN LOS ANGELES. WHAT DID YOU LOOK LIKE AT THAT POINT? RICK OWENS: I ALWAYS THOUGHT I LOOKED REALLY SOFT AND VULNERABLE. I WAS ALWAYS A BIT EMBARRASSED. I LOOKED A LITTLE LIZA MINNELLI-ISH… BIG, OPEN COW-LIKE EYES, INNOCENT. LIKE AN INNOCENT GERBIL IN THE BIG CITY, TRYING TO LOOK TOUGH. AND YOUR HAIR? RICK OWENS: THERE WERE SO MANY VARIATIONS. I MEAN, AFTER I MET [EXTREME PERFORMANCE ARTIST] RON ATHEY, I STARTED DOING THE SPIKES LIKE RON. I HAD SPIKES IN THE FRONT AND AT THE BACK. AS AN INNOCENT GERBIL IN THE BIG CITY, HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MEET RON ATHEY? RICK OWENS: I GOT A JOB AS AN EXTRAS SCOUT, SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO OUT AND PUT TOGETHER A PUNK CLUB SCENE. I SAW RON ATHEY ON THE STREET AND I GOT HIS NUMBER AND ASKED IF HE WANTED A JOB. HE NEEDED A RIDE, SO I ENDED UP DRIVING HIM TO THE SET. HE DIDN’T HAVE ALL THE TATTOOS YET. HE HAD A VERY SOFT FACE, TOO, BUT HE HAD THESE EYES THAT WERE REALLY EVIL AND THEN A TEARDROP HERE [RICK INDICATES THE CORNER OF HIS EYE], AND THESE HAIR SPIKES. HE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I HAD EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. ANYWAY, I TOTALLY PURSUED HIM, THOUGH HE NEVER REALLY RESPONDED. I WAS GOING OUT WITH MICHAEL, THIS GUY FROM A BAND – I FORGET ITS NAME – AND HE LIVED WITH HIS LOVER, SPIDER, WHO WORKED AT BASIC PLUMBING, A SEX CLUB ON LA BREA AVENUE. THEY HAD BEEN TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME, SO IT WAS FINE FOR ME TO BE MICHAEL’S BOYFRIEND, AND WE ALL WENT TO A PARTY IN DOWNTOWN LA ON THE TRACKS. RON ATHEY WAS THERE, AND I SNUCK OFF WITH RON AND WE HAD SEX ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS. I ACTUALLY ALREADY TOLD THIS STORY TO THIS CUTE LITTLE PUNK ROCK MAGAZINE CALLED INSURRECTION. I THINK THE SCREAMERS WERE IN A PUNK MOVIE. POPULATION: 1. WAS IT THAT? RICK OWENS: IT WASN’T EVEN A PUNK MOVIE; IT WAS A JOHN CANDY MOVIE THAT NEVER EVEN CAME OUT. IT WAS A COMEDY, AND HE BLUNDERS INTO A PUNK CLUB AT ONE POINT. IT WAS REALLY STUPID. SO ANYWAY, I’VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH RON OVER THE YEARS. MICHÈLE AND I WOULD GO TO HIS PERFORMANCES YEARS AFTER I MET HIM. HE WAS MY AGE, SO WE WOULD HAVE BEEN 30 BY THEN, AND HE HAD BECOME THE PERFORMANCE ARTIST, AND WE WOULD GO SEE HIM AT CLUB FCK! IN SILVERLAKE, THE THING WHERE HE WOULD CUT HIMSELF, THEN PUT THE PAPER TOWELS ACROSS HIS BACK AND STRING THEM ACROSS THE AUDIENCE. HE WAS SPECTACULAR. I’M GRASPING AT CHRONOLOGY HERE. YOU MOVED TO LA IN 1980? RICK OWENS: IT WAS A YEAR AFTER I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS STILL DRINKING IN PORTERVILLE AND MY MOM PUSHED ME TO LA. AND I WENT TO OTIS, THE ART SCHOOL. FOR THE TWO YEARS I WAS THERE, I DIDN’T REALLY EXPLORE THAT MUCH. I WAS VERY DEVOTED TO ART SCHOOL AND THAT AREA, DOWNTOWN LA. I DIDN’T EVEN GO TO THAT MANY PUNK CLUBS. DID YOU GO TO THE VEIL? RICK OWENS: I MIGHT HAVE. SOMEONE SAID THEY SAW ME ONCE, BUT I DON’T THINK SO. I WENT TO POWER TOOLS. IT WAS KIND OF AFTER GOTH. THERE WAS PLASTIC PASSION. THERE WAS THE BITTER END. PAUL FORTUNE HAD SOMETHING…WAIT, HE WAS THE ONE RUNNING THE VEIL. AND IN HIS BOOK HE SAID HE REMEMBERS A YOUNG RICK OWENS HANGING OUT BY THE BACK DOOR OR SOMETHING. I DON’T THINK I WAS THERE. [LAUGHS] FOR THE TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE WHERE I DIDN’T REALLY CIRCULATE THAT MUCH, I HAD A VERY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. I WAS KIND OF QUIET, DOING ART-SCHOOL STUFF, VERY MUCH IN THAT AREA, DOWNTOWN LA, BUT NOT THE DOWNTOWN THAT IS FABULOUS, JUST ART-STUDENT-POOR-PEOPLE DOWNTOWN. I MEAN, I MUST HAVE HAD DRIVE AND AMBITION, BUT I THINK THE LAZY SIDE OF ME WAS DRINKING TOO MUCH OUT OF FRUSTRATION AND BITTERNESS. MY DRINKING WAS ALWAYS VERY DARK. WHAT WOULD YOU DRINK? RICK OWENS: VODKA. GET ME THERE FAST; I DIDN’T HAVE TIME FOR BEER. EVEN AT OTIS, YOU WERE PLAGUED BY BITTER DRINKING? RICK OWENS: NO, EVERYTHING THERE WAS NEW; THERE WAS PROBABLY POTENTIAL BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL. I WAS CREATING STUFF; I WAS GOING SOMEWHERE; I WAS MOVING FORWARD. SO I WASN’T AS SELF-LOATHING OR FRUSTRATED THAT I COULDN’T BREAK THROUGH. THEN I STOPPED GOING, BECAUSE I JUST COULDN’T AFFORD IT ANY MORE. I TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANS AND THEN I GOT SCARED OF TAKING OUT MORE, SO FINANCIALLY IT WASN’T WORKING. THEN I WENT TO TRADE SCHOOL, AND THERE WAS JUST NOTHING FOR A WHILE. WERE YOU OUT AT THIS POINT? RICK OWENS: OH, YEAH. WERE YOU EVER SCARED FOR YOURSELF? RICK OWENS: OH, YEAH, THAT IS WHY I STOPPED DRINKING BECAUSE MY ALCOHOLISM WAS SO BAD. THEY HAD TO GIVE ME DOWNERS SO THAT I WOULDN’T HYPERVENTILATE BECAUSE I HAD THE SHAKES SO BAD. THAT WAS WHAT SCARED ME THE MOST. DID MICHÈLE TRY AND STOP YOU? RICK OWENS: SHE WOULD CALL THE DOCTORS. WE WERE LIVING ABOVE SWINGERS, THIS COFFEE SHOP THAT SEAN MACPHERSON WAS RUNNING. HE HAD THE BAR MARMONT, AND ALL THE COOL RESTAURANTS IN LOS ANGELES. IT WAS A COFFEE SHOP THAT WAS ALSO A REALLY FUNNY MOTEL. I HAD MY STUDIO, AND MICHÈLE WAS BUILDING HER RESTAURANT, CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, ACROSS THE STREET ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. WE WERE REALLY BROKE, AND THAT WAS WHEN MY ALCOHOLISM REACHED A PEAK. I THINK MICHÈLE AND I GOT TOGETHER WHEN I WAS 27, SO I WAS DRINKING FROM 25 TO 35. IT DIDN’T ALL CHANGE WHEN YOU CONNECTED WITH HER? RICK OWENS: IT WASN’T A HUGE LIFE CHANGE, BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY AN ALLIANCE. IT WAS VERY MUCH A SOULFUL CONNECTION, LIKE THIS IS MY OTHER HALF. OR LIKE, THAT WE BELONGED TOGETHER. THAT WHOLE THING ABOUT YOUR DRINKING BLOWS OUT OF THE WATER MY NOTION ABOUT YOU BEING ALWAYS IN CONTROL. RICK OWENS: WHEN I WASN’T DRINKING, I WAS ALWAYS VERY DRIVEN AND VERY ORGANISED, AND I GOT A LOT OF STUFF DONE. BUT THEN I WOULD HAVE THESE THREE-DAY BINGES WHERE I WOULD JUST PASS OUT, WAKE UP AND THEN JUST PASS OUT AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS I COULD TO SORT OF ESCAPE. IT WAS VERY SELF-DESTRUCTIVE. RIVEN WITH SELF-LOATHING? RICK OWENS: I DON’T THINK I HATED MYSELF, I THINK THERE WAS A SORT OF GAY SHAME SOMEWHERE FROM MY DAD, MY FAMILY AND PORTERVILLE. ALSO ALL THAT ENERGY AND AMBITION THAT WAS NOT COMING TO FRUITION… I THINK THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS. I WAS SHY, SO I NEEDED COURAGE TO DEMAND THE ATTENTION OR THE VALIDATION THAT I CRAVED. AND YOU THOUGHT THAT DRINKING BROUGHT OUT THE ATTENTION? RICK OWENS: NO, NO, IT GAVE ME THE COURAGE TO GO OUT AND BE SOMEBODY. THEN WHEN THAT WASN’T FULFILLING, IT JUST COMFORTED ME. THE OTHER THING I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE EXPRESSING YOURSELF CREATIVELY, THE PEOPLE WHO DO SO SUCCESSFULLY ARE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGHER SENSITIVITY. IN THE WORST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT CAN TRANSLATE INTO BEING A DRAMA QUEEN. I GET TO BE POETIC, THAT IS MY JOB, TO TRY AND CREATE POETRY AND TO TRY AND MAKE COMPOSITIONS OF THINGS THAT FEEL EMOTIONALLY COMPELLING. THE BAD SIDE TO THAT, THOUGH, IS THAT IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE, YOU CAN BE OVERLY ROMANTIC AND OVER-IDEALISTIC, OVERLY EMOTIONAL OR SENSITIVE. SO THERE IS A DRAMA-QUEEN SIDE TO IT. AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I WASN’T DRINKING FOR ATTENTION BUT TRYING TO GET ATTENTION FOR THE WORK I WAS DOING. THE DRINKING WAS TO GIVE ME THE COURAGE TO GO OUT AND PURSUE IT, THAT WAS THE ATTENTION I WANTED. I WANTED TO BE VALIDATED. I DIDN’T PERFORM; I WASN’T A PERFORMER. I STOPPED BECAUSE I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE. SO IT WAS FEAR. IT WASN’T ANYTHING NOBLE, JUST DUMB FEAR. WHEN YOU STOPPED, COULD YOU LOOK AT WHERE YOU HAD BEEN AND UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAD BEEN THERE? RICK OWENS: YEAH, I WAS FRUSTRATED. I THOUGHT I WAS A FAILURE. AND WHEN DID YOU STOP? RICK OWENS: I DID MY FIRST RUNWAY SHOW IN 1994; I STOPPED DRINKING MAYBE A YEAR BEFORE. BUT I WAS DOING CLOTHES FOR MAYBE FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE SHOW. I SOLD TO CHARLES GALLAY, BENDEL’S, JOYCE, CHARIVARI… SO YOU WERE DOING ALL THAT WHILE YOU WERE DRINKING YOURSELF TO DEATH. RICK OWENS: YEAH, I WAS GETTING A LOT DONE. THAT WAS WHO I WAS. I WAS A BIG DRINKER; MICHÈLE WAS, TOO. WE DRANK A LOT TOGETHER, SO IT MADE SENSE. WE WERE A PERFECT MATCH. WHEN DID YOUR PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION BEGIN? RICK OWENS: VERY SOON AFTER WE GOT TOGETHER. I WAS AN OFFICE BOY AT THIS ARCHITECTURAL ADMINISTRATION FIRM. THEY WERE VERY CHARMING, VERY BOHEMIAN, VERY SOPHISTICATED. THEY WOULD DO THESE HAND-DRAWN ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSTRATIONS FOR POTENTIAL BUILDINGS, LIKE HANDMADE RENDERINGS. THE OWNER WAS THE MAIN ILLUSTRATOR, AND WE WERE IN THIS REALLY CHARMING SORT OF SPANISH BUILDING DOWNTOWN. IT WAS VERY WORLD OF INTERIORS. THESE PEOPLE HAD A VERY CLEAR LINE ABOUT WHAT WAS OSTENTATIOUS OR TACKY. THEY WOULD HAVE OFFICE PARTIES AND INVITE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT SLIDES OF THEIR LATEST ITALIAN TOUR. IT WAS A GREAT ENVIRONMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, I STARTED GOING TO FASHION SCHOOL TO BE A PATTERN-MAKER. ART WAS TOO HARD. I DIDN’T UNDERSTAND IT ENOUGH; IT WAS TOO CEREBRAL FOR ME. THERE WERE THESE ART-THEORY CLASSES THAT WERE SO ABSTRACT AND INTIMIDATING AND I JUST THOUGHT I CAN’T BE AN ARTIST, I DON’T GET ALL THAT. THEY SCARED ME OUT OF PURSUING BEING AN ARTIST, SO I THOUGHT: ‘WELL, I AM SMART ENOUGH TO BE A DESIGNER, SO I’LL DO THAT.’ SO I WENT TO DESIGN SCHOOL AND THEN I GOT A JOB AS A PATTERN MAKER IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY DOWNTOWN. I WAS DOING PATTERNS AND KIND OF FAST-FASHION PATTERNS AND THEN SOMEBODY TOLD ME THERE WAS A JOB AT MICHÈLE’S LABEL. I WENT THERE AND THE REST IS HISTORY. DID SHE INTERVIEW YOU FOR THE JOB? RICK OWENS: SHE DID. I HAD A NOSE RING, AND I WORE A LONG DURAG IN THIS VERY BEAUTIFUL BROWN SILK JERSEY THAT I FOUND IN A HAT-TRIM PLACE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. I MUST HAVE WORN MAKE-UP. I DON’T KNOW WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO. AND YOUR HAIR? RICK OWENS: IT WAS ALWAYS BLACK, AND VERY WAVY. SO YOU MUST HAVE LOOKED KIND OF CHOLO, VERY MASCULINE. RICK OWENS: I THINK I DID, BUT I WAS SUPER, SUPER WHITE. FOR SOME REASON, I HAD VERY PALE SKIN. MICHÈLE HAD ALL THE JEWELLERY AND THE BRACELETS. SHE WAS MORE KITTENISH THEN, VERY LANGUOROUS. WE DIDN’T HOOK UP FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE WE DIDN’T DO THAT MUCH IN THE FACTORY RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. SHE JUST PASSED BY. SHE WOULD SOMETIMES HAVE A PARTY AT HER HOUSE AND I WOULD GO, OR WE WOULD RUN INTO EACH OTHER AT CLUBS. STUFF LIKE THAT FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE I DIDN’T REALLY KNOW HER. AND WHAT WAS THE TRIGGER TO CONNECT? RICK OWENS: I MEAN, SHE WAS SO ADORABLE AND CUTE, AND HAD SUCH GREAT BODY LANGUAGE AND STYLE. WE WERE JUST DRUNK ONE NIGHT, AND I MADE A MOVE. AND YOU HAD BEEN GAY UP UNTIL THEN? RICK OWENS: YEAH, I MEAN I HAD A GIRLFRIEND WAY BEFORE, SO I WASN’T COMPLETELY INNOCENT, BUT SHE WAS JUST SO CUTE. SHE WAS MARRIED, BUT IT WAS ALL VERY CASUAL AND BOHEMIAN. I DON’T REMEMBER ANY CONFRONTATIONS. I JUST REMEMBER ONE NIGHT AT THE CLUB, MICHÈLE AND I WERE THERE, AND I HAD MY ARM AROUND HER AND THEN RICHARD [NEWTON, LAMY’S FIRST HUSBAND] SHOWED UP, AND HE HAD A DRINK WITH US, BUT IT WAS LIKE NOTHING. LIKE WE KNEW IT WAS A MOMENT WHERE DECISIONS COULD BE MADE AND THINGS WERE BEING REVEALED AND AN UNDERSTANDING WAS BEING MET, BUT NO ONE REALLY SAID ANYTHING. ONE THING I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT IN LA WAS THE WAY THAT AIDS DECIMATED THINGS. RICK OWENS: I WAS GOING TO BRING THAT UP. DEATH WAS EVERYWHERE. FRIENDS OF MINE WERE ALWAYS GOING TO FUNERALS. I WASN’T THOUGH; I WENT TO, LIKE, TWO. THAT PERIOD WAS MY SEX PERIOD, BUT I LOVED THE SEX CLUBS, THAT WAS WHERE WE WOULD GO EVERY NIGHT. THAT WAS MY CLUBHOUSE. AND IT WAS JUST BEING IN AN EXTREME, EXOTIC ENVIRONMENT, WHERE EVERYBODY WAS GOING AS FAR AS THEY COULD GO. AND YOU WERE A VOYEUR? RICK OWENS: NO, I PARTICIPATED, VERY GLEEFULLY. THAT SOUNDED A BIT BOYISH. I ONCE WALKED PAST [LEGENDARY NEW YORK CLUB] MINESHAFT AND I WAS KIND OF SORRY I NEVER WENT IN, BUT IT JUST SMELLED SO BAD. RICK OWENS: YES, BUT THAT WAS PART OF IT. YOU SEE, I’M A PIG, YOU’RE NOT. I HAD KIND OF A PRISSY CHILDHOOD; MY FAMILY WAS A LITTLE PURITANICAL BUT ALSO VERY PRISSY ABOUT HYGIENE, SO THOSE WERE FORBIDDEN FRUITS, TO BE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. BY THE WAY, WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL, I WAS TERRIFIED ABOUT HAVING TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL AND BE NAKED IN THE SHOWERS WITH OTHER BOYS. THAT MADE ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE. THEN WHEN IT FINALLY HAPPENED, OBVIOUSLY I WAS SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE AND REALLY, WELL IT WAS JUST TERRIBLE… I MEAN, IT’S NOT LIKE ANYONE DID ANYTHING TO ME, BUT MY SEXUAL TENSION AND THAT ENVIRONMENT WITH ALL OF THESE GUYS, ALL THAT MASCULINITY. LIKE THE GAMES WHEN YOU HAD TO PICK THE TEAMS? FINALLY IN THE END, THEY WOULD JUST LET ME SIT DOWN AND READ. THAT MASCULINITY WAS SO THREATENING TO ME. ALL THAT NUDITY AND SEXUAL TENSION WAS A NIGHTMARE TO ME. SO WHEN I CAME INTO MY POWER, I TOOK OVER THAT SPACE. I HAD POWER SUDDENLY. I COULD RECREATE THAT SITUATION WITH ME WINNING. THAT’S WHY I MENTIONED INGRID BERGMAN GOING BACK TO THAT TOWN. YOU RESTRUCTURED. RICK OWENS: WELL, A LOT OF WHAT I PUT ON THE RUNWAY IS VENGEFUL. SHOWING EXPOSED DICKS ON THE RUNWAY, SHOWING DICKS INDIFFERENTLY… IT WAS AFTER DAD PASSED, BUT HAVING A PURITANICAL FATHER WHOSE MACHISMO WAS SO SACRED, FOR ME TO DO THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM. DO YOU THINK IT’S THAT FUNDAMENTAL? THAT THERE’S THIS KIND OF OEDIPAL CHALLENGE THROUGH YOUR CAREER, THAT YOU’RE CREATING WITH YOUR FATHER ON YOUR MIND A LOT OF THE TIME? RICK OWENS: YOUR FATHER IS YOUR GOD WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG, SO EVERYTHING YOU DO IS BASED AROUND SEEKING APPROVAL FROM THAT GOD OR DEALING WITH THE REJECTION. ALSO, BECAUSE WE WERE IN A SMALL TOWN WITH NO RELATIVES OR NO COUSINS, I DIDN’T HAVE A LOT OF OTHER KIDS AROUND. I WAS KIND OF A LONELY CHILD. OUR LITTLE CATHOLIC FAMILY WAS VERY INSULATED. HE ALSO DENIED YOU ACCESS TO ALL THE THINGS YOUR PEERS HAD, LIKE TELEVISION. RICK OWENS: NOW, LOOKING BACK ON IT, THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA AND WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL. LISTENING TO WAGNER DIDN’T COMPENSATE FOR MISSING THE MUNSTERS THOUGH. RICK OWENS: I HATED IT! I HATED HAVING TO SIT THROUGH ALL THAT MUSIC. AS AN ONLY CHILD WHO WAS CLOSE TO HIS MOM, DID YOU GANG UP ON YOUR DAD? RICK OWENS: WE WERE BOTH AFRAID OF HIM, NOT IN AN ABUSIVE WAY, BUT HE WAS VERY DOMINATING. AND MOM HAD GROWN UP IN A MEXICAN CATHOLIC FAMILY AND WAS VERY CONSCIOUS OF HER POSITION AS A WIFE AND MOTHER, AND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HER. I GUESS WE DID PROTEST TOGETHER A BIT, YEAH. I DID MENTION SEX CLUBS TO HIM AS A PROVOCATION. I NEVER REALLY CONSIDERED IT, BUT I THINK THE REVENGE I LOOKED FOR WAS OVER THE PAST. HERE WAS A GUY WHO GREW UP IN A CERTAIN TIME IN A CERTAIN WAY. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MOM AND I FELT REALLY BAD FOR HIM; WE FELT THAT HE HAD PROBLEMS, LIKE HE WAS EMOTIONALLY STUNTED, SO WE PROTECTED HIM. WE KNEW THAT ALL OF THIS CAME FROM FEAR AND SELF-DOUBT AND INSECURITY AND VULNERABILITY. WE BOTH FELT PROTECTIVE TOWARDS HIM. WHAT DO YOU SEE OF HIM IN YOU? RICK OWENS: BIGOTRY, AND I SEE ‘JUDGINESS’. I ALSO SEE THAT I HAVE A SET OF RULES THAT I THINK SHOULD APPLY TO EVERYBODY; I CATCH MYSELF BEING NARROW SOMETIMES AND IT IS ALMOST LIKE A GENETIC DISEASE THAT I AM REALLY AWARE OF. I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DISAPPROVE. I CAN ALSO GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION, AND NOT MAKE UP MY MIND, AND ALWAYS PLAY DEVIL’S ADVOCATE. I HAVE THIS MORAL SUPERIORITY AND THEN I FEEL THAT I OVERCOMPENSATE TO MAKE UP FOR IT. DOES THAT SORT ITSELF OUT WITH TIME? DO YOU FEEL YOU ARE MELLOWING? RICK OWENS: I FEEL VERY MELLOW IN RELATIONSHIPS. I FEEL YOU NEED TO LET A PERSON BE WHO THEY WANT TO BE; YOU NEED TO BE HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY CAN GIVE YOU AND NOT EXPECT MORE. YOU CAN’T EXPECT ONE PERSON TO SATISFY ALL OF YOUR NEEDS. I HAVE BEEN TELLING MYSELF THESE THINGS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. I THINK THAT HAS EVOLVED. ON THE OTHER HAND, WITH THE CLOTHES I AM MAKING AND WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO WITH THE COMPANY, I FEEL MORE FEROCIOUS THAN EVER. AND ON THE OTHER HAND, I FEEL FRUSTRATED WITH THIS WORLD’S MORALISM. FOR YEARS, YOU SHIED AWAY FROM ANY POLITICAL CONNOTATIONS IN WHAT YOU DO, AND NOW YOU ARE EMBRACING THEM. RICK OWENS: EVERYTHING IS POLITICAL. I ALWAYS THINK OF THE HUMAN CONDITION, FOR SURE. I DON’T LIKE TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. I NEVER FEEL LIKE I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE GREAT POLITICAL STATEMENTS; THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MY FATHER WOULD DO. I DON’T FEEL LIKE I STUDIED ENOUGH TO HAVE THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY. BUT I DO KNOW, AND I UNDERSTAND HOW TO PROTEST. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT I DO CANNOT CORRECT ANYTHING. IT IS ONLY EVER A PROTEST, BUT THAT CAN BE GOOD. YOU’VE SAID THAT YOU CHOOSE POLITENESS OVER DEFIANCE, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS STRANGE, EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLY MANNERLY AND GRACIOUS PERSON. RICK OWENS: THERE IS A LOT OF DEFIANCE IN WHAT I DO, IN A NICE WAY. WHAT ABOUT THE LAST WOMEN’S COLLECTION? ADMITTEDLY, THE COLLECTION WAS DONE BEFORE PUTIN INVADED UKRAINE, BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO RECONTEXTUALISE THE SHOW BY USING THE MAHLER SYMPHONY RATHER THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF YOUR MORE TYPICALLY AGGRESSIVE SOUNDTRACKS. AT THAT MOMENT YOU CHOSE TO EXALT BEAUTY AS A DEFIANT GESTURE, AND IT WAS STUNNING. WHERE DO YOU FEEL YOU ARE NOW? RICK OWENS: IT WAS ALL SO SAD; THERE WAS A DEFINITE MELANCHOLY TO IT ALL. MELANCHOLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE CONTEXT YOU WERE SHOWING IT IN? RICK OWENS: I HADN’T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. THERE IS A RICH SEAM OF MELANCHOLIA IN MUCH THAT OWENS MAKES. THE SENSE OF LOST WORLDS IS STRONG. HE CAN CONVINCINGLY EQUATE BABYLON IN 2000 BC AND HOLLYWOOD IN 1920 AD. THE COMMON THREAD IS SCALE. THE HUMAN FORM IS ELONGATED, EXAGGERATED, SWATHED TO CREATE AN ILLUSION OF ALMOST SUPERHUMAN GLAMOUR. THE ILLUSION IS OFTEN CONFRONTATIONAL, MONSTROUS, EVEN, BUT THERE IS AN EXTREME BEAUTY IN THE STRANGE. IT WAS LESS EXTREME IN THE LAST WOMEN’S COLLECTION, WHERE EVEN OWENS ACKNOWLEDGED THE CLASSICAL BEAUTY OF HIS BIAS-CUT GOWNS. AN UNWITTING SYNCHRONICITY WITH WORLD EVENTS MADE THOSE DRESSES A PECULIARLY APPROPRIATE FASHION RESPONSE TO THE BOTTOMLESS UGLINESS VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS UNLEASHING TO THE EAST. OLD HOLLYWOOD WAS A FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR YOU. HOW? WHEN? WHY? RICK OWENS: IN MY DAD’S BASEMENT LIBRARY. I REMEMBER IT ALWAYS HAVING A SENSE OF DISSIPATION THAT CORRESPONDED TO HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. MAYBE THE FACT THAT IT WAS BURIED UNDER THE HOUSE. IT WAS ALWAYS SHADOWY. THOSE BOOKS DIDN’T BELONG ON THE REAL BOOKSHELVES IN THE HOUSE; THEY WERE IN THE BASEMENT. IT’S NOT LIKE THEY WERE DIRTY BOOKS. I MEAN, WE HAD THE MARQUIS DE SADE UPSTAIRS; I WAS FREE TO READ THAT. THE SENSE OF OLD HOLLYWOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST POIGNANT THINGS IN YOUR WORK, THE WAY YOU RAVISHINGLY RECREATE THE ATMOSPHERE, THE SHADOWY, BIAS-CUT LANGUOR, THE BEAUTY OF THOSE DRESSES. RICK OWENS: BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIES IN THE BASEMENT. IT WAS THE IMAGERY AND THE ENVIRONMENTS, TOO. THEDA BARA’S BOUDOIR! THAT KIND OF LIFE, THAT KIND OF SCALE. ALL THOSE CECIL B. DEMILLE MOVIES, THE SCALE WAS SO HUGE. LIVING IN THESE MONUMENTAL SETS, THE DRESSES DRAGGING ON THE FLOOR… OH, IS THAT DRESS GOING TO GET DIRTY? PEOPLE WEREN’T ASKING THAT BACK THEN. IT WAS BEYOND THAT. THE WHOLE THING ABOUT FASHION IN LA IS THAT IT DID EXIST IN A HOTHOUSE. IT WAS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FASHION IN THE WORLD IN A WAY, IN THAT PEOPLE SAW IT IN THE MOVIES. RICK OWENS: IT REALLY WAS THE HOLLYWOOD THING – THAT WAS THE ONLY REFERENCE THAT THERE WAS IN LA. NOTHING CONTEMPORARY. I HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT, A BLOCK ABOVE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, PART OF THE TOP FLOOR OF A HOUSE, A BEDROOM, A LIVING ROOM AND A LITTLE KITCHEN. AND I HAD A BLACK T-TOP CAMARO WITH A V8 ENGINE. I HAD SUCH A TIGHT LITTLE DRIVEWAY THAT I DON’T KNOW HOW I GOT IN AND OUT AFTER A LONG NIGHT. NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFULLY, BECAUSE THE CAR ENDED UP GETTING KIND OF SCRATCHED UP. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT SOUTHERN CRESCENT HEIGHTS AND DREAMING OF LIVING THERE, BECAUSE THE BUILDINGS JUST LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF ARMISTEAD MAUPIN, WITH AN ECCENTRIC LANDLADY AND SOMEONE PLAYING PIANO IN ONE OF THE APARTMENTS AND THE FOUNTAIN TINKLING IN THE COURTYARD. IT JUST SEEMED MAGICAL. AND I WAS LIKE: ‘WOW, I’M GOING TO LIVE HERE SOME DAY.’ AND NOW… [A SINGLE OWENS EYEBROW FLEXES AT THE WONDER OF IT ALL]. YOU’D NEVER GO BACK. RICK OWENS: OH GOD, NO! I COULD SEE MYSELF LIVING THERE, BUT ONLY ON AN ESTATE WITH PEACOCKS AND MAYBE A TIGER OR TWO. THEN IT COULD BE GREAT. WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE REPRESENTATION OF OLD HOLLYWOOD? RICK OWENS: MY MAIN ONE IS CLEOPATRA, THE CECIL B. DEMILLE MOVIE WITH CLAUDETTE COLBERT, THE MOST IMPROBABLE CLEOPATRA EVER; YOU COULDN’T HAVE PICKED A WORSE ONE. THE ENTIRE THING IS ENTIRELY RIDICULOUS. THEDA BARA’S REAL NAME WAS THEODOSIA GOODMAN. CLAUDETTE COLBERT’S WAS LILY CHAUCHOIN. NOTHING AND NO ONE WAS REAL IN OLD HOLLYWOOD. IT WAS ALL SELF-INVENTION. ONE OF THE FIRST CONVERSATIONS WE EVER HAD, YOU LISTED EVERYTHING YOU’D DONE TO YOURSELF, LIKE YOU WERE TRYING TO COACH ME TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING I WAS LOOKING AT WAS ENTIRELY ARTIFICIAL. RICK OWENS: NOT ENTIRELY ARTIFICIAL, BUT DEFINITELY ‘MANIPULATED’. SELF-INVENTION. RICK OWENS: YES, SELF-INVENTION. THE FUNNY THING IS, I CAN’T DO FILLERS. I TRIED BOTOX AND I COULDN’T TELL THE DIFFERENCE. I CAN’T GO THERE, BUT I DID STEROIDS FOR A TIME AND THAT REALLY HELPED. IT GOT EVERYTHING IN PLACE. WHAT’S ‘EVERYTHING’? RICK OWENS: BEFORE THE STEROIDS, I HAD SOFTNESS. I HAD SOFT NIPPLES; I HAD KIND OF LITTLE GIRL’S BOOBS, AND SOFTNESS IN THE THIGHS AND BELLY. WHEN I TOOK THE STEROIDS AND WORKED OUT WITH A TRAINER REGULARLY, IT BULKED ME UP AND I GOT REALLY THICK. I HAVE PICTURES OF ME THAT ARE KIND OF SHOCKING. THEN WHEN I STOPPED THE STEROIDS AND DROPPED ALL THE WEIGHT, ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS FRAMEWORK OF MUSCLES AND THE NIPPLES GOT HARDER. IT KIND OF CREATED A SCAFFOLDING INSIDE OF ME. IT WAS PROBABLY 30 YEARS AGO WHEN MY BODY TRANSFORMED. AND THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU DID FOR YOURSELF? RICK OWENS: MICHÈLE GOT ME STARTED. SHE WAS GOING TO THE TRAINER, AND SHE WAS LIKE, ‘YOU SHOULD GO; YOU DRINK TOO MUCH. IT’LL BE GOOD FOR YOUR HANGOVERS.’ SO I DID AND THEN IT JUST KIND OF STUCK. AND THEN WHEN I SAW THINGS CHANGING, IT WAS JUST ADDICTIVE. ALSO, IT JUST FELT LIKE BEING THE BEST THAT I COULD BE, LIKE DOING EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD. PROBABLY AT THAT TIME IT WAS ALSO A SATISFYING SORT OF CONTROL. MORE THAN THE RESULTS OF MY CAREER MAYBE. IT’S NOT LIKE THINGS WERE GOING BADLY, BUT IT WAS JUST INSECURE. YOU DON’T KNOW IF THE WHOLE FASHION BUSINESS THING IS GOING TO WORK OUT. SO CONTROLLING MY BODY WAS ONE WAY OF FEELING IN CONTROL. A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED, THIERRY MUGLER TOLD ME THAT HIS BODY WAS THE THING THAT HE WAS PROUDEST OF – FROM BALLET DANCER TO THAT MASSIVE MAN MOUNTAIN! RICK OWENS: HE WAS SO HANDSOME. THERE IS A RUDOLF NUREYEV BIOGRAPHY ON NETFLIX THAT I HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT WITH THE SOUND OFF. IT’S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL, THE OLD IMAGERY OF HIM DANCING AND LEAPING. SO SAD. RICK OWENS: WHY? I LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND I THINK IT WAS A TRIUMPH. IT WAS JUST GLORIOUS. OF COURSE, THERE IS THE DECLINE AT THE END. THERE ALWAYS IS; THERE HAS TO BE. DO YOU SEE THAT FOR YOU? RICK OWENS: I DO ADMIT THE REASON THAT I AM READING BIOGRAPHIES IS TO SEE HOW THEY NEGOTIATE AND LIVE THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. YEAH, BECAUSE I AM 60, THINGS ARE CHANGING. I AM THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT CHAPTERS. I AM REALLY CONSCIOUS OF HOW PEOPLE DID THINGS. WHEN YOU READ THESE BIOGRAPHIES THAT HAVE A BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND AN END, HAS ANYTHING EVER STOOD OUT FOR YOU ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR LIFE TO BE? WILL IT END WITH PEOPLE LOVING YOU FOR POSTERITY? RICK OWENS: I FEEL LIKE THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN; I’M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT. I HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR ME, AND I FEEL THAT UNLESS I DO SOMETHING INCREDIBLY STUPID, I WILL LEAVE A BODY OF WORK THAT HAS A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND HONOUR. YES, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. THOUGH IT WAS KIND OF SHOCKING TO ME THAT I COULD BE SO EMOTIONALLY VULNERABLE. MAYBE I AM READING THESE BIOGRAPHIES TO REASSURE MYSELF THAT PEOPLE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MESSY, TO REASSURE MYSELF THAT I AM NOT DOING IT ALL WRONG. HOW IS YOUR BALANCE OF APOLLO AND DIONYSUS SITTING AFTER THE PAST FEW YEARS? RICK OWENS: OH, APOLLO, DEFINITELY! I TRIED DIONYSUS AND IT WASN’T FOR ME. IT HAS TO BE APOLLO. DO YOU ACTUALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT LIFE IS STILL CAPABLE OF SURPRISING YOU, JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS SET? RICK OWENS: I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. IN THE BEGINNING, I MAYBE WENT OVERBOARD BUT THIS LAST COLLECTION IS MORE STABILISING. LIKE ALL MY INFLUENCES, I HAVE BALANCED THEM OUT BETTER AND PROBABLY FILTERED THEM BETTER. MAYBE ANALYSING RELATIONSHIPS IN GENERAL FED INTO THAT, JUST LIVING IN MY EMOTIONS MORE THAN I USED TO. I FELT LIKE IN THAT LAST COLLECTION THERE WAS SO MUCH LESS AMBIGUITY THAN THERE IS USUALLY, LIKE YOU WANTED IT TO JUST BE BEAUTY AT ITS MOST BREATHTAKING, RATHER THAN CHALLENGING. RICK OWENS: YEAH, I DON’T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM ACTUALLY. I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT CHALLENGING BEAUTY; I DO REACT AGAINST THE STANDARDS OF BEAUTY. THE LAWS ARE SO RIGID, EVERY ADVERTISEMENT, EVERY INSTAGRAM POST – THERE IS JUST SUCH A NARROW SET OF PARAMETERS OF BEAUTY. I ALWAYS TRY TO PUSH THAT A BIT BECAUSE I RESENT BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO. AND ALSO BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE FEELING LEFT OUT OF THAT WHOLE WORLD, AND THEY WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SO THAT IS WHAT I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO EXPLORE. AND IT IS TRICKY. I CAN’T GO TOO FAR BECAUSE THEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO RELATE TO IT. BUT THIS ONE DID GET PRETTY CLOSE TO CLASSICAL BEAUTY. THOUGH I ALWAYS WANT EVERYONE TO BE COVERED. I WANT THE FREAKS TO BE COVERED, TOO. YOU DO HAVE A FOLLOWING THAT IS A LITTLE MORE INTENSE THAN THE AVERAGE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? RICK OWENS: IT MEANS IT’S WORKING; IT MEANS THAT WHAT I PUT OUT THERE HAS A REASON FOR POLLUTING THE WORLD WITH OUR DYES AND OUR EXTRA FABRICS. WE HAVE AN EXCUSE; WE HAVE A REASON TO BE HERE. I SEE THE KIDS IN IT, AND I AM LIKE, ‘WOW, THEY WEAR THIS STUFF SO BEAUTIFULLY.’ COULD YOU EVER HAVE CONCEIVED OF SUCCESS LIKE THIS? RICK OWENS: NO, I DON’T THINK SO. THOUGH I’M NOT REALLY SURE. THERE IS SOMETHING IN ME THAT REMEMBERS I WOULD BE FRUSTRATED ABOUT HAVING TO BALANCE MY CHECK BOOK, AND THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE. I JUST SOMEHOW KNEW I WOULD NEVER HAVE TO DO THAT. LIKE, OK, I WILL DO THAT NOW, BUT I WILL NEVER HAVE TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE. SO YOU BELIEVE IN MANIFEST DESTINY? RICK OWENS: COULD BE. MAYBE I WAS JUST A SPOILED AND PRETENTIOUS KID FROM PORTERVILLE. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? RICK OWENS: YES, I AM. I GOT MYSELF TOGETHER. I FIGURED SHIT OUT AND I’M NOT SUCH A P SSY WITH THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP THING ANY MORE.

I FEEL THAT HIS WAS A SELF-CONTAINED WORLD THAT I WOULD KIND OF ASPIRE TO. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THAT IS MY OWN PROJECTION, MY FANTASY AND MY INTERPRETATION OF WHO JOSEPH BEUYS WAS, BUT I ALLOW MYSELF TO ROMANTICISE IT BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT MORE FUN. I SUSPECT THAT PEOPLE DO KIND OF THE SAME WITH ME. THEY ARE ROMANTICIZING ME TO FIT THEIR NEEDS, AND THAT’S FINE. I AM HAPPY TO BE SOME KIND OF SYMBOL THAT THEY CAN ELABORATE ON. CONVERSELY, I SEE MYSELF IN THEM, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL ALIKE. THE THINGS I TALK ABOUT IN EVERY SHOW ARE PRIMAL, UNIVERSAL CONCERNS ABOUT EMPATHY, INCLUSION, EXCLUSION, SHAME, PRIDE, SELF-LOATHING, AGGRESSION, AND THE NEED FOR ACCEPTANCE. BY EXAMINING THESE THINGS AND BY DEMYSTIFYING THEM, AND BY ME REASSURING OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE ALL FELT AND EXPERIENCED THEM – THAT IS WHAT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED TO. LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE’S STORIES, SEEING THEM LOOKING SO GREAT IN THE LOOKS WE’VE DESIGNED, AND ANSWERING THEIR QUESTIONS – IT ALL MAKES ME FEEL GRATEFUL THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT TO WHAT I DO. EVERYBODY’S MAIN MOTIVATION IN LIFE IS TO BE LISTENED TO, BY THEIR LOVED ONES, BY THEIR CHILDREN, BY SOCIETY. WE ALL WANT TO BE HEARD, AND TO BE ABLE TO DO SO IS ONE OF THE MOST VALIDATING PRIZES IN LIFE. TO BE PART OF THE LIVES OF SUCH INTELLIGENT AND CULTIVATED PEOPLE IS DEEPLY, DEEPLY EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING. I SENT OUT A MESSAGE AND PEOPLE RESPONDED. THAT IS THE BEST YOU CAN ASK FOR IN LIFE. – RICK OWENS BOB COLLERAN I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK AROUND EIGHT YEARS AGO. I SAW [THIRD EYE BLIND MUSICIAN] STEPHAN JENKINS WEARING ONE OF THE T-SHIRTS AND HAD TO HAVE ONE. I LOVE THE BRAND BECAUSE IT APPROACHES THE SACRED AND HIGHEST DOMAIN OF THE ART WORLD, AND REFERENCES MY FORMATIVE INTERESTS, LIKE FITNESS AND VINTAGE ROCK. IT’S UNIQUE AND THE MOST CREATIVELY POWERFUL READY-TO-WEAR BRAND. HEY RICK, I SEE YOUR BRAND IS EXPANDING INTO FOG MACHINES, STROBE LAMPS AND AESOP PRODUCTS. WHAT CAN YOU SEE IT BRANCHING OUT INTO NEXT AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITHOUT ERODING THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR DESIGN LANGUAGE? RICK OWENS: THAT IS THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION, EXPANSION AND MOVEMENT. YOU WANT MOMENTUM, AND I DON’T KNOW HOW MANY T-SHIRTS WE HAVE TO SELL TO SUPPORT EVERY EXAGGERATED RUNWAY PIECE THAT I MAKE. IT CAN GET A LITTLE TRICKY. I MEAN, THERE IS A LOT THAT GOES INTO SUPPORTING THE CREATIVITY OF THIS KIND OF VENTURE, AND AT FIRST I ALWAYS WROTE THE WHOLE EXPANSION AND COLLABORATION THING OFF AS HYPE, BUT IT ACTUALLY BECAME KIND OF FUN. HAVING BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE ISOLATED MYSELF A BIT TOO MUCH AND THIS WAS A CHANCE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MORE PEOPLE. IRONICALLY, I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AS INCLUSIVE A BRAND AS POSSIBLE, BUT WHEN YOU ARE A NICHE BRAND YOU END UP EXCLUDING A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON’T THINK IT IS FOR THEM. FASHION IS COMMUNICATION – YOU WANT TO HAVE INTEGRITY, BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO BE AVAILABLE TO NEW PEOPLE, THOSE WHO ARE STARTING TO DEVELOP THEIR AESTHETIC BUT DON’T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT DIRECTION TO GO IN. I GUESS YOU WANT TO BE DISCREET BUT AVAILABLE AT THE SAME TIME. I STILL HAVEN’T FIGURED OUT THE RIGHT BALANCE, BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND EXPLORE, AND CAN’T BE SELF-SATISFIED AND REMAIN IN A SMALL CORNER RESTING ON OUR LAURELS. AS FOR THE FOG MACHINE [LAUGHS], THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE COLLAB. I FELT LIKE IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT COLLABS CAN BE, INSTEAD OF JUST HYPE MONEY-MAKING MACHINES. THEY CAN BE INVENTIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT CAN CREATE UNUSUAL ALLIANCES, AND THERE IS SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ALLY YOURSELF WITH SOMEONE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE CONSIDERED BEFORE. THERE ARE BENEFITS AND THERE ARE DISADVANTAGES, WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU’RE BEING EXPOSED TO TOO MANY PEOPLE, BUT, YOU KNOW, AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME, I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 20 YEARS, AND WE NEED TO EXPLORE AND TO PUSH OURSELVES TO HAVE SOME ADVENTURES. THANK YOU, BOB, FOR A VERY NICE QUESTION. THAT OUTFIT LOOKS REALLY GREAT ON YOU, TOO. ERIC COLÓN I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK OWENS THROUGH INTERNET FORUMS AROUND 2013, BUT IT WASN’T UNTIL 2016 THAT I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO WEAR PIECES FROM THE BRAND. TO ME, THE BRAND IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MYSELF IN THE MOST FUN WAY THROUGH EXCITING CLOTHING FROM AN ECCENTRIC DESIGNER WITH A HUMBLE BACKGROUND. WHAT MAKES RICK’S BRAND UNIQUE IS THE CONSISTENT DESIGN LANGUAGE THAT I SEE ACROSS ALL HIS CLOTHING, WHICH BRINGS SYNERGY TO EVERYTHING, EVEN ACROSS SEASONS. AS FOR RICK HIMSELF, I’VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED HOW CANDID AND SELF-DEPRECATING HE IS IN HIS INTERVIEWS ABOUT HIS LIFE, HIS INSPIRATIONS, AND HIS QUIRKS. HEY RICK, IT’S ERIC. THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK YOU, OF ALL THE COLOURS YOU HAVE RELEASED – BLACK, MILK, DARK DUST, DARK SHADOW, THROAT, PEARL, PLUM, TOAD, BEAN, DNA DUST, ALL OF THAT – WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL FAVOURITE? RICK OWENS: WELL, OBVIOUSLY BLACK IS MY FAVOURITE, BUT I LIKE OFF-WHITE, LIKE WEARING OLD WHITE T-SHIRTS, WHICH HAVE A LOT OF CONNOTATIONS FOR ME. YOU KNOW, THE OBVIOUS SID VICIOUS REFERENCE, BUT ALSO SATYAJIT RAY MOVIES, AND INDIAN BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIES MADE IN THE 1930S AND 1940S. THEY TOLD THESE DELICATELY NUANCED STORIES OF FAMILY DYNAMICS IN INDIAN VILLAGES, AND THE PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS WEARING MODEST, DRAPED MUSLIN GARMENTS WITH THESE KIND OF WIDE-NECKED, LOOSE-STRETCH, OFF-WHITE T-SHIRTS. I WAS INTRODUCED TO SATYAJIT RAY MOVIES IN THE 1980S WHEN I WENT TO A FESTIVAL. THEY WERE SO MOVING BECAUSE THE STORIES THEY TOLD WERE SET IN THESE VERY SMALL VILLAGES IN INDIA BUT WERE UNIVERSAL STORIES OF LOVING DYNAMICS; THEY WERE SO TENDER. TO THIS DAY, I STILL HAVE THOSE MOVIES ON AS BACKGROUND IMAGERY BECAUSE OF THE BLACK AND WHITE AND JUST THE BEAUTY. I LIKE THE MOOD THEY SET FOR ME. I WILL HAVE THEM ON WHILE I’M SHOWERING, WITH SOME CLASSICAL MUSIC LIKE OPERA OR SOMETHING. THOSE T-SHIRTS, THAT DINGY WHITE, THAT IS THE COLOUR I LOVE THE MOST, ALONG WITH BLACK. I ALSO LIKE IT WHEN IT’S A BIT TINGED WITH GREY AND BLUE. OVER THE YEARS WE’VE HAD A MILLION NAMES FOR IT, WE’VE CALLED IT DINGE, PEARL, BUT ONE OF THE TIPS THAT I REALLY LEARNED OVER TIME IS THAT IT SHOULD NEVER BE WHITER THAN YOUR TEETH. BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE THE T-SHIRT DIRTIER THAN YOUR TEETH, THEN YOUR TEETH LOOK WHITER. THAT IS MY LITTLE BEAUTY TIP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION, ERIC. THAT LEOPARD-PRINT CHIFFON JACKET YOU’RE WEARING IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS; THE PEARL OF THAT CHIFFON IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE ON THE BLUE-GREY SIDE. IT CAME OUT JUST RIGHT AND I’M GLAD THAT YOU HAVE IT. FINN DELANEY I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK AND HIS WORK WHEN I WAS LIVING IN MY SMALL HOME TOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND. I WAS OBSESSED WITH QUEER CULTURE AND THE CONCEPT OF WHAT CAMP MEANT, BUT THROUGH A MORE SINISTER AND ‘DARK LENS’. MY IDOLS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PERFORMANCE ARTISTS AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS SUCH AS DAVID HOYLE, LEIGH BOWERY, AND PETE BURNS. RICK WAS THE FIRST BRAND I SAW THIS IN, AND I HAVE ALWAYS FELT ALIGNED WITH ITS WICKED SENSE OF HUMOUR, GLAMOUR, AND FIERCE EYE FOR DETAIL. THE IDEA OF HAVING A ‘DARK GLAMOUR’ APPROACH TO FASHION IS INTOXICATING TO ME. I CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF IT. RICK’S CLOTHES ARE SEXY AND COMPLICATED, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY HAVE A POINT OF VIEW. THE BRAND AND RICK HIMSELF HAVE ALLOWED ME TO FIND WHO I AM, AND THROUGH THEM I’VE FOUND A COMMUNITY THAT LOVES QUEER CULTURE AND SIMILAR ART. WE’RE INTERNATIONAL, AND THOSE OLD PUNK OR NEW ROMANTIC CLIQUES YOU SAW ON THE KINGS ROAD (À LA WESTWOOD’S WORLDS END) ARE NOW CONNECTED THROUGH THE WEB, AND WE’RE ALL OVER THE GLOBE. THAT’S WHY RICK IS SO UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT TO MY LIFE. RICK, YOU’VE CREATED A WORLD THAT IS SORT OF INSULAR, BUT YOU HAVE ALSO NOW GARNERED AN AUDIENCE THAT TRANSCENDS GENDER AND AGE GROUPS AND RACE. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE DONE THIS AND HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR AUDIENCE REACTS TO IT? RICK OWENS: THANK YOU, FINN, FOR YOUR QUESTION. I THINK THAT ORIGINALLY I WAS FRUSTRATED AT HOW LIMITED THE STANDARDS OF CONTEMPORARY BEAUTY WERE. I FELT THAT THEY WERE RIGID AND NARROW AND BIASED, AND I’M GOING TO USE THE WORD BIGOTED, AND I THOUGHT I COULD PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT. I DON’T MEAN TO BE STRIDENTLY DIFFERENT, ALTHOUGH IT CAN SEEM LIKE THAT, AND EVEN THOUGH I DON’T MEAN TO, I PROBABLY AM TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE IT TAKES ENERGY TO PROMOTE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT STANDARD. THE IDEA WAS TO BE INCLUSIVE AND TO BLUR THE BOUNDARIES OF RIGID AESTHETICS AND ALLOW MORE THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED BEAUTIFUL. IRONICALLY, I SOMETIMES I THINK I HAVE CREATED THIS WORLD THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON’T FEEL WELCOME IN. I DO REGRET THAT A LITTLE BIT, BUT I DO WHAT I CAN TO TRY AND KEEP IT AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS WHY I AM DOING COLLABORATIONS AND STUFF BECAUSE WE ARE SHOWING A DIFFERENT PART OF OUR WORLD – WE ARE OPEN. WE HAVE NO BARRIERS; WE ARE FRIENDLY. FINN, I THINK YOU ARE WEARING A JUMPSUIT, I CAN’T REALLY TELL, BUT I REALLY LOVE THAT FABRIC. IT REMINDS ME OF COTTON-CANDY TWILL, A VERY LOOSELY WOVEN SILK POLYAMIDE THAT GIVES IT AN AIRY BIZARRE NYLON FEELING. IT LOOKS GREAT ON YOU, AND I AM GLAD YOU GOT THAT. FIONA LUO I FIRST SAW RICK’S WORK ON TUMBLR AROUND 2013. I WORK IN FASHION, AND WHILE I LOVE THE WORK OF MANY DESIGNERS, NO OTHER PERSON OR LABEL’S WORK HAS MADE ME FEEL SO COMPLETELY MYSELF. THERE IS A PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY AND FABRIC, A KIND OF SYMBIOTIC SENSATION THAT I GET WHEN I WEAR THE CLOTHES. THERE IS AN INHERENT COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT THIS IS HOW I AM SUPPOSED TO ACTUALIZE MY BEING. PLUS, IT IS HOW I MET THE LOVE OF MY LIFE! I HAVE ETERNAL GRATITUDE FOR THAT! HEY RICK, SO THE QUESTION THAT I WANT TO ASK IS: WHEN DO YOU FEEL THE MOST TRULY ALIGNED WITHIN YOURSELF, AND WHAT ROLE DOES FASHION PLAY IN THAT? IF IT DOES. I AM SUPER-EXCITED TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, BECAUSE IT IS AN ANSWER I MYSELF AM CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIND. RICK OWENS:HI FIONA, WHEN DO I FEEL MYSELF MOST TRULY ALIGNED? I THINK THAT’S WHEN I AM IN A GARDEN THE WEEK BEFORE I HAVE TO LAUNCH A COLLECTION. I HAVE A REAL SENSE OF PURPOSE; I HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES I THINK, SO I CAN USE WHAT I HAVE GOT TO COME UP WITH THE BEST SOLUTION, AND THE ROLE THAT FASHION PLAYS IN THAT. I DON’T REALLY KNOW ANY MORE IF I AM THINKING ABOUT CLOTHES OR ABOUT A SCULPTURAL, LIGHT ENHANCEMENT KIND OF THING. I AM THINKING ABOUT CLOTHES AND CONSTRUCTION, BUT I AM ALSO KIND OF THINKING ABOUT A SENSE OF BEING. DOES THAT SOUND REALLY SUPER PRETENTIOUS? MAYBE, BUT I THINK ONE OF MY STRENGTHS IS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. YOU KNOW THE PHRASE, YOU CAN’T SEE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES; WELL, I THINK I AM PRETTY GOOD AT SEEING THE FOREST. THE DOWNSIDE TO THAT IS THAT I GET IMPATIENT UNLESS I CAN FIND THE STRAIGHTEST LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B. I DON’T ENJOY THE PROCESSES SO MUCH; I AM VERY GOAL ORIENTATED. SORRY, I KIND OF LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT… YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT WHEN I FEEL MOST CENTERED. THAT PERIOD DURING A COLLECTION WHEN THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY, AND THE RESULTS COULD BE PERFECT, FANTASTIC AND TRANSCENDENT. THAT CREATIVE PERIOD WHERE YOU’RE ABOUT TO EXECUTE SOMETHING AND IT COULD BE THE GREATEST THING YOU’VE EVER DONE – IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE PERFECT – THAT IS A VERY CENTERED MOMENT, WHEN YOU ARE KIND OF PULLING OUT AND APPLYING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE LEARNED. THAT’S A PRETTY DELICIOUS PLACE TO BE, AND I GUESS IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET THERE. YOU CAN’T COUNT ON HAVING IT ALL THE TIME. BY THE WAY, THE DRESS YOU’RE WEARING IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE EVER, WHICH I GUESS MIGHT BE OBVIOUS BECAUSE WE ALWAYS KEEP IT IN THE COLLECTION, AND I FEEL LIKE IT IS A SIGNATURE SHAPE. IT LOOKS VERY PRETTY ON YOU. FRANKLIN LOGAN I AM A 3D ARTIST AND DEVELOPER BASED OUT OF LAS VEGAS. MY WIFE INA – WHO’S ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THIS! – AND I HAVE BEEN INTO FASHION AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, RICK’S CLOTHES, SINCE WE STARTED DATING NEARLY A DECADE AGO. I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK OWENS WHEN I SAW HIS WORK POSTED ON ONLINE FORUMS. I WAS INSTANTLY HOOKED. FASHION TO ME HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT PROJECTING OUTWARD WHO YOU ARE WITHIN, AND HOW THAT SINCERITY CAN ACTUALLY SERVE YOU AS A SUIT OF ARMOUR. THE INITIAL APPEAL OF THE BOLD AESTHETIC IS WHAT DREW ME IN, BUT READING MORE ABOUT HIM, IT WAS THE UNAPOLOGETIC SELF-EXPRESSION WITHIN RICK’S CHARACTER THAT HELPED SOLIDIFY HIM AS MY FAVOURITE. ALL OF HIS WORK IS A REFLECTION OF WHO HE IS – AND WE CAN ALL USE A REMINDER TO APPROACH OUR WORK AND OUR LIVES WITH MORE SINCERITY. HEY, RICK. YOU HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT YOU HAVE EACH COLLECTION INSIDE OF YOU AND IT’S JUST A QUESTION OF UNEARTHING IT. BUT THIS THING YOU UNEARTH RESONATES WITH SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. DO YOU FEEL THIS PART OF YOU IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE CULTIVATED OVER THE YEARS? IS IT THESE LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT RESONATE WITH PEOPLE OR IS IT SOMETHING INNATE TO YOU THAT TOUCHES SOMETHING INNATE TO EVERYONE ELSE? RICK OWENS: HEY, FRANKLIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. I DO FEEL LIKE I HAVE EVERY COLLECTION INSIDE ME AND I JUST HAVE TO UNTANGLE IT, BUT THAT CAME AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF ACCUMULATING AND STUDYING A LOT OF IDEAS AND INFORMATION AND VISUALS AND ART AND LITERATURE. AT SOME POINT MY FAVOURITE THINGS STARTED RISING TO THE SURFACE AND I JUST BECAME SOMEONE WHO CREATED COMPOSITIONS OF THOSE THINGS. THESE WERE THINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE RELATED TO, AND THEY APPRECIATED THESE COMPOSITIONS. I THINK OF IT LIKE POETRY, KIND OF LIKE A HAIKU, WHERE YOU SET A FEW WORDS AGAINST EACH OTHER, AND THEY CREATE A MOOD. THAT’S WHAT I THINK I’VE DONE. IT IS NOT AN INNATE THING; I DIDN’T INVENT ANYTHING. I JUST TOOK WHAT WAS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD AND REARRANGED IT TO CREATE MY OWN INTERPRETATION THAT MIGHT BE UNIQUE TO ME BUT WHICH IS FAMILIAR ENOUGH TO A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE, SO THAT ULTIMATELY IT TURNS INTO A THING. I THINK I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A KNACK FOR THAT, IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOME OF US ARE GOOD AT COOKING, SOME ARE GOOD AT SPORTS OR OTHER THINGS. YOU KNOW, NOBODY CAN REALLY EXPLAIN IT COMPLETELY BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE TOO EASY TO REPLICATE, AND THAT’S THE MAGIC. THERE IS MYSTERY TO HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS STAYS UP IN THE AIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION; IT WAS FUN TO ANSWER. JESSIE ZHAO I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK THROUGH MY HUSBAND AROUND FIVE YEARS AGO. I LOVE THE BRAND BECAUSE IT IS UNCOMPROMISING AND ENABLES ME TO FEEL MY MOST CONFIDENT. I HAVE HAD A JOURNEY OF LEARNING AND MAKING FRIENDS AND FAMILY WITH THE BRAND AND THE GREATER ART WORLD. HEY RICK, OUT OF YOUR ENTIRE CAREER, WHAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN YOU FELT MOST PROUD OF YOURSELF? RICK OWENS: HEY, JESSIE. WOW! YOU LOOK AMAZING. THAT’S FROM THE LAST SHOW; MICHÈLE WORE A VERSION OF IT. WHEN WAS I THE PROUDEST? WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW MOMENTS. I THINK, I GOT A LITTLE BIT TEARY AT MY LAST MENSWEAR SHOW, WHEN I PLAYED THIS SISTERS OF MERCY SONG THAT I USED TO LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I WAS IN MY TWENTIES. WHEN I THINK OF THAT PERIOD, WHAT I CAN REMEMBER OF IT, I FELT LIKE I HAD POTENTIAL, BUT I WAS AFRAID OF NOT FULFILLING IT, SO THERE WAS FEAR AND FRUSTRATION, BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I MIGHT NOT MAKE IT. LISTENING TO THAT SONG OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT THE TIME, AND THEN BEING ABLE TO PLAY THAT SONG IN PARIS AT FULL BLAST, WITH REALLY GOOD LIGHTS AND REALLY GOOD MODELS, FOR A COLLECTION THAT I REALLY LIKED… I KIND OF LUXURIATED IN THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING TRAVELLED ALL THAT WAY AND HAVING FULFILLED THE POTENTIAL THAT I THOUGHT I HAD THEN. THAT WAS A VERY SATISFYING AND EMOTIONAL MOMENT. THE OTHER MOMENT THAT COMES TO MIND WAS WHEN I DID A RETROSPECTIVE AT THE TRIENNALE MUSEUM IN MILAN. THEY ALLOWED ME TO CURATE IT MYSELF, SO BEING ABLE TO KIND OF CELEBRATE WHAT I THOUGHT WERE MY SUCCESSES AND ELIMINATE ANY FLAWS OR THE MISTAKES THAT I THOUGHT I HAD MADE. I WAS ABLE TO PRESENT MYSELF AND INTERPRET MYSELF, WHICH FELT LIKE A UNIQUE POSITION. WELL, I GUESS INSTAGRAM IS TOTALLY LIKE THAT: YOU ARE PRESENTING THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE, THE BEST ASPECTS AND THE MOST FLATTERING ANGLES, AND YOU ARE CREATING. I DON’T THINK ANYONE ELSE WOULD THINK OF INSTAGRAM THIS WAY, BUT WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN I WAS DOING THAT TRIENNALE, THAT MUSEUM RETROSPECTIVE, WAS THAT IT WAS LIKE AN OBITUARY, NOT IN A GLOOMY WAY, BUT RATHER: I AM IN CONTROL OF MY NARRATIVE; I AM ABLE TO SUMMARISE WHO I AM, WHO I WAS, BOTH NOW AND FOR ANY RETROSPECTIVE I MIGHT HAVE IN THE FUTURE. IT FELT MONUMENTAL, SEEING IT COLLECTED ALL TOGETHER; I JUST KIND OF LUXURIATED IN THAT. IT WAS A PRETTY BIG MOMENT FOR ME. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. INA CLAVANO MY NAME IS INA, AND I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK AROUND 10 YEARS AGO NOW. I’M BASED IN LAS VEGAS WITH MY HUSBAND FRANKLIN, AND WE USED TO SHARE RUNWAY LOOKS AND ‘FIT PICS’ OF PEOPLE WEARING AND STYLING RICK OWENS. AS PRE-CAREER KIDS WHO WERE BROKE WE ONLY DREAMED OF HAVING ENOUGH OF HIS PIECES TO FEEL THE MAGIC AND SELF-ASSURANCE HIS CLOTHING RADIATES WHEN WORN. THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY RICK OWENS IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME – THERE IS AN ESSENCE AND TRANSCENDENTAL NATURE IN HIS DESIGNS. IT’S NOT JUST WEARABLE ART BUT A WEARABLE EMOTION. IT FEELS LIKE ARMOUR FOR THE EVERYDAY WORLD, EVEN WITH THE SIMPLEST PIECES. DESPITE THE ENCHANTMENT THAT HIS CLOTHING ENCAPSULATES, IT IS STILL VERY HUMAN – BECAUSE OF HIM, BECAUSE HE IS NOT AFRAID TO ADMIT OR FORGET OR REMIND US ALL THAT HE IS JUST HUMAN. HE CREATES THE BALANCE THAT HE BELIEVES IN AND CONTRIBUTES IT TO THE WORLD. HEY RICK, YOU OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE ANGER OF YOUR YOUTH, AND HOW IT TRULY MANIFESTED IN YOUR ART AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLD. DO YOU THINK THAT THE DEEP ANGER AND PAIN THAT A PERSON CAN’T ESCAPE CAN BE BEAUTIFUL, OR IF GIVEN THE CHANCE WOULD YOU BE RID OF YOURS COMPLETELY? THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. RICK OWENS: HI, INA, GOOD QUESTION. I GUESS I WOULDN’T; I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THOUGH THAT I DON’T OVERINDULGE, BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE PAIN AND DISCOMFORT, AND MINE HASN’T BEEN THAT SPECIAL. I DO WONDER, HAD I BEEN COMPLETELY TRANQUIL AND SERENE AS A CHILD, WOULD THAT HAVE MADE ME NOT HAVE THE ENERGY TO REACT. WHEN I THINK BACK, I AM GRATEFUL FOR SITUATIONS THAT MADE ME WANT TO REACT. MAYBE I JUST ENJOY HOLDING RESENTMENT BECAUSE I AM A SCORPIO, AND WE ARE SUPPOSEDLY RESENTFUL. I THINK THAT TO BE CREATIVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN SENSITIVITY TO THINGS, AND MAYBE I HAVE THAT AWARENESS. WE ALL HAVE OUR STRENGTHS. THERE IS NO RECIPE, BUT I ASSUME THAT WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO CREATIVELY HAS BEEN A RESPONSE TO THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME EARLIER. I DON’T WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I WAS ABUSED OR ANYTHING, NOT AT ALL, BUT I WAS JUST REALLY SENSITIVE, AND I ENDED UP WHERE I SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN. BUT IT ALL WORKED OUT, DIDN’T IT? OH, AND THAT KAFTAN THAT YOU’RE WEARING, I TRY AND PUT IT IN EVERY COLLECTION BECAUSE I THINK IT IS ONE OF OUR PIECES THAT KIND OF SAYS IT ALL. IT’S SEXY AND OPULENT, AND IT TAKES UP A LOT OF SPACE AROUND YOU. IT IS KIND OF FORMAL AND THIS WORLD CAN BE SO INFORMAL AND MESSY. YOU’RE ACTUALLY REMINDING ME THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT DRESS IN EVERY POSSIBLE FABRIC IN THE COLLECTION, SO THANK YOU FOR WEARING IT. KENNY RUFINO I PROBABLY FIRST HEARD ABOUT RICK OWENS AROUND 2003-2004 BUT REALLY BECAME A FAN A FEW YEARS LATER WHEN THE FIRST NEW YORK STORE OPENED ON HUDSON. THE RICK OWENS UNIVERSE CONNECTED WITH ME BECAUSE I FELT ATTRIBUTES OF THE BRAND THAT HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL TO ME PERSONALLY, LIKE EXPRESSING YOUR INDIVIDUALITY, DEVELOPING A DISTINCT POINT OF VIEW, LIVING WITH YOUR CONTRADICTIONS. HOW RICK AND HIS WORK CONTINUE TO EVOLVE INTO NEW FORMS, INSPIRE DISCOURSE, AND REDEFINE OUR SOCIOCULTURAL MILIEU IS INSPIRING AND RARE. I DON’T KNOW WHERE HIS VISION WILL GO NEXT, BUT I KNOW I’LL BE THERE FOR THE RIDE. HI RICK, IF YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO GO BACK IN TIME AND ASK JUST ONE QUESTION TO ANY ONE PERSON IN HISTORY, WHO WOULD THAT PERSON BE AND WHAT WOULD YOU ASK? RICK OWENS: HI KENNY, I LIKE YOUR LOOK. I’M SURE I SHOULD COME UP WITH SOMEONE WAY MORE INTELLECTUAL AND ESOTERIC, BUT THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO MIND, IS SALVADOR DALÍ, AND I WOULD ASK HIM TO DESIGN MY HOUSE. I AM FASCINATED WITH HOW HE NAVIGATED HIS LIFE. JUST HIS MIND-BENDING WAY OF THINKING, LIKE CREATING THAT SCULPTURE OF ALICE COOPER’S BRAIN OUT OF CROISSANTS AND ANTS. OH, AND WHEN HE SAID, ‘I DON’T DO DRUGS, I AM DRUGS.’ THERE IS A HELMUT NEWTON PICTURE OF SALVADOR DALÍ SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH THAT I LOOK AT EVERY DAY; HE IS IN A WHEELCHAIR WEARING A SATIN GOWN WITH OXYGEN TUBES UP HIS NOSE. I LIKE HIS SENSE OF ABSURDITY AND NO LIMITS, AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, AND DADAISM. I NEVER WANT TO FORGET THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING; YOU CAN SLIP AND SLIDE AND TURN INTO ANYTHING AND TURN INSIDE OUT. I JUST LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT LED BY THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE. I HOPE THAT WAS A SATISFYING ENOUGH ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, KENNY. MATT CAMPO I HAD BEEN MILDLY FAMILIAR WITH RICK’S CLOTHES SINCE 2009, BUT COMING ACROSS THE MEN’S FALL/WINTER 2014 LOOKBOOK SHOT BY RICK CASTRO WHILE BROWSING SOME RANDOM FASHION WEBSITE WAS A REAL EYE OPENER. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I’D TRULY FOUND A CONNECTION WITH THE BRAND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. THE SHOOT WAS SUBVERSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL: STOIC, INTERGENERATIONAL MALE FORM, LEATHER-FETISH AESTHETICS, THE SEVERE CULT-LIKE CLOTHES. I WAS HOOKED AND IMMEDIATELY DIVED DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE INTO THE WORLD OF RICK OWENS. THE BRAND CONTAINS MULTITUDES; I FIND IT THE PERFECT VEHICLE FOR DISRUPTING THE EVERYDAY. EVERY PIECE POSSESSES A LEVEL OF CONSIDERATION THAT CARRIES THROUGH ANY OCCASION OR CIRCUMSTANCE: FROM PEAK COSY PANDEMIC WORK-FROM-HOME DAILY ISSUE TO OBSCENELY SCULPTURAL RUNWAY PIECES. RICK OWENS WORKS AS WELL FOR A GALA DINNER AS IT DOES WHEN JUST POPPING OUT TO GRAB GROCERIES. EITHER WAY, PEOPLE TAKE NOTICE. HEY RICK, OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR CAREER, YOU HAVE REINTRODUCED AND INTERPOLATED IDEAS AND THEMES FROM EARLIER COLLECTIONS, SOMETIMES MANY YEARS APART FROM THEIR DEBUT – IT’S ALMOST A WAGNERIAN SENSIBILITY OF LEITMOTIF. DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE IDEA, PATTERN OR CONCEPT THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM AN EARLIER COLLECTION, AND DO YOU THINK IT WAS MORE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED THE SECOND TIME AROUND? THANKS! RICK OWENS: HEY MATT, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU’RE SAYING BUT I THINK I ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THINGS IN MY TOOLBOX, SO I AM GOING TO REPEAT MYSELF A LOT. I ADMIT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES IN THE PAST WHEN I DIDN’T HAVE FULL CONTROL OF ALL OF MY RESOURCES AND POWERS, SO I HADN’T LEARNED YET HOW TO EXECUTE THINGS IN A CERTAIN WAY. SO IT’S BEEN A PLEASURE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT ANEW FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE, AND REPEAT, MAYBE REPAIR, MAYBE ENHANCE OR JUST ENJOY REPEATING IN A DIFFERENT WAY. I THINK THERE IS A GOOD LESSON THERE – IF YOU HAD A GOOD IDEA ONCE, WHY SHOULD IT DISAPPEAR, WHY NOT REINTRODUCE IT AND WHY NOT CELEBRATE IT? GOOD IDEAS DON’T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE DISCARDED FOR THE NOVELTY OF SOMETHING NEW. IF SOMETHING IS GOOD, IT IS WORTH REPEATING. ONE OF MY BIGGEST LIFE LESSONS IS THAT YOU CAN GO BACK AND REPAIR THINGS, AND THIS APPLIES TO MISTAKES IN RELATIONSHIPS, TOO. I HAVE GONE BACK, AND I HAVE MADE AMENDS TO PEOPLE. THIS ISN’T LIKE A 12-STEP THING – I NEVER DID THAT – BUT YOU CAN THINK BACK ON SOMEONE THAT YOU FELT YOU DIDN’T TREAT AS WELL AS YOU WANTED TO AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. GOOD QUESTION MATT, AND I’M GLAD YOU’RE WEARING THAT TOP, IT LOOKS GOOD ON AND I’M GLAD YOU’RE WEARING THAT TOP, IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU. MICHAEL SMITH I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK OWENS WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE AND STILL DRESSED VERY PREPPY. AT THE TIME I WASN’T A VERY BIG FAN, BUT IN A SHORT TIME I GREW OBSESSED. RICK IS OBVIOUSLY MY FAVOURITE CLOTHING BRAND, AND I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT AND COMFORTABLE IN HIS CLOTHES. THROUGH THE BRAND I HAVE ALSO MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS IN NEW YORK, AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WITH BESIDES CLOTHING TASTE. RICK’S DEFINING FEATURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WORLD BUILDING, HOW HE CREATES A LOOK SO SPECIFIC AND SO RECOGNISABLE THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO OWN ANYTHING BESIDES RICK. EVERYTHING HE MAKES FITS SEAMLESSLY INTO HIS ARCHIVE OF WORK, AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE MANY DIFFERENT STYLES USING JUST RICK. HELLO, RICK. I’M WONDERING IF THERE’S ANYTHING YOU’VE WANTED TO DO WITH YOUR BRAND THAT YOU HAVEN’T BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH YET – LIKE AN OBJECT YOU’VE WANTED TO MAKE OR A RUNWAY CONCEPT YOU’VE WANTED TO DO – AND IF SO, WHAT THAT MIGHT BE? RICK OWENS: HI, MICHAEL, THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS ONE TIME WHEN WE WANTED TO DO A RUNWAY SHOW AND SET THE MODELS ON FIRE. I WAS SURE THAT WE COULD DO IT, AND I PUSHED AND PUSHED AND PUSHED. I KNOW THAT INSIDE THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN THE 1950S, THEY HAD DONE AN INSTALLATION WITH FIRE, BUT FOR SOME REASON WITH CONTEMPORARY LEGALITIES AND SAFETY REGULATIONS, IT JUST WASN’T THE TIME TO SET PEOPLE ON FIRE IN THE GALLERY ITSELF. THEN KANYE DID IT IN A STADIUM SHOW IN THE MIDWEST OR SOMEWHERE; I MEAN A HUGE ARENA, GRANTED. BUT, YEAH, MODELS ON FIRE, I AM DISAPPOINTED I DIDN’T GET TO DO THAT. AS FAR AS COLLECTIONS GO, I SUPPOSE THERE HAVE BEEN INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL BLOCKS IN THE PAST, BUT PART OF THE FUN OF WHAT I DO IS TAKING A SET AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND LEARNING, AND COMING UP WITH A SATISFYING SOLUTION WITHIN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT’S THE PUZZLE AND THE CHALLENGE, AND THERE IS RESTRAINT IN THAT; A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MODESTY, THRIFTINESS AND RESOURCEFULNESS THAT YOU HAVE TO APPLY. PEOPLE SOMETIMES ASK ME IF I EVER WANT TO EXPLORE MORE ARCHITECTURALLY, BUT I AM KIND OF SATISFIED WITH TRANSFORMING THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT I’M IN. I UNDERSTAND THE AMBITION OF ARCHITECTURE, BUT I DON’T KNOW IF I COULD HANDLE THE LACK OF SPEED BECAUSE I AM SO USED TO THE RUNWAY CYCLE. I’VE PROBABLY BECOME ADDICTED TO IT. I TRY NOT TO BE TOO GREEDY, AND I AM TRYING TO DO THINGS WITHIN INTEGRITY. SO, YEAH, I THINK MORE ABOUT EVERYTHING I HAVE GOTTEN MORE THAN WHAT I HAVE MISSED OUT ON, AND I HAVE GOTTEN MORE THAN I EVER EXPECTED OR IMAGINED – I AM NOT COMPLAINING. THANK YOU, MICHAEL. OLIVER SUCHANEK I’M 27, LIVE IN LONDON, AND I’M AN AIRCRAFT ENGINEER. I WAS A BIT OF A SKATER KID GROWING UP, WITH THE GOTHS AND THE SCENE KIDS, SO MY FASHION BACKGROUND IS RIPPED SKINNY DENIM, TRASHED TEES, VANS AND HOODIES. I THINK THE FIRST TIME I BECAME AWARE OF RICK WAS WHEN I WAS AROUND 18 OR 19, WHEN FOR SOME REASON I TUNED INTO THE AUTUMN/WINTER 2013 PLINTH SHOW. IT WAS A EUREKA MOMENT FOR ME WHEN I REALISED THAT CLOTHES AREN’T JUST CLOTHES; THEY COULD BE GRITTY AND DIRTY AND ALL THE THINGS I WAS WEARING AS A KID, BUT JUST DONE DIFFERENTLY. RICK IS AN INSPIRATION AND I’VE STUCK WITH THE BRAND ESSENTIALLY FOR THE 10 YEARS I’VE BEEN INTO FASHION. I’VE DEVELOPED MY TASTES AND MY IMAGE ALONGSIDE RICK AS HE HAS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE ERAS OF HIS COLLECTIONS. IT’S INSPIRED AND PUSHED ME INTO WEARING THINGS THAT I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD POSSIBLY PULL OFF. A BIG PART OF THE LABEL’S UNIQUENESS IS THE CONSTANT DEVELOPMENT AND MORPHING OF ITSELF; YOU CAN SEE PREVIOUS COLLECTIONS IN CURRENT COLLECTIONS, BUT IN A WAY THAT ISN’T DERIVATIVE, STALE OR BORING. HI RICK, I TEND TO JUMP BETWEEN CREATIVE PROJECTS TOO QUICKLY AND I DON’T DEDICATE ENOUGH TIME TO EACH ONE. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF CREATIVE PROJECTS GOING, HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT YOU DEDICATE ENOUGH TIME TO EACH ONE WITHOUT RUSHING? RICK OWENS: HI OLIVER, I DON’T KNOW IF I’M QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I DON’T KNOW IF I’VE MASTERED IT. I AM CONSCIOUS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN KIND OF MOMENTUM TO GET TO A CERTAIN LEVEL AND WHEN YOU DO THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. I DO WONDER IF I AM GOING TO LOOK BACK AND REGRET HOW MANY THINGS I LET SLIP THROUGH; IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT YOU CAN’T HAVE YOUR FINGER ON EVERY SINGLE THING, BUT THERE HAS TO BE AN ELEMENT OF TRUST. I TRUSTED TOO MUCH AT SOME POINTS IN MY CAREER AND THINGS FELL APART, OR I DIDN’T TRUST AT ALL AND HELD THE REIGNS TOO TIGHTLY AND WAS TOO UPTIGHT, AND THAT DIDN’T WORK EITHER. THEN THERE ARE THE TIMES WHEN I FOUND THE RIGHT BALANCE, WHERE I TRUSTED ENOUGH AND ALLOWED PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMFORTABLE WAY, AND I GOT THE RESULTS THAT I WANTED. IT IS A KIND OF A CONSTANT BALANCE YOU HAVE TO TRY AND MAINTAIN, AND IT IS REALLY TRICKY. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR OWN PERSONAL EMOTIONAL INVESTMENTS INTO SOMETHING WITH YOU, AND YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THAT. BEING ABLE TO RESPECT IT AND DIRECT IT AND COLLABORATE WITH THAT KIND OF EMOTIONAL FORCE, THAT IS A FRAGILE AND DELICATE THING. AND IT’S NOT LIKE I AM A MASTER OF IT. BUT GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OF IT OLIVER, THEN YOU ARE ALREADY LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER, AND THAT’S A POSITIVE THING. WILLIAM BRAGGADOCIO IN A PAST CAREER, I WAS A BUYER FOR A CHICAGO BOUTIQUE CALLED GALLERY AESTHETE. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO TRAVEL TO THE RICK OWENS SHOWROOMS AND RUNWAY SHOWS. I NOW WORK IN TV AND FILM PRODUCTION AS AN ASSISTANT COSTUME DESIGNER, BUT I STILL MAKE A POINT OF KEEPING UP WITH THE RICK OWENS BRAND. I DISCOVERED RICK OWENS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I WAS VIEWING SOME COLLECTIONS (EMBARRASSINGLY, I RECALL IT WAS DOLCE AND GABBANA). IT WAS HIS CRUST COLLECTION [AUTUMN/WINTER 2009]. AT THAT MOMENT, SOMETHING FLIPPED ON IN ME. IT FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS, AND IT FELL INTO MY LAP. EVER SINCE, I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY ENAMOURED WITH HIS BRAND. PERSONALLY, RICK OWENS IS ESSENTIAL TO MY EVERYDAY. EVERY PIECE I COLLECT FEELS LIKE ADDING ART TO MY LIFE. IT MAKES MY WORLD FEEL A LITTLE MORE BEAUTIFUL AND SPECIAL. HELLO, MR OWENS, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS A TRANSCENDENT MOMENT IN YOUR CAREER AS A DESIGNER? RICK OWENS: HI, WILLIAM. I HAVE HAD MORE TRANSCENDENT MOMENTS THAN I EVER REALLY HAD THE IMAGINATION TO THINK OF. AS A DESIGNER, PEOPLE SOMETIMES ASK ME ABOUT THE HIGH OF THE RUNWAY SHOW, AND THERE IS A HIGH, BUT TO ME THE RUNWAY-SHOW EXPERIENCE IS ALWAYS ONE OF GREAT PEACE. I FEEL A SENSE OF SATISFACTION, LIKE IT’S A GOOD SOLUTION TO A PUZZLE; LIKE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH A DECENT CONVINCING PLAUSIBLE STORY, USING THE LIMITED RESOURCES AND TIME THAT I HAD. YOU WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS. IT IS NOT LIKE I LEAVE A LOT OF ELEMENTS TO CHANCE, I AM THE ONE THERE GUIDING IT ALONG AND MAKING SURE IT COMES OUT THE WAY I WANT IT TO. I AM NOT SAYING THAT IN A GLOATING WAY BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND I PUT THAT EFFORT IN. IT IS NOT EXACTLY TRANSCENDENT, BUT IT IS DEEPLY SATISFYING BECAUSE EVERYTHING FALLS INTO PLACE, AND YOU GET TO SEE THE FINAL RESULTS. THAT LITTLE EMOTIONAL TRANSCENDENT MOMENT COMES WHEN I FEEL LIKE, ‘OH I HAVE GOT ENOUGH ELEMENTS IN THIS STORY FOR IT NOW TO TRULY WORK.’ I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TRANSCENDENT AND THAT USUALLY HAPPENS A WEEK BEFORE I HAVE TO LAUNCH THE COLLECTION, USUALLY ON A SATURDAY NIGHT, LATE AT NIGHT, IN AN EMPTY FACTORY IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN ITALY, WHEN I AM BY MYSELF. BESIDES THAT, THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES I REMEMBER BEING HIGH ON A DANCE FLOOR, AND FEELING LIKE THAT’S THE MOST TRANSCENDENT THING I COULD THINK OF ON A SATURDAY NIGHT, BUT BEING ALONE IN A FACTORY AND HAVING EVERYTHING FALL INTO PLACE – THAT MIGHT BE TRANSCENDENCE FOR ME NOW.

YET THAT IS EXACTLY HOW RICK OWENS DESCRIBES HIS APARTMENT ON THE VENICE LIDO, PERCHED ATOP A BRUTALIST 1950S HOUSING BLOCK INCONGRUOUSLY IN SUBURBIA, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES WALK FROM THE SCHEHERAZADE FANTASIA OF THE HOTEL EXCELSIOR. “YOU CAN SEE HOW I LIVE,” OWENS SAYS. AND HOW HE LIVES IS ENTOMBED IN WHITE SARDINIAN STONE AND MIRROR, WITH A GYM IN PLACE OF A KITCHEN AND FELT ARMY BLANKETS TACKED TO THE FLOOR IN LIEU OF RUGS. THROUGH THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOWS THERE IS A PANORAMA OF THE LAGUNA DI VENEZIA. OWENS IS A DESIGNER WHOSE CLOTHES HAVE RESHAPED HOW PEOPLE DRESS AT JUST ABOUT EVERY LEVEL. HIS COMPANY IS PRIVATELY HELD — “I COULD JUST BURN THE WHOLE FUCKING PLACE DOWN,” HE ONCE TOLD ME, GLEEFULLY — AND HAS NOT DISCLOSED REVENUES SINCE 2017, WHEN THEY HOVERED AT ROUGHLY $140MN. THAT IS A FRACTION OF THE SALES BROUGHT IN BY CONGLOMERATE-BACKED RIVALS, YET HIS CREATIVE IMPACT IS SEISMIC, LARGER THAN THAT OF MANY FASHION BEHEMOTHS. OWENS’ DRIPPY SILHOUETTES AND SIGNATURE FABRICS — BOILED OR RIB-KNIT CASHMERES, WASHED LEATHERS — ARE OMNIPRESENT IN THE WAY THAT GABRIELLE CHANEL’S TWEED SUITS WERE IN THE 1960S. RICK RIP-OFFS PROLIFERATE ON THE HIGH STREET AND IN HIGH FASHION AND HAVE DONE FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS — ABOUT A DECADE AFTER OWENS STARTED HIS BUSINESS IN 1994. HE WAS WORKING OUT OF LOS ANGELES BACK THEN — IT WAS THERE THAT HE MET HIS WIFE, MICHELE LAMY, AN EXTRAORDINARY-LOOKING FRENCH WOMAN WHOM HE CALLS HUN (AS IN ATTILA) AND WHO NOW WORKS ACROSS VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HIS BUSINESS, INCLUDING HIS FURNITURE LINE, AND HER OWN JEWELLERY LINE, HUNROD. HIS CLOTHES RETAIN A SENSE OF THE CITY’S CASUALNESS AT THEIR CORE. OWENS WAS BORN IN 1961 IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA — A SMALL CITY ABOUT 160 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES. HIS AMERICAN ACCENT IS STRONG, IDEOLOGICALLY AND LITERALLY, DESPITE HAVING LIVED AND WORKED IN EUROPE SINCE 2003. IT’S THERE IN HIS DAILY WARDROBE — USUALLY BAGGY BLACK SHORTS AND VEST, CALIFORNIA STONER WEAR MEETS HAUTE COUTURE. YET IT’S ALSO EVIDENT WHEN HE’S DESIGNING A SLITHERY EVENING DRESS, OR FEATHERED TULLE CAPE, OR A VEST OF IRIDESCENT FISH-SKIN. THEY’RE ALWAYS ROOTED IN REALITY. WHICH IS WHY THE IVORY TOWER IS IRONIC. ALTHOUGH OWENS’ WORK AND WORLD CAN SOMETIMES SEEM STRANGE AND DISTANT, IT IS ACTUALLY EMBEDDED IN A SENSE OF THE HERE AND NOW, WITNESSING HIS TIME. HIS AUTUMN/WINTER 2022 SHOW, STAGED IN MARCH IN PARIS, IS A CASE IN POINT: OWENS CLOSED IT WITH A PAIR OF DRESSES IN THE COLOURS OF THE UKRAINIAN FLAG HAVING, AT THE LAST MINUTE, SWAPPED A CACOPHONOUS, EVEN ASSAULTIVE SOUNDSCAPE — “IT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT LIKE MACHINE GUN FIRE” — FOR THE PLAINTIVE TONES OF MAHLER’S FIFTH SYMPHONY. WHICH, YES, WAS USED IN DEATH IN VENICE. THESE SOUND LIKE SMALL GESTURES, BUT IN AN INDUSTRY THAT WAS BY AND LARGE IGNORING THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT, THEY FELT HUMANE, CARING. OWENS ALSO SMOTHERED THAT SHOW IN FOG — MODELS CARRIED MOBILE FOG MACHINES THAT BELCHED OUT SMOKE AT THE AUDIENCE, PHOTOGRAPHERS HOWLING AS THE MIST OBLITERATED ENTIRE OUTFITS. “IT WAS INTRUSIVE,” OWENS ALLOWS. “LIKE THAT MOMENT OF THINKING ‘A WAR, NOW, IN THIS DAY AND AGE, AFTER EVERYTHING WE’VE LEARNED? HOW IS THAT PART OF OUR WORLD?’ THAT’S KIND OF HOW I FELT THE FOG WAS TOO. AND IT’S PERVASIVE.” THERE IS UNDENIABLY A DARKNESS TO RICK OWENS. HIS FATHER, A SOCIAL SERVICES WORKER, WAS A STRICT DISCIPLINARIAN AND CONSERVATIVE. HE REFUSED TO ALLOW A TELEVISION IN THE HOUSE UNTIL OWENS WAS 16 AND MADE HIS SON READ THE CLASSICS AND LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC — REFERENCES TO HUYSMANS, WAGNER AND PROUST PROLIFERATE IN HIS DESIGNS. SO, HOWEVER, DO NODS TO IGGY POP AND THE RAMONES. HIS DAD WASN’T ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL AT KEEPING THE EVILS OF THE MODERN WORLD AWAY FROM HIS SON. “I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF MY FATHER AS MISANTHROPIC, AND I’VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE HE INFECTED ME WITH THAT,” OWENS SAYS TODAY. “AND SO I END UP OVERCORRECTING AND THEN NOT FORMING ANY OPINION AT ALL, BECAUSE EVERYTHING’S FINE. EVERYBODY BEHAVES THEIR OWN WAY, AND YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THAT. ANYWAY, WHEN I’M MAKING CLOTHES, I THINK WHAT I’M DOING HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN EXPRESSION OF THAT, OF MY EXPERIENCE BEING JUDGED AND MOCKED, AND THAT SENSE OF DISGUST THAT I EXPERIENCED IN A CONSERVATIVE TOWN.” THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION ALSO MADE ITS MARK: OWENS WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL, WHICH EXPLAINS HIS OBSESSION WITH TRAILING ROBES, WITH CINCTURES AND STOLES AND GRAND GESTURES IN CLOTH. HE EVEN ALLIED HIS FOG MACHINES TO BRUTALIST THURIBLES. OWENS HAS RENOUNCED RELIGION FOR HIMSELF, ALBEIT QUIETLY, WITHOUT VIOLENT REJECTION. “I APPRECIATE IT FOR WHAT IT IS,” HE SAYS. “I SEE IT AS A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE DEVELOPED TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT, WHICH I THINK IS A LOVELY THING.” NEVERTHELESS, RECENTLY OWENS HAS BEEN TOYING WITH THE PENTAGRAM, THE FIVE-POINTED STAR OFTEN SEEN AS A SYMBOL OF THE OCCULT. HE HAS CRISS-CROSSED LACES INTO ITS FORM IN A COLLABORATIVE SNEAKER WITH CONVERSE, AND SLAPPED IT ACROSS THE CROTCH OF TIGHTY-WHITEY BRIEFS. EVEN WRITING THAT OUT EXPRESSES OWENS’ WRY SENSE OF HUMOUR, BUT NOT EVERYONE SEES IT THAT WAY. FATHER VINCENT LAMPERT, A PRIEST AND, INCIDENTALLY, THE DESIGNATED EXORCIST OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE OF INDIANAPOLIS, DENOUNCED OWENS’ CONVERSE. HE SAID THE DESIGNS “CREATE A FASCINATION WITH EVIL”. OWENS ROLLS HIS EYES A LITTLE WHEN I BRING IT UP. “I SENSE SOMETIMES THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT I TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. IT’S NOT, IT’S CAMP,” HE SAYS. “THAT PENTAGRAM IS MY CAMP SYMBOL OF REJECTING MORALISM AND JUDGMENT. NO ONE GETS IT. I DON’T BELIEVE IN SATAN. COME ON!” OWENS PULLS OUT THE LAST SYLLABLE, INCREDULOUSLY. OWENS BEGAN HIS BUSINESS WITHOUT FORMAL FASHION DESIGN TRAINING — HE STUDIED FINE ARTS AT THE OTIS ART INSTITUTE OF PARSONS SCHOOL OF DESIGN, IN LOS ANGELES. HE DID, HOWEVER, STUDY PATTERN-CUTTING AT A TRADE COLLEGE, THEN BEGAN TO WORK FOR THE CITY’S KNOCK-OFF MERCHANTS, PATTERN-CUTTING COPIES OF DESIGNER CLOTHES IN CHEAPER FABRICS. OWENS STILL WORKS HANDS-ON ON HIS CLOTHES, DRAPING AND CUTTING, DEVISING SILHOUETTES AND SHAPES. FEW DESIGNERS HAVE THE SIMPLE TECHNICAL SKILLS TO DO THAT, AND IT GIVES OWENS A REMARKABLE LEVEL OF CONTROL. YOU SENSE THAT ACROSS HIS ENTIRE BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES ALL-IMPORTANT PRE-COLLECTIONS AND DIFFUSION LINES LILIES AND DRKSHDW, AS WELL AS A BUNCH OF INCREDIBLE AND HEINOUSLY EXPENSIVE MONOLITHIC FURNITURE. THE LATTER INCLUDES AN ALABASTER BED THAT NECESSITATED ONE CLIENT TO STRENGTHEN THE FLOOR OF THEIR HOUSE TO BEAR ITS TWO-TONNE WEIGHT, AND A ROCK-CRYSTAL TOILET. THE PRICES FOR BOTH ARE AVAILABLE ONLY ON REQUEST, BUT A ROCK-CRYSTAL CHALICE COST $6,000. IT SOLD OUT. COMMERCIAL ISN’T A DIRTY WORD TO OWENS. “I LOVE THAT STUFF SELLS,” HE SAYS. “I WANT IT TO SELL, BECAUSE THAT MEANS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT AND RESPOND TO IT, AND THAT THE MESSAGE MAKES SENSE.” NEVERTHELESS, OWENS ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY OF SELLING SCHMATTES, BUT SELLING THE DREAM. “WE WANT AESTHETIC EXCELLENCE,” HE ASSERTS. PERCEPTIONS OF OWENS CAN BE MISLEADING. HIS CLOTHES ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED AS GOTH, CULTISH, WITH A STURM UND DRANG SENSE OF TURMOIL — YOU CAN MAYBE BLAME THOSE CAMPY PENTAGRAMS AND TRAILING ROBES. IN FACT, HIS COLOUR PALETTES ARE OFTEN DELICATE, MULTI-HUED; HIS MODELS MAY BE JACKED UP ON BOOTS THAT RESEMBLE STAGE COSTUMES FOR KISS, BUT THE CLOTHES COLLIDE GLAM ROCK WITH ARTFUL REFERENCES TO THE INTERWAR COUTURE OF CHARLES JAMES, MADELEINE VIONNET AND ALIX GRES. THEY ARE EXQUISITELY MADE. AND WHILE OWENS HIMSELF CAN SEEM HARD AND UNAPPROACHABLE, IN PERSON HE IS WARM, UNPRETENTIOUS, HUMOROUS AND HEARTFELT ABOUT HIS LOVE OF WHAT HE DOES. “I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY, THE ESSENCE IS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT SUGGESTING OPTIONS TO A VERY NARROW, BIGOTED PERCEPTION OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL,” HE SAYS, OF HIS WORK. “I JUST WANT TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER.” AND SOMETIMES “FURTHER” MEANS A PENTAGRAM, ON THE CROTCH OF A PAIR OF UNDERPANTS. “COME ON,” OWENS SAYS, AGAIN, LAUGHING UNEXPECTEDLY. “THAT’S HILARIOUS.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

HERE WE DISCUSS THE BALANCE BETWEEN CLOTHING AND ART WITH OWENS AND BOBBY WHAT DO THE FIRST 30 MINUTES OF YOUR DAY LOOK LIKE - YOUR MORNING ROUTINE? RO: I AM AT THE SEASIDE IN VENICE RIGHT NOW - I TAKE MY COMPUTER TO THE TERRACE OVERLOOKING THE ADRIATIC AND DRINK COFFEE, READ THE NEWS AND RESPOND TO EMAILS - I ALSO STUDY STUDIO RESULTS FROM THE DAY BEFORE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT OR ELIMINATION…THEN I GO TO THE BEACH. TELL US ABOUT THE STRATEGY FOR LAUNCHING IN THE REGION? RICK OWENS: NO STRATEGY AT ALL - JUST FINDING A STRONG PARTNER WITH A GOOD TRACK RECORD. BC: WE’VE BEEN WORKING WITH RICK OWENS FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS IN THIS REGION SINCE THE DAY WE OPENED OUR STORES. WE HAVE SEEN THE BRAND GROW FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH AND DECIDED TO INVEST IN IT AND OPEN THE FIRST MONO-BRAND STORE IN THE MENA TO CATER TO THE HEAVY DEMAND. THE CORE DNA OF RICK OWNS REMAINS PREVALENT SEASON AFTER SEASON. HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE THIS? RO: MY CLOTHES ARE ABOUT COLLAPSE AND CONTROL- THEY ARE SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE ATTRACTED TO BOTH AND TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE…AND I LIKE A VERY NARROW RANGE OF COLORS…OR - EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, A MAD RIDICULOUS DEPARTURE FROM THAT. WHAT IS YOUR DESIGN PROCESS AND WHAT INSPIRED THE LATEST COLLECTION? RO: MY COLLECTIONS ARE A ROLLING ALONG PROCESS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT OUR CURRENT AESTHETIC CLIMATE AND TRIES TO OFFER SOMETHING APPROPRIATE FOR THE MOMENT BUT ALSO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. POPULAR CULTURE CAN BE SO NARROW AND CRUEL…BLURRING THE EDGES OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE IS A VOTE FOR TOLERANCE AND EMPATHY. IF YOU WEREN’T A DESIGNER, IS THERE ANOTHER AVENUE YOU WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED CAREER-WISE? RO: I WOULD WANT TO BE THE HEAD GARDENER AT THE VATICAN. HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN CLARITY IN YOUR LIFE AND WORK PRACTICE? HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE CREATIVE AND COMMERCIAL SIDES OF THE BUSINESS? RO: I RUTHLESSLY REDUCE, ELIMINATE AND RELEASE - I AVOID EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL CLUTTER. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE CREATIVE AND COMMERCIAL SIDES OF THE BUSINESS? RO: THEY ARE THE SAME - EVERY COMMERCIAL ELEMENT IS AS CONSIDERED AS ANY RUNWAY PIECE - AND I HAVE PARTNERS, ELSA, AND LUCA, WHO HAVE BEEN WITH ME FROM THE BEGINNING AND ARE SPECTACULARLY TALENTED AT PROTECTING AND CULTIVATING OUR BRAND. HOW DO YOU STAY RELEVANT OVER TIME AND HOW DOES THIS INCLUDE NEW WAYS OF COMMUNICATING IN AN EVER-DIGITAL WORLD WITH CLIENTS? RO: I CREDIT TENACITY AND HONESTY. AND IF THE PRODUCT PEOPLE BUY IS NOT GOOD, NO AMOUNT OF EXPLAINING OR PROMOTION IS GOING TO MAKE IT LAST VERY LONG. BC: BY STAYING TRUE TO OUR DNA. COMMUNICATION IS BUILT ON TRUST, WHICH IS BASED ON OUR STORES – PROVIDING A UNIQUE PRODUCT AND MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE. DO YOU SEE ANY BUYING PATTERNS BOTH GLOBALLY AND WITHIN THE GCC? RO: I DON&#39;T MEAN TO BE OBLIVIOUS BUT IF I JUST CONCENTRATED ON DOING WHAT WAS POPULAR, WE WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT COMPANY. I AM CONSCIOUS THAT I HAVE TO BE VERY SELFISH SOMETIMES AND JUST PRESENT WHAT I AM PROUD OF. BC: WE PUT OUR FAITH IN RICK OWENS AND TRUST THE WAY THE COLLECTION UNVEILS, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE CLIENTS’ SELECTIONS. WHICH PIECES DRIVE SALES SEASON AFTER SEASON? RO: REDUCING WHAT I DO TO JUST THOSE PIECES WOULD FEEL LIKE A VERY INCOMPLETE PICTURE. I WILL LET OTHERS SUMMARIZE ME. BC: IT’S NOT A PIECE, IT’S ABOUT THE COLLECTION AND THEME OF THE SEASON. THE RICK CUSTOMER KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME ISN’T AFRAID TO EXPERIMENT WITH NEW INNOVATIONS. DO YOU FEEL BRICKS AND MORTAR STORES ARE STILL ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORT THE DIGITAL OFFERING AND WHAT DO YOUR CUSTOMERS VALUE ABOUT THESE PHYSICAL LOCATIONS? RO: WE WILL ALWAYS NEED CHURCHES, MOSQUES, MUSEUMS AND THEATERS. PHYSICAL STORES SERVE MUCH THE SAME PURPOSES. BC: RICK OWENS IS MORE THAN A CLICK ON THE SCREEN, IT’S ABOUT A WHOLE EXPERIENCE, WHICH WE TRY TO OFFER IN THE BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES. WHAT ADVICE CAN YOU GIVE ASPIRING DESIGNERS? RO: THE MORE WORK YOU PRODUCE, THE MORE YOU CAN STRIP AWAY AND EDIT- AND YOUR VOICE WILL EMERGE FOR BETTER OR WORSE. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR YOUNGER SELF? RO: DRINK MORE WATER.

FORMING A BARRIER BETWEEN THE LAGOON AND THE ADRIATIC SEA, THE HOTEL EXCELSIOR IN VENICE LIDO, OPENED SINCE 1908, IS ONE OF THOSE MAGICAL HAVENS THAT OVER DECADES HAS ATTRACTED POLITICIANS, POETS, AND ARTISTS. IT IS ALSO THE PLACE WHERE AMERICAN DESIGNER RICK OWENS HAS SPENT HIS SUMMERS FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS, AND THEREFORE, THE LOCATION FOR OUR ZOOM INTERVIEW. OWENS, FROM HIS BREEZY BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE WATER AND ME, FROM VOGUE ARABIA’S OFFICE IN DUBAI. “SERGEI DIAGHILEV DIED IN THIS HOTEL, AND STRAVINSKY WAS ALSO A GUEST, ALONGSIDE JEAN COCTEAU. THEY ARE ALL FROM MY FAVORITE PERIOD, WHICH IS STILL VERY PRESENT IN THIS SPACE,” HE TELLS ME, WITH HIS FACE TANNED, FRAMED BY HIS SIGNATURE LONG, GOTHIC BLACK HAIR. “I HAVE A BEACH CABANA HERE AT THE EXCELSIOR, WITHOUT ELECTRICITY BUT WITH A DESK AND A COUPLE OF DAY BEDS, WHERE I GET MY EMAILS DONE WHILE STARING AT THE WATER. IT IS QUIET AND VERY GHOSTLY IN A WAY. THERE’S NO MUSIC, AND THERE ARE MOSTLY OLD FAMILIES WHO HAVE LIVED IN VENICE FOREVER. IT IS NOT LIKE THE BEACH CLUBS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD, LIKE MYKONOS, WITH BOTTLE SERVICE, A LOUD DJ, AND A WHOLE SOCIAL LIFE. I CERTAINLY DO NOT DISAPPROVE OF IT, AS I THINK WE ARE PUT OUT IN THE WORLD TO HAVE FUN, BUT THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT.” THIS SUMMER, OWENS IS ACCOMPANIED BY A VERY SPECIAL GUEST, HIS 89-YEAR-OLD MOTHER. “DO YOU HAVE ELDERLY PARENTS?” HE ASKS. “IT IS AN INTERESTING PERIOD… BUT WE ARE HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME IN ITALY, SWIMMING IN THE ADRIATIC SEA.” EVERY TIME I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE DESIGNER IN THE PAST, I’VE DISCOVERED A SIDE OF OWENS THAT USUALLY GETS SHIELDED BY HIS HIGH HEELED, “DON’T MESS WITH ME” LOOK. HIS SHOWS CAN ALSO PROJECT A DISTANCING ENERGY, WITH MODELS MANY TIMES TRANSFORMED INTO CREATURES FROM A DIFFERENT GALAXY. BUT WHEN IN PRIVATE, THE DESIGNER BLOSSOMS AS A KIND AND EMPATHETIC MAN, WITH ENCYCLOPEDIC CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE, AND A SERIOUS PASSION FOR MUSEUMS, ARCHITECTURE, MUSIC, AND EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION. HE IS ALSO GIFTED WITH A VERY SHARP, NO-NONSENSE VIEW OF THE WORLD. I CLEARLY JUDGED THE BOOK BY ITS COVER. BUT LET’S REWIND… BORN IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, OWENS STUDIED PAINTING AT THE OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN, INFLUENCED BY HIS PERSONAL “HEROES” JULIAN SCHNABEL AND JOSEPH BEUYS. HOWEVER, HE DECIDED TO DROP OUT FROM HIS ART STUDIES, FEARING NOT POSSESSING THE “INTELLECTUAL RIGOR TO BE AN ARTIST,” OR EVEN THE CAPACITY TO PROPEL HIMSELF POLITICALLY TO GET THE RIGHT RECOGNITION. OWENS ENDED UP ENROLLING IN A TRADE SCHOOL, TO LEARN HOW TO CUT PATTERNS AND MAKE CLOTHES. “I THOUGHT THAT EVEN IF I DIDN’T MAKE IT TO [BEING A] DESIGNER, I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A JOB AS SOMEBODY THAT CAN LABOR IN A FACTORY. IT WAS NOT ABOUT CREATING MY BRAND, ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT,” HE RECALLS. HOWEVER, IN THE EARLY NINETIES, OWENS STARTED DROPPING HIS COLLECTIONS INDEPENDENTLY, CREATING A UNIQUE AESTHETIC THAT GRABBED THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL BOUTIQUES SUCH AS MARIA LUISA, BROWNS, AND MAXFIELD. HIS SIGNATURE PIECES WERE BIAS GOWNS, DRAPED T-SHIRTS, AND ITEMS SOURCING RECYCLED ARMY SURPLUS. “I STARTED OUT VERY COMMERCIALLY, AND I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED DOING RUNWAY SHOWS, AS I NEVER THOUGHT I’D EVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM,” HE REVEALS. “I THOUGHT I WOULD BE AN ECCENTRIC DESIGNER WHO SHOWED MY COLLECTIONS IN HOTELS, MAYBE IN PARIS, AND I WAS LUCKILY WELL CONNECTED TO A SMALL INDEPENDENT NETWORK OF PIONEERING BUYERS, WHO TOOK CHANCES ON THEIR DESIGNERS. I DON’T KNOW WHO TAKES THOSE KINDS OF RISKS ANYMORE…” EVEN IF THE PLAN WAS TO “PRODUCE TINY COLLECTIONS TO HAVE A MODEST WAY OF SUSTAINING,” EVERYTHING CHANGED IN 2001, WHEN THE AMERICAN EDITION OF VOGUE UNDERWROTE OWENS’ FIRST FASHION SHOW, IN NEW YORK. THIS WAS A NEW REALITY FOR THE CREATIVE, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY ONLY ATTENDED ONE RUNWAY SHOW. “IN LOS ANGELES WE DON’T DO FASHION SHOWS… I ONLY EXPERIENCED THAT IN PARIS WHEN I GOT INVITED BY A FRIEND AS A PLUS ONE. WHEN I ENTERED THE ROOM, I JUST SAT IN THE FRONT ROW, AS I DIDN’T KNOW THE SEATS WERE NUMBERED. NOBODY IS THAT DUMB… OF COURSE, SOMEONE JUST SNAPPED AT ME,” HE LAUGHS. “THE SHOW ENDED UP BEING DEPRESSING. I WAS WOWED, THINKING I COULD NEVER RECREATE SOMETHING SO GLORIOUS. IT WAS A WORLD BEYOND ME, AND I HAD LEARNED TO BE SATISFIED WITH MY OWN STUFF.” THE DESIGNER EVENTUALLY GATHERED THE STRENGTH TO SET UP HIS RUNWAY PRESENTATIONS, WINNING THE PERRY ELLIS AWARD FOR EMERGING TALENT AT THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA (CFDA) AWARDS IN 2002. “LUCKILY, I ALWAYS RECEIVED POSITIVE FEEDBACK, OR MAYBE I WAS DELUSIONAL ENOUGH TO ALWAYS SEE THE POSITIVE SIDE – OR ARROGANT ENOUGH TO DISMISS THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK,” HE REFLECTS. “I’VE ALWAYS BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THE ACCEPTANCE I’VE GOT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I’M NOT ALWAYS PROMOTING THE MOST POPULAR THING IN THE WORLD. BUT I ALWAYS HAD AN HONORABLE LITTLE PROJECT, AND GREAT PEOPLE TO HELP ME EXECUTE. I DON’T FOOL MYSELF; I KNOW I’M NOT A GENIUS… I HAVE GOOD IDEAS, BUT ALSO MANY GREAT PARTNERS.” RICK OWENS’ RELOCATION TO EUROPE HAPPENED IN 2003, FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, AND TO EXPLORE NEW OPPORTUNITIES. THE BRAND STARTED TO BE PRODUCED IN ITALY, IN A FACTORY IN CONCORDIA SULLA SECCHIA, AND THE GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS REQUIRED A CLOSER INTERACTION WITH THE MANUFACTURER. TWO DECADES LATER, OWENS STILL PRODUCES IN THE SAME LOCATION, AND EVENTUALLY BOUGHT THE FACILITIES IN 2016. A YEAR BEFORE THE MOVE TO FRANCE, THE DESIGNER HAD ALSO BEEN APPOINTED AS CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEGENDARY FUR COMPANY REVILLON, FOUNDED IN 1723, AND “EVEN MENTIONED BY PROUST,” AS OWENS HIGHLIGHTS. “I WAS ATTRACTED BY THE LEGEND AND REPUTATION OF THIS BRAND. IT WAS NOT ABOUT THE MONEY, AS THERE WAS REALLY NO MONEY THERE,” HE SHARES. “WHAT I DIDN’T CALCULATE WAS THAT I RECEIVED INSTANT CREDIBILITY, AS MY APPOINTMENT IMPRESSED PEOPLE IN FASHION. IF I HAD COME ON MY OWN TO PARIS AS AN AMERICAN, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUS, AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. THIS WAS A SERIOUS AND GLAMOROUS JOB THAT GAVE ME AN EDGE.” TODAY, WHAT STARTED AS A SHY ENDEAVOR BECAME A WORLDWIDE EMPIRE, WITH THE RICK OWENS BRAND BEING SOLD ACROSS 500 STORES, AND STAGING SPECTACULAR RUNWAY SHOWS IN PARIS. THIS WAS THE CASE OF THE LATEST FALL/WINTER 2022 SEASON REVEALED AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO AND PHOTOGRAPHED IN THIS ISSUE AGAINST ICELAND’S DRAMATIC LANDSCAPES. IN THE SHOW NOTES, OWENS STATES THAT FASHION IS ALL ABOUT COMMUNICATION, AND IT CAN BE USED AS A GRACIOUS WAY TO MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD. BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN? “CLOTHES ARE STATUS SIGNIFIERS, AND NO MATTER HOW RESTRAINED, THEY ALWAYS GIVE YOU SUBTLE SYMBOLS OF WHAT YOUR VALUES ARE. I CAN’T REALLY TELL YOU HOW THE CUT OF A SHOULDER RELATES TO A CERTAIN SYSTEM, BUT AS AN EDITOR OF VOGUE, YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN,” HE SAYS. COMPRISING 51 LOOKS, REVEALED BY MODELS WALKING THROUGH A CLOUD OF SMOKE, THE COLLECTION FEATURED BIG PUFFER JACKETS, POINTY SHOULDER LOOKS, AND SKIN-HUGGING SKIRTS, TOUCHING THE FLOOR. HOWEVER, IT WAS THE SCULPTURAL, SEQUINED EVENING DRESSES THAT REALLY CAUGHT OUR EYE, SHOWCASING A MORE ELEGANT FACET OF THE DESIGNER’S UNIVERSE. “I’M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A BARBARIC ELEGANCE BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY PRIMAL EXPERIENCES THAT WE ALL SHARE, AND THAT WE ALL RESPOND TO, SUCH AS REJECTIONS, LOVE… I’M TRYING TO TOUCH ON THOSE,” HE EXPLAINS. “THIS PARTICULAR SHOW CAME DURING A VERY DELICATE TIME, REACTING TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. INITIALLY, THE MUSIC WAS GOING TO BE VERY VIOLENT AND BOMBASTIC, BUT I CHANGED IT AT THE LAST MINUTE AS I NEEDED THE MOOD TO COMPLETELY COLLAPSE INTO BEAUTY. THE SHOW HAD TO BE VIOLENTLY BEAUTIFUL TO COUNTERBALANCE THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF WAR. WAR ENTERING OUR LIVES AGAIN, AFTER EVERYTHING THAT THE WORLD HAS LEARNED… WITH MAHLER’S SYMPHONY IN THE BACKGROUND, I WANTED THINGS TO BE SUMPTUOUSLY STRIKING, AS THE STRONGEST EXPRESSION I COULD FIND IN PROTEST.” THIS COLLECTION – AND ALL THE OTHER LINES OF THE HOUSE – WILL BE AVAILABLE IN DUBAI AT THE BRAND’S FIRST FLAGSHIP STORE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, JUST OPENED AT THE DUBAI MALL. SPEAKING OF BEAUTY, OWENS VERY OFTEN GENERATES HEADLINES DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF HIS CASTING, BUT ALSO THE DARING BEAUTY HE PROMOTES. MODELS HAVE WALKED THE RUNWAY WITH THEIR FEATURES MODIFIED WITH PROSTHETIC MAKEUP, SPORTING FULLY SHAVED HEADS, AND BLACK CONTACT LENSES. AS A GUEST, IT ALL CAN LOOK FRANKLY INTIMIDATING AT TIMES. WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT IS BEHIND HIS PROVOKING AESTHETICS, OWENS IMMEDIATELY REFUTES THE CONCEPT OF BEAUTY IN TRADITIONAL POP CULTURE, AND WHAT HE CALLS “AIRPORT BEAUTY.” “WHEN I WALK IN AN AIRPORT AND I SEE ALL THE MAKEUP ADVERTISING, I DON’T SUBSCRIBE TO THAT VERY NARROW DEFINITION OF BEAUTY. WHEN I STARTED MY OWN COLLECTION, I WANTED TO OFFER ALTERNATIVES, NOT BECAUSE I’M AGAINST CLASSICAL BEAUTY, BUT BECAUSE I WANTED TO OFFER OPTIONS IF YOU DON’T FIT INTO THIS IDEAL. I FELT THAT THIS WAS A KIND AND HONORABLE THING TO DO, AND A RESPONSIBLE WAY TO FRAME MY WORK.” DIGGING MORE INTO HIS PAST, OWENS ALSO CANDIDLY SHARES THAT HIS WHOLE AESTHETIC WAS DEFINED BY HIS DIFFICULT CATHOLIC CHILDHOOD. “I WAS RAISED IN A SMALL, JUDGMENTAL, AND DISAPPROVING TOWN, WHERE I HAD TO EXPERIENCE A LOT OF SHAME.” TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT HE UNDERWENT AND HIS TEEN STRUGGLES, I SUGGEST THAT EVERYONE BACK AT HOME MUST BE VERY PROUD OF THE DESIGNER, AS HE HAS BUILT ONE OF THE MOST CONSISTENT, RECOGNIZABLE, AND WELL-RESPECTED GLOBAL FASHION BRANDS. “THEY PROBABLY JUST THINK OF MYSELF AS A CELEBRITY, AND THAT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,” HE ANSWERS DISMISSIVELY. “I’M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM WHERE I COME FROM THAT WOULD LAUGH AT MY CLOTHES, IF THEY SAW THEM OUT OF THE CONTEXT OF THE CELEBRITY CONNECTION. BUT THAT’S ME NOT BEING GENEROUS,” HE LAUGHS. HOWEVER, NOW WITHOUT SARCASM, THE DESIGNER CONFIDES THAT HE FELT ESPECIALLY PROUD WHEN, IN 2017, HE COLLECTED THE CFDA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD, ONE OF THE HIGHEST HONORS FOR ANY AMERICAN DESIGNER. “I’VE NEVER REALLY BEEN IN THAT WORLD, AND I NEVER WENT OUT OF MY WAY TO PARTICIPATE. SO BEING RECOGNIZED OUT OF THE BLUE… THAT WAS VERY VALIDATING. I WAS SURPRISED AS I UNDERSTOOD THAT I BECAME MORE VISIBLE THAN I THOUGHT, OUT OF MY NICHE. IT WAS TOUCHING, AS I STOOD IN FRONT OF A ROOM FULL OF CULTIVATED PEOPLE, WHO EXPECT THE VERY HIGHEST OF THAT WORLD.” BESIDES THE AWARDS, I ASK OWENS HOW HE FEELS WHEN HE EXPERIENCES THE LOVE OF HIS FANS. THE BRAND HAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST LOYAL AND DEDICATED FOLLOWINGS IN FASHION, WITH CONSUMERS READY TO GO THE EXTRA MILE TO GET THAT RICK OWENS LOOK, FROM HEAD TO TOE. JUST PASS IN FRONT OF ONE OF HIS SHOWS DURING FASHION WEEK, AND YOU WILL EASILY SPOT A FLAMBOYANT ARMY OF DARING DRESSERS, MOSTLY ALL CLAD IN BLACK. “I DON’T KNOW IF I EVER REALLY EXPERIENCED IT THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE DO AS I’M NOT ACTUALLY IN THAT CROWD, I’M OBSERVING IT FROM A SCREEN, FROM A DISTANCE, IN A QUIET ROOM. AND AT THE END, BY THE TIME I COME BACK FROM THE BACKSTAGE, EVERYBODY IS GONE,” OWENS EXPLAINS, MAKING ME THINK THAT EVEN DURING THE CRAZIEST PERIOD OF THE FASHION CALENDAR, HE WAS ABLE TO FIND SOME SORT OF ALLEGORICAL ISOLATED CABANA, JUST LIKE THE ONE BY THE SEA WHERE HE WAS PROBABLY RELAXING BEFORE THIS INTERVIEW. “I CAN’T INVEST MYSELF IN AN EMOTIONAL COMMITMENT TO IT,” THE DESIGNER CONCLUDES. “MAYBE I DON’T ALLOW MYSELF TO TAKE IT THAT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT CAN ALL BE GONE ONE DAY.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

IN FACT, BEFORE HE TOOK THE PLUNGE, IT WAS AN ENDEAVOUR THAT HE VIEWED WITH “DEEP SCORN”, HE CHUCKLES OVER A ZOOM CALL FROM PARIS, WHERE HE’S SAT IN AN AIRY ROOM IN THE CONCRETE-WALLED TOWNHOUSE HE CALLS HOME. MERCIFULLY FOR ALL OF US, HIS ATTITUDE SHIFTED WHEN HE REALISED THAT — WHILE THEY MAY OFTEN SERVE AS MARKETING GIMMICKS — THEIR CAPACITY FOR INTRODUCING THE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN TO VAST NEW AUDIENCES IS NOT TO BE BAULKED AT; A DECISION THAT HAS SINCE ESTABLISHED RICK AS THE JOKINGLY SELF-STYLED “KING OF COLLABORATIONS”. THE PRODUCTS BORN OF HIS COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MONCLER ARE PARTICULAR STANDOUTS, FUSING HIS DARK, DIRECTIONAL DESIGN SENSIBILITY WITH THE ITALIAN LUXURY BRAND’S ICONIC DOWN PUFFERS. A PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THE LINK-UP SAW RICK AND MICHÈLE LAMY, HIS WIFE, FOUNDING PARTNER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR ART/FURNITURE OF OWENSCORP, TAKE TO THE ROAD IN A CUSTOM-DESIGNED RICK OWENS + MONCLER TOUR BUS, AND REIMAGINE ICONIC RICK OWENS PIECES AND SILHOUETTES — THINK COLUMN-LIKE COCOONING COATS AND WIDE-SET SHORTS — IN MONCLER’S NYLON DUVET. FOR THE LATEST CHAPTER OF THEIR COLLABORATION, RELEASED AS ONE OF SEVEN CO-BRANDED PIECES RELEASED TO TOAST THE HOUSE’S 70TH ANNIVERSARY, RICK HAS INTERPRETED ONE OF MONCLER’S MOST SYMBOLIC PIECES: THE MAYA JACKET. THE COAT — SHOT HERE ON MICHÈLE BY BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER PLATON – IS A RELATIVELY SUBTLE INTERVENTION BY RICK INTO THE WORLD OF MONCLER, BUT IT’S NO LESS IMPACTFUL FOR IT. FEATURING “ARCHITECTURALLY QUILTED SHOULDERS THAT I INTRODUCED IN MY MEN’S AW21 COLLECTION CALLED GETHSEMANE,” HE EXPLAINS, ALONG WITH GAUNTLET-LIKE SLEEVE DETAILS, IT EXEMPLIFIES THE IDIOSYNCRATIC, ARCHITECTURAL AND UNABASHEDLY CAMP DESIGN SENSIBILITY THAT HAS MADE RICK ONE OF FASHION’S MOST INFLUENTIAL FORCES. HERE, TO COMMEMORATE THE JACKET’S LAUNCH, RICK DISCUSSES ITS DESIGN PROCESS, RALLYING AGAINST BANAL “AIRPORT AESTHETICS”, COLLABORATIONS AS “GOSSIP”, AND THE RESPONSIBILITY HE FEELS TO KEEP PUSHING SOCIAL NORMS. DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU SAW SOMEONE WEARING A MONCLER JACKET OR EXPERIENCED ONE IN THE FLESH? WELL, I THINK THE FIRST TIME MUST HAVE BEEN IN ITALY, I DON’T REMEMBER IT HAPPENING IN THE STATES. BUT EVEN IN THE STATES, THAT KIND OF JACKET STILL HELD A LOT OF ALERT FOR ME. I GREW IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH WAS VERY DRAB. BUT WHEN I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL THERE WAS THIS SPECIAL BUS THAT HAD TO GO UP TO CAMP NELSON, WHICH WAS UP IN THE MOUNTAINS NEARBY. IT WOULD PICK UP THE KIDS THAT LIVED UP THERE AND BRING THEM DOWN TO OUR SCHOOL, AND THEY WERE THESE SUPERNATURAL, BEAUTIFUL, FIT, LONG-HAIRED KIDS THAT WORE DOWN JACKETS BECAUSE THEY WERE SKIING ALL THE TIME. THEY WERE KIND OF LIKE THESE MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES — SO BEAUTIFUL AND OTHERWORLDLY. AND SO PUFFER JACKETS HAVE ALWAYS HAD THIS KIND OF ALLURE FOR ME. THEY’VE ALWAYS SYMBOLISED THIS KIND OF POT-SMOKING, SKIING, ELEVATED HIPPIE ETHOS THAT WAS COOL, UNPERTURBABLE AND OTHERWORLDLY. WHEN I CAME TO EUROPE AND SAW PEOPLE IN THEIR MONCLER JACKETS, THAT WAS MY IMMEDIATE PERSONAL ASSOCIATION. HOW DID COLLABORATING WITH MONCLER FIRST CAME ABOUT? I’VE ALWAYS HAD PUFFER JACKETS IN MY COLLECTIONS, BUT ALIGNING MYSELF WITH MONCLER WAS SOMETHING I ACTUALLY RESISTED FOR A WHILE. IN FACT, THERE WERE YEARS WHEN I WOULD NEVER DO COLLABORATIONS. THEY’RE ACTUALLY FAIRLY NEW FOR ME. I WAS SO INDEPENDENT AND ISOLATED, IN A WAY, FROM THE REGULAR FASHION INDUSTRY, THAT I WASN’T REALLY SURE WHAT MY IDENTITY WAS IN THE FASHION WORLD. I FELT LIKE I DIDN’T WANT TO MUDDY MY IDENTITY BY COLLABORATING — I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO FIRST ESTABLISH WHAT I STOOD FOR AND WHAT I DID, AND I DIDN’T WANT IT TO DILUTE IT. I ALSO JUST HAD EXTREME SCEPTICISM REGARDING ANY KIND OF COLLABS. THEY OFTEN JUST SEEM LIKE PUBLICITY STUNTS, AND CAN EVEN FEEL A BIT DESPERATE. THAT WAS A WORLD I JUST WASN’T INTO, A WORLD OF HYPERBOLE. BUT A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT, I REALISED THAT I HAD ESTABLISHED AN IDENTITY, AND I’D REACHED A NEW COMFORT LEVEL WITH MY PRODUCTION AND WITH THE WAY I PRESENTED MY RUNWAY SHOWS — I STARTED PLAYING A BIT MORE. MY FIRST RUNWAY SHOWS USED TO BE VERY SERIOUS AND VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD, BUT I THEN GRADUALLY LOOSENED UP AND STARTED DOING LOOSER, MORE EXTREME THINGS. I BECAME LESS THREATENED BY THE IDEA OF HAVING MY IDENTITY PERCEIVED DIFFERENTLY THROUGH COLLABORATIONS, AND I THEN STARTED PURSUING THEM AVIDLY! I FINALLY FELT READY TO COME OUT OF MY CORNER AND PLAY A LITTLE BIT. I WAS READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD, TO MEET NEW PEOPLE AND ENGAGE IN NEW SYSTEMS. I WAS READY TO PARTICIPATE, AND PARTICIPATING IN THE WORLD IS A VERY VALIDATING EXPERIENCE — YOU’VE ENGAGED, YOU’VE LISTENED AND YOU’VE BEEN LISTENED TO. SO I THOUGHT THAT COLLABORATING WOULD OFFER ME THE CHANCE TO PUSH ALONG MY LITTLE ETHOS, WHICH CONSISTS OF SUGGESTING DIFFERENT FORMS OF BEAUTY THAT BEND WHAT I PERCEIVE AS VERY NARROW, CLASSICAL, RIGID STANDARDS OF CONTEMPORARY BEAUTY. OR WHAT I LIKE TO CALL “AIRPORT AESTHETICS”. WHY’S THAT? WELL, BECAUSE WHEN YOU’RE IN AN AIRPORT, YOU ARE HERDED THROUGH ALL THESE PERFUME DISPLAYS THAT PROMOTE A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF VALUES. A SPECIFIC, RIGID SET OF AMBITIONS AND IDEAS AROUND SEXUALITY, PHYSICAL BEAUTY, PERSONAL APPEARANCE, BODY TYPE. IT’S ULTIMATELY A LITTLE BIT CRUEL — NOT EVERYBODY CAN BE ON A YACHT IN CAPRI WITH WASHBOARD ABS, ABOUT TO HAVE SEX WITH SOMEBODY SPECTACULAR! I’M NOT SAYING THAT THESE ARE IDEAS THAT NEED TO BE ELIMINATED, I JUST WANTED TO BE SOMEBODY WHO PROVIDES OTHER OPTIONS. I TRY AND DO THAT WITH MY SHOWS, AND WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. I TRY TO PRESENT AN OTHERWORLDLY, QUEER WORLD THAT I LIKE TO THINK HELPS TO BALANCE OUT JUDGMENTAL MORALISM IN THE WORLD. THAT MAY SOMETIMES MEAN THAT I GO TOO FAR, OR I MIGHT BE TOO EXTREME, BUT THAT’S OK! JUDGMENTAL MORALISM GETS SUPER EXTREME, TOO. IF I WANT TO DO FISTFUCKING VIDEOS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK IT BRINGS A BIT OF CHEERFUL DEGENERACY THAT COUNTERBALANCES EXTREMELY MORALISING NARRATIVES AND THAT’S A GOOD THING. WHAT PROMPTED THAT SHIFT? IN DECIDING TO ALIGN WITH SOMEBODY LIKE MONCLER, I’M DRAWN TO A SENSE OF ADVENTURE. THEIR SENSE OF GRANDNESS IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER HOUSES, IT IS A BIT MORE BASED ON ACTUAL CREATIVITY AND GIVING LICENCE TO DESIGNERS TO REALLY EXPLORE THINGS. THE WAY THAT REMO [RUFFINI, MONCLER’S CEO] HAS COURTED AND PURSUED A CERTAIN STANDARD AND LEVEL OF DESIGNER IS REALLY ADMIRABLE. THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF A CLASH IN A WAY, WHICH I LIKE, BUT AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, I REALLY LIKE TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPRESS MY ETHOS TO DIFFERENT AUDIENCES. THE ETHOS OF BEING OPEN TO VARIATIONS OF AESTHETICS THAT GO BEYOND THE STANDARD ONES THAT WE’RE FORCED TO LOOK AT. THROUGH WORKING WITH MONCLER, I GET INTRODUCED TO A NEW AUDIENCE, WHO PERHAPS DOESN’T KNOW ME VERY WELL. IT ALLOWS ME TO TALK TO MORE PEOPLE. WHAT HAS THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THEM BEEN LIKE OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR COLLABORATIVE HISTORY WITH THEM? THEY’VE ALWAYS BEEN SO ENTHUSIASTIC IN ALLOWING ME TO DO WHAT I WANT TO. NO IDEA IS TOO OUTLANDISH. THIS COLLABORATION ON THE MAYA 70 IS A PRETTY SIMPLE ONE, THOUGH — IT’S NOT, LIKE, A COLLECTION. BUT WHAT I THINK THAT PEOPLE GET FROM THIS IS GOING, ‘OH, WELL, THAT’S A WEIRD MIX! RICK OWENS ISN’T REALLY THE KIND OF GUY WHO DOES THIS SORT OF THING’, AND THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO THINK OF BOTH OF US A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. FOR A BRAND LIKE MONCLER, IT SHOWS THAT THEY AREN’T RESTING ON THEIR LAURELS, AND THEY’RE ABLE TO EXTEND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESPECT TO A DESIGNER LIKE ME, THAT WOULDN’T NORMALLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. WHAT WE’VE DONE WITH THIS PARTICULAR JACKET ISN’T ANYTHING INCREDIBLY INTENSE. I’VE ADDED ARCHITECTURAL LINES OF MINE. IT’S THE PRODUCT OF MY LOOKING TOWARDS ITALIAN RATIONALIST ARCHITECTURE — ARCHITECTS LIKE LUIGI MORETTI, WHO I’VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF, AND GIO PONTI, OF COURSE — BUT IT’S REALLY JUST A VERY GENTLE, SUBTLE INTERVENTION. IF I GOT REALLY EXTREME WITH THIS, I’D PROBABLY BE WRITTEN OFF AS BEING TOO NICHE, BUT IF I’M ABLE TO SUBTLY INFILTRATE CONTEMPORARY CULTURE WITH WHAT I DO, THEN THOSE IDEAS CAN BE ACCEPTED. BEING TOO PROVOCATIVE AND CHALLENGING IS A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN I WANT TO BE IN MY LIFE. I WANT TO CHALLENGE, BUT IN KIND OF A CHEERFUL WAY. THEN AGAIN, WHAT I CONSIDER CHEERFUL, A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE CONSIDER AGGRESSIVE! FOR SURE, THERE’S A REAL SUBTLETY TO THIS, EVEN COMPARED TO YOUR PREVIOUS MONCLER COLLABORATIONS, LIKE WHAT YOU DID WITH THE TOUR BUS AS A CASE IN POINT. THEY DIDN’T BLINK AN EYE AT THAT. AND THAT WAS ABOUT MICHELE AND I GOING ON A ROAD TRIP IN OUR OWN PERSONAL AESTHETIC BUBBLE. WE WERE GOING TO AREA 51 IN NEVADA, AND TO MICHAEL HEIZER’S SECRET ART INSTALLATION — IT WAS KIND OF A GREAT PROJECT. THE BUS WAS BEAUTIFUL, AND THE COLLECTION WAS BEAUTIFUL, AND IT REALLY WAS ABOUT CREATING A SPECIAL LITTLE WORLD. THAT WAS A GREAT PROJECT. WE’VE ALREADY DISCUSSED HOW YOU PERSONALLY OVERCAME YOUR HESITANCY TO ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIONS… …AND MY DEEP SCORN FOR THEM! AND HERE, I AM — THE COLLAB KING! [LAUGHS] ON A BROADER NOTE, THOUGH, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR THEM SAYS ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IN FASHION? WHY DO YOU THINK THEY RESONATE SO WELL TODAY? I’M NOT REALLY SURE… I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT’S ABOUT UNITY, AND SEEING DISPARATE PERSONALITIES GRASP HANDS. THE CYNIC IN ME, HOWEVER, JUST THINKS IT’S GOSSIP — WE ALL LIKE TO SEE WHO’S HOOKING UP WITH WHO. BUT I’M NOT PUTTING GOSSIP DOWN. I LOVE GOSSIP! AND ARE COLLABORATIONS STUNTS? YEAH! BUT AT THE POINT WHERE I AM NOW IN MY LIFE, THEY’RE STUNTS THAT ARE A LOT OF FUN. THEY SHAKE UP MY PERSONAL RHYTHM, BRING ME INTO CONTACT WITH NEW PEOPLE AND MAKE ME ENGAGE IN A WAY THAT I DIDN’T BEFORE.

IN A FASHION INDUSTRY DOMINATED BY LARGE CONGLOMERATES SUCH AS LVMH AND KERING, RICK OWENS STILL OWNS RICK OWENS. 80 PERCENT OF OWENSCORP, AN INDEPENDENT INDUSTRY GIANT THAT GENERATES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ANNUALLY, BELONGS TO THE DESIGNER. HIS LABEL IS KNOWN FOR A DIALOGUE BETWEEN HIS UNIQUE EXPRESSION OF ELEGANCE AND BEAUTY AND WHAT HE CALLS A “RAGING EGO.” THE ENTRY-LEVEL PURCHASE TO BECOME PART OF HIS UNIVERSE MIGHT BE A BULKY SNEAKER. HOWEVER, IF YOU CARE TO LOOK FURTHER, THE LOYAL BRAND’S CUSTOMERS KEEP COMING BACK FOR ITS DELICATE, METICULOUSLY CONSTRUCTED CREATIONS. RICK OWENS MAKES YOU FEEL POWERFUL — NOT THROUGH SIMPLE LOGOS, BUT DESIGNS THAT EMPHASIZE THE IDEA OF UNDERSTATED LUXURY. IN OUR INTERVIEW, WE DECIDE TO FOCUS ON AN ERA BEFORE HE WAS KNOWN TO BE THE UNOFFICIAL LORD OF DARKNESS AND A RUMORED POST- APOCALYPTIC CULT LEADER: A GUY ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, EMERGING OUT OF PATTERNMAKING, TRYING TO GET BUYING APPOINTMENTS FOR HIS FASHION LABEL. BRENDA WEISCHER: IDEALLY, THIS INTERVIEW IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE STEREOTYPICAL HOLLYWOOD MOVIES ABOUT BECOMING SUCCESSFUL — MAINLY FOCUSING ON THE STRUGGLE. THE MOVIE ENDS WITH THE PROTAGONIST WALKING OUT ON STAGE, STANDING IN FRONT OF A GIANT CHEERING CROWD. THAT’S THE KIND OF SENTIMENT I WANT. COLLEGE DROPOUT, HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, CHARLES GALLAY, MAXFIELD, THE KATE MOSS LEATHER JACKET. MAYBE WE END IT WITH YOUR 2002 SHOW. RICK OWENS: FIRST I WENT TO ART SCHOOL, BUT THEN I COULDN&#39;T REALLY AFFORD THAT. I JUST LACKED THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA TO BE A SERIOUS ARTIST, AND I WAS INTIMIDATED BY THE THEORY CLASSES, WHICH WERE SUCH THEORETICAL BULLSHIT. SO I DROPPED OUT AND GOT A JOB. I WAS AN OFFICE ASSISTANT FOR AN ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSTRATION FIRM. IT WAS A VERY CHIC ENVIRONMENT FOR A YOUNG GUY LIKE ME. I DID THAT FOR A WHILE TO SURVIVE AND SUPPORT MYSELF. MEANWHILE, I WENT TO TRADE SCHOOL TO LEARN PATTERNMAKING, WHICH CAME TO ME QUITE NATURALLY. THEN I GOT A JOB AT A MANUFACTURER THAT DID KNOCK-OFFS. THEY WOULD BRING ME IN A CLAUDE MONTANA T-SHIRT OR A VERSACE JACKET, AND I WOULD COPY THE PATTERN FOR THEM. I DID THAT FOR A FEW YEARS UNTIL I GOT INTRODUCED TO MICHÉLE [LAMY] AND WAS OFFERED A JOB AS A PATTERNMAKER AT HER COMPANY. BW: IS IT TRUE THAT YOU GOT INTRODUCED TO MICHÉLE BY YOUR THEN-BOYFRIEND? DID YOU ALREADY DESIGN THERE OR JUST DID PATTERNMAKING? RO: I THINK I CONDENSED THIS STORY FOR INTERVIEWS. I DON’T ACTUALLY REMEMBER US REALLY BEING BOYFRIENDS, RATHER BEST FRIENDS WHO FUCKED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. MICHÉLE HAD ASKED RICK CASTRO, MY “BOYFRIEND,” TO DESIGN A MENSWEAR COLLECTION FOR HER, AND HE BROUGHT ME ON AS HIS PATTERNMAKER. RICK ACTUALLY CO-DIRECTED THE FILM HUSTLER WHITE BY BRUCE LABRUCE. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE IT’S A REAL SLICE OF OUR LIVES AT THAT MOMENT. MANY OF OUR FRIENDS ARE IN IT. BUT AT SOME POINT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF FRICTION, AND I GOT RICK FIRED BECAUSE I COULDN’T STAND HIM ANYMORE. WE DIDN’T TALK FOR TEN YEARS. HE BECAME A FETISH PHOTOGRAPHER AND HAD A GALLERY. EIGHT YEARS AGO I ASKED HIM TO DO A LOOKBOOK FOR ONE OF MY MEN’S COLLECTIONS, AND HE DID THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE. IT WAS ALL OLD GUYS, INCLUDING HIS FATHER — HE GOT HIS TOTALLY HOMOPHOBIC FATHER TO BE PART OF IT. ANYWAY, I THINK AFTERWARDS WE ALL REALIZED THAT EVERYONE ENDED UP WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. BW: SO AT THIS POINT YOU’RE THE MENSWEAR DESIGNER AT LAMY, MICHÉLE’S BRAND. RO: YES, BUT IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE THING TO DO, AND I SLIPPED INTO DOING WOMEN’S, WHICH WAS THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF THE BUSINESS. BUT THEN MICHÉLE HIT A FINANCIAL PLATEAU — TO GROW BIGGER SHE WOULD HAVE TO START PRODUCING OUTSIDE OF L.A. IT BECAME TEDIOUS AND WASN’T FUN FOR HER ANYMORE — IN TERMS OF PRICE AND COMPETITIVENESS. SHE STARTED WANDERING AWAY FROM IT, AND HER HUSBAND TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS. HE WASN’T SO INTO IT THOUGH AND LET IT GO AFTER A WHILE. MICHÉLE FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON HER RESTAURANT, AND I STARTED MY OWN LABEL AROUND THAT TIME. BW: IT WAS YOUR FIRST TIME TO DO SOMETHING UNDER YOUR OWN NAME, RIGHT? HOW DID YOU GET THE DESIGNS INTO STORES? I WANT TO KNOW THE MAXFIELD AND CHARLES GALLAY STORIES. RO: I WENT TO MAXFIELD FIRST BUT COULDN&#39;T GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH ANYBODY. THEN I WENT TO CHARLES GALLAY. BW: WITH AN APPOINTMENT? RO: NO, COLD CALL. I JUST WALKED IN, WITH MY STUFF IN DUFFEL BAGS, WALKED UP TO THE MANAGER AND SAID, “HEY, I HAVE THIS STUFF. DO YOU THINK I COULD SELL IT HERE?” I DON’T REMEMBER IF I HAD THAT MANY CLOTHES, BUT I SHOWED SOME BELTS, AND SHE SAID, “LET ME CALL CHARLES.” THE BELTS WERE COMPLEX CORSETS, VERY SHAPED, A LOT OF LACE UP, AND SOME RIBBON. I HAD ONE IN LEATHER AND ONE IN TULLE. I FOUND THE TULLE IN A HAT MAKING SUPPLY STORE IN DOWNTOWN L.A. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. BASED ON THESE BELTS, I GOT A REAL APPOINTMENT WITH CHARLES GALLAY. I TOOK MY DUFFEL BAG OF CLOTHES TO HIS WAREHOUSE SOMEWHERE IN CENTURY CITY. IT WAS A CONCRETE NONDESCRIPT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, AND WHEN I WALKED IN, THERE WERE ROWS OF RACKS WITH DESIGNERS INCLUDING ALAÏA AND VERSACE. IT WAS SO SOPHISTICATED. I SAID, “I’M BROKE. CAN YOU GIVE ME 50 PERCENT OF THE ORDER NOW?” AND THEY SAID YES. I THINK THAT WAS THE TIME WHERE FASHION BUYERS WERE ADVENTUROUS PIONEERS. THEY WENT AND SOUGHT FOR DESIGNERS IN GROTTOS; THEY WENT TO A FASHION SHOW IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. BW: HOW BIG WAS THIS FIRST ORDER? RO: OH, TINY OF COURSE. IT MUST’VE BEEN MAYBE 10000 DOLLARS, PROBABLY LESS. BW: DID YOU PRODUCE THE CLOTHES IN-HOUSE AND FINANCED IT WITH THE 50 PERCENT YOU GOT FROM THE SALES? RO: YEAH, THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES. THEN WE MOVED. MICHÉLE AND I GOT HELD UP AT GUNPOINT AT NIGHT, AND THE NEXT DAY WE WENT TO CHATEAU MARMONT. THAT’S WHERE WE LIVED FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS, AND IT’S WHERE I REALLY GOT ROLLING. BW: THAT SOUNDS EXPENSIVE. RO: IT WAS REDUCED RENT, BUT WE LEFT THE CHATEAU OWING THEM A LOT. WE ENDED UP HAVING TO PAY FOR A LONG TIME, ESPECIALLY FOR MY BAR BILL. THEN MICHÉLE OPENED LES DEUX CAFES, WHICH BECAME A VERY POPULAR NIGHTLIFE SPOT. I HAD MOVED MY STUDIO ACROSS THE STREET ON LAS PALMAS AVENUE. THE PLACE USED TO BE A STOCKROOM FOR A MAGAZINE STAND. IT WAS WONDERFUL THOUGH, SO WE MOVED INTO THAT TOGETHER AND BOTH KIND OF STARTED FROM ZERO. WE ATE AT THE RESTAURANT AND WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO MY STUDIO EVERY NIGHT. YOU HAD TO GO UP A LADDER TO OUR MATTRESS, AND WE WENT TO THE GYM FOR SHOWERS. GRADUALLY, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE SPACES NEXT TO MY PLACE AND COMBINED THEM. BUT IT WAS IN A REALLY DANGEROUS NEIGHBOURHOOD. WE WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND HAD TO DRAG CREAKING IRON GATES IN FRONT OF THE WINDOWS AT NIGHT TO LOCK OURSELVES IN. IT WAS SINISTER, GLAMOROUS, SLEAZY, AND GRITTY, AND IT WAS PRETTY GREAT. BW: I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF YOUNG DESIGNERS CAN RELATE TO: THE STRUGGLE OF LIVING IN SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY TO YOUR WORK. YOU WAKE UP AND STARE AT THE FAILURE OR SUCCESS OF WHATEVER YOU’RE WORKING ON AT THE MOMENT. RO: IT’S STILL VERY MUCH THE SAME FOR ME. WE LIVE ON THE TWO TOP FLOORS OF THIS HOUSE, AND THE REST IS OFFICE. I WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO LIVE WITH MY WORK; IT&#39;S ESSENTIAL TO ME. BUT AT THAT TIME, THE STUDIO BECAME A STORE ALMOST, BECAUSE I HAD RACKS OF EXTRA CLOTHES, AND PEOPLE WOULD COME OVER AND PICK STUFF UP. IT WASN’T SOMETHING I ENCOURAGED THOUGH. WATCHING PEOPLE TRY THINGS ON BORED ME TO TEARS. MICHÉLE REMINDED ME RECENTLY THAT SYDNEY TOLEDANO HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO LOOK AT MY RACKS, AND WE ENDED UP GOING TO THE BEACH THAT DAY BECAUSE I FORGOT. ANOTHER DAY A WOMAN FROM VANITY FAIR CAME BY, AND I DIDN’T HAVE ANY STOCK TO SHOW BESIDES ONE CORSET. THAT’S HOW IT WENT FOR A FEW YEARS. THEN I WENT TO EUROPE WITH CHARLES GALLAY, AND HE INTRODUCED ME TO OTHER STORES INCLUDING HENRI BENDEL, JOYCE FROM HONGKONG, LINDER DRESNER FROM CHICAGO. BW: WHAT WAS HIS BENEFIT AS A STOCKIST TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OTHER STORES? DIDN&#39;T HE WANT TO SELL YOU EXCLUSIVELY? RO: HE WANTED ME TO SURVIVE, AND I COULDN’T SURVIVE JUST ON HIM. HE WANTED SOMEONE HE WAS PROMOTING IN THE RIGHT STORE, SO THAT HE WOULD EVENTUALLY SELL MORE. I STARTED SELLING TO HENRI BENDEL IN NEW YORK, WHICH BECAME MY MAIN NEW YORK STORE. SOMEHOW ANDRÉ LEON TALLEY SAW MY STUFF IN STORE WINDOWS, FOUND OUT MY NUMBER, AND CALLED ME OUT OF THE BLUE, “I AM CALLING FROM VOGUE AND YOU MUST MEET ANNA.” I TOLD HIM I WOULD BE THERE NEXT MONTH, AS I PERIODICALLY WENT TO NEW YORK TO MEET BUYERS IN A HOTEL ROOM. BW: SPEAKING OF SELLING, THERE IS NO SALES AGENCY OR SALES TEAM AT THIS POINT, RIGHT? RO: NO. THERE WERE ONLY THREE PEOPLE: ME, DAFNE, WHO NEVER GOT PAID, AND RICARDO. HE HAD BEEN MY SAMPLEMAKER WHEN I WORKED AT THE KNOCKOFF PLACE. WHEN I MOVED OVER TO MICHELLE, HE MOVED WITH ME, AND HE ALSO CAME WITH ME WHEN I MOVED TO MY STUDIO. HE WAS MEXICAN, DIDN’T SPEAK MUCH ENGLISH, AND WAS VERY GRUFF. AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE HE WOULDN’T SHOW UP TO WORK BECAUSE HE WAS IN JAIL BECAUSE HE DRANK TOO MUCH AND STARTED A FIGHT OR SOMETHING. WHEN HE WASN’T WORKING FOR ME HE WAS DOING CONSTRUCTION. HE WAS SO DEVOTED AND TALENTED. HE SEWED EVERYTHING I MADE, AND I PAID HIM IN CASH. TO THIS DAY, I THINK HIS CRAFTSMANSHIP AND CAPABILITIES SHAPED MY DESIGN IDENTITY. HE HELPED ME ESTABLISH MY GARMENT CONSTRUCTION LANGUAGE. HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT BUILDING SOME KIND OF HUT IN MEXICO TO RETIRE. WE LOST TRACK OF HIM, BUT IT WAS ALWAYS HIS PLAN TO BE OFF-THE-GRID. BW: I’M SURE HE GOOGLED YOU EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND WAITED FOR HIS MENTION. RO: I HAVE LOOKED FOR HIM, AND I HAVE MENTIONED HIM. BECAUSE I FELT LIKE HE DESERVED TO BE RECOGNIZED. WE’VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIM. HE MUST BE IN HIS 80S NOW, SO I HOPE HE’S GOOD. BW: WOW, I DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT THIS. I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON THE FAIRYTALE-ESQUE STORY THAT’S OFTEN MENTIONED WHEN TALKING ABOUT RO’S HISTORY: ANNA WINTOUR STARTED SUPPORTING YOU BECAUSE SHE SAW ONE OF YOUR JACKETS ON KATE MOSS IN FRENCH VOGUE? RO: IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT, BUT IT REALLY STARTED WITH ANDRÉ LEON TALLEY CALLING ME. I MET ANNA IN PARIS IN A HOTEL ROOM FULL OF FLOWERS, BECAUSE ALL THE BRANDS SEND HER FLOWERS. I CAME WITH MY DUFFEL BAG, DUMPED EVERYTHING ON THE FLOOR, AND DAFNE TRIED THINGS ON. THEN WE LEFT. IT ALL HAPPENED AROUND THE SAME TIME: THE FRENCH VOGUE PICTURE BY CORINNE DAY, BENDEL, ANNIE LEIBOVITZ’S PICTURE IN AMERICAN VOGUE, MY FIRST RUNWAY SHOW IN NEW YORK, AND THE CFDA AWARD. THINGS HAPPENED QUITE NATURALLY FOR ME IN THE END, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A SLOW START. THROUGH A MUTUAL FRIEND I MET CARINE ROITFELD. ONE TIME WE HUNG OUT AT THE BEACH BECAUSE SHE WAS SHOOTING IN SANTA MONICA WITH MARIO TESTINO. YEARS LATER CARINE GOES, “I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE A DESIGNER. WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY ANYTHING?” I JUST SAID, “I DON&#39;T WANT TO BE A DOUCHE”. I THINK HOW MY JACKET ENDED UP IN FRENCH VOGUE SHOT BY CORINNE DAY WAS THROUGH THE STYLIST PANOS YIAPANIS, BECAUSE HE STARTED BORROWING MY CLOTHES FROM HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. I DON’T KNOW HOW HE FOUND ME; I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ARTICLE IN DUTCH MAGAZINE. THERE WAS A LITTLE BLURB ABOUT ME WITH A PICTURE OF GODDESS BUNNY IN MY CLOTHES. BUNNY WAS A BEAUTIFUL TRANS PERSON, WHO HAD MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR. SHE WAS A FIXTURE IN THE LA UNDERGROUND SCENE AND WOULD GET OUT OF HER WHEELCHAIR AND TAP DANCE. ANYWAYS, PANOS IS THE ONE WHO PUT KATE MOSS IN THAT LEATHER JACKET IN FRENCH VOGUE. LATER ON, WHEN CORINNE DIED, SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS BURIED IN THAT JACKET. BW: WITH THIS GROWING ATTENTION AROUND YOUR NAME, YOU WERE IN NEED OF ACTUAL SALES PEOPLE. HOW DID YOU MEET ELSA LANZO, CEO OF RICK OWENS, AND LUCA RUGGERI, OWENSCORP COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR? RO: ELSA AND LUCA CAME TO HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD TO FIND ME. BW: WAS THAT BEFORE THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK SHOW? RO: YEAH. THEY SAW ME IN THE MARIA LUISA STORE IN PARIS. ELSA AND LUCA WERE SALES AGENTS AND SOLD ALEXANDER MCQUEEN, OLIVIER THEYSKENS, AND ANN DEMEULEMEESTER TO MARIA LUISA. LUCA CAME TO ME AND SAID, “IF YOU SIGN A GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION DEAL WITH US, WE CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MANUFACTURERS AND ORGANIZE LICENSING.” I IMMEDIATELY SAID YES BECAUSE I WAS DESPERATE. THINGS WERE HAPPENING FOR ME BUT I WAS STILL BROKE. MICHÉLE AND I, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A GREAT LIFE, WERE SURVIVING ON DINNER AT THE CAFE EVERY NIGHT. I COULD BARELY PAY RENT AND WAS ALWAYS BEHIND. SO I SAID YES TO LUCA, BUT THEN HE DIDN’T CALL ME FOR THE LONGEST TIME, AND I SIGNED WITH TOTEM PARIS. THEY CARRIED RAF SIMONS, WHICH WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. I WAS HAPPY. BUT WHEN THE SHOWROOMS STARTED, IT WAS A BUNCH OF DESIGNERS ALL IN ONE ROOM. YOU COULDN’T TELL WHO’S WHO, AND I DIDN’T SELL ANYTHING FOR TWO SEASONS. I SOLD TO MY REGULAR CLIENTS BUT NOW HAD TO PAY COMMISSION ON TOP. MONTHS PASS, LUCA CALLS ME, AND GOES, “WE’RE READY TO SIGN.” I SAID, “YOU FUCKING TOOK TOO LONG!” THEY HAD TO BUY ME OUT. THAT’S HOW I STARTED WITH LUCA AND ELSA. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT I WENT TO A RAF SIMONS SHOW YEARS LATER, AND THEY WOULDN’T LET ME IN AT THE DOOR. AS I WALKED AWAY SLIGHTLY CONFUSED WITH MY INVITE IN HAND, THE RAF PR CAUGHT ME AND BROUGHT ME IN. LATER ON I HEARD THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SOMEONE FROM TOTEM DIDN’T WANT ME THERE. ANYWAYS, ELSA AND LUCA DROVE ME AROUND ITALY TO VIEW DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS WHO ALL SAID NO TO US. FINALLY, WE FOUND ONE MANUFACTURER IN CONCORDIA. THE MAN DIDN’T REALLY WANT ME, BUT THE WIFE THOUGHT I WAS INTERESTING. SO THEY TOOK ME ON. BW: DID YOU PRODUCE THE COLLECTION FOR YOUR FIRST SHOW IN ITALY? RO: YES, THAT FIRST ITALIAN-MADE COLLECTION WAS WHAT WE SHOWED IN THE FIRST SHOW IN NEW YORK. THE MUSIC FOR THAT SHOW WAS SO GOOD. IT STARTED WITH IGGY POP, ALICE COOPER’S “SICK THINGS,” WHICH IS SUCH AN ANTHEM FOR ME, AND ALIEN SEX FIEND “SMELLS LIKE SHIT.” IT WAS HILARIOUS THAT ALL THE EDITORS WERE SITTING THROUGH THAT. BW: I HAVE BEEN BEGGING YOUR TEAM TO MAKE A SHOW PLAYLISTS SINCE LAST YEAR, AND WHILE YOUR SHOWS HAVE MOVED TO PARIS, YOU STILL WORK WITH THE SAME FACTORY IN CONCORDIA, WHERE YOUR FIRST RUNWAY COLLECTION WAS PRODUCED AS WELL AS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WHO DROVE YOU AROUND ITALY TRYING TO FIND A FACTORY. RO: I AM STILL IN CONCORDIA DECADES LATER AND WORK WITH THE SAME PEOPLE. WE BOUGHT THE FACTORY FROM THEM. BW: YOU’RE LIKE HERMÈS WHO OWN THEIR OWN ALLIGATOR FARMS. RO: ACTUALLY, THEY HAVE PIG FARMS IN CONCORDIA. THAT’S WHAT SUPPORTED THEIR FACTORY FOR A WHILE. WE ALWAYS USED TO JOKE THAT WE WERE BEING FUNDED BY PROSCIUTTO.

BUT WITH ALL OF THAT GREATNESS COMES INEVITABLE POLARISATION. SO WHETHER YOU’RE WELL-VERSED IN OWENS’ UNORTHODOX DESIGNS OR A STRANGER TO HIS REPERTOIRE OF GENDERLESS CREATIONS, HARROLDS IS HERE TO UNEARTH THE MOTIVATIONS AND INNER-WORKINGS OF THE MASTERMIND HIMSELF. ORIGINALLY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, OWENS’ GLAMOROUS TAKE ON GOTHICISM IS WHAT EARNED HIM CULT SARTORIAL STATUS, MAKING ABSTRACT FASHION WEARABLE BY THE EVERYMAN. NOW, THE BONA FIDE PARISIAN IS SURROUNDED BY AUSTRALIANS IN HIS OFFICE, SPENDS HIS SPARE TIME SOAKING UP INSPIRATION AT THE LOUVRE, AND HAS TRIUMPHANTLY BROKEN FREE FROM THE SHACKLES OF SUFFOCATING ‘SMALL TOWN CONSERVATISM’. AS YOU READ ON, YOU’LL NOTE SOMEWHAT CRYPTIC, DEEPLY ASTUTE REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC HISTORIC MOVEMENTS AND BLACK AND WHITE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES. THE LATTER WAS IN FACT THE GUIDING INFLUENCE BEHIND HIS DESIGN CONCEPTS, SUMMONING THE GRIT OF THE GRUNGY END OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD WHERE HE STARTED HIS LABEL IN THE EARLY NINETIES AFTER DROPPING OUT OF ART SCHOOL. IN PERHAPS ONE OF OUR MOST BEWILDERING AND GRIPPING INTERVIEWS YET, WE WARMLY WELCOME THE POWERFUL AND POETIC FASHION FORCE THAT IS RICK OWENS. JARRINGLY INTELLECTUAL AND BREATHLESS IN HIS PROSE, OWENS’ RESPONSES WILL REVEAL THE RATIONALE BEHIND HIS WORKS, OR THEY MIGHT JUST MAKE YOU TILT YOUR HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND RELEASE A DUMBFOUNDED CHUCKLE. EITHER WAY, WE THINK THAT’S THE BEAUTY OF HIM. RICK, HELLO. CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A RUN-DOWN OF YOUR LAST WEEK IN WORK AND LIFE? WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO AND WHERE ARE YOU IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW? I AM ENJOYING MY QUIET LITTLE CORNER OF PARIS, EATING ICE CREAM AT NEW CAFÉS, DOING A LOT OF GYM, AND GOING TO MY FAVOURITE CHURCH AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE, THE BASILIQUE SAINTE-CLOTILDE. IT HAS BEAUTIFUL GREY-STONE SOARING VAULTED CEILINGS AND I LIKE TREATING IT LIKE IT’S AN EXTENSION OF MY HOUSE. AS TRITE AS IT SOUNDS, WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS OR RESOLUTIONS FOR 2023? I PLAN ON BEING MORE FEROCIOUSLY FOCUSED AND ABSOLUTELY RUTHLESS WITH MYSELF, EDITING MY AESTHETIC WITH MANIC PRECISE INTENSITY. AND BECAUSE WE’RE INCREDIBLY NOSY, WHAT EXACTLY DOES YOUR NOTORIOUSLY ORGANISED MORNING ROUTINE ENTAIL? WELL, THESE DAYS I’M WATCHING THE WINGS OF THE DOVE WITH CHARLOTTE RAMPLING IN FULL ‘KLIMT GLAMOURBITCH’ MODE AND PAUL POIRET COATS IN VENETIAN GONDOLAS — ALL WITH THE SOUND OFF AND JULIE LONDON SINGING “THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY” AS I SHOWER IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BEDROOM IN A CLOUD OF JAPANESE INCENSE AND LONGIFLORUM LILY FUMES. THEN I GO HAVE SOME BUTTERED TOAST ON THE TERRACE IN THE CHILLY MORNING AIR AND FEED THE CRUMBS TO THE BIRDS UNDER THE TREES BEFORE GOING TO MY CONCRETE OFFICE ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF MY HOUSE TO WORK ON PRE-COLLECTIONS. HARROLDS IS A PROUD STOCKIST OF RICK OWENS IN AUSTRALIA. WHAT DOES THIS PARTNERSHIP MEAN TO YOU? SURPRISINGLY, I HAVE THREE AUSTRALIANS IN MY PARIS OFFICE. THERE’S LUKE, A WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHER WHO HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 10 YEARS, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF IMAGERY AND HAS HAD TWO BABIES DURING OUR TIME TOGETHER. THEN THERE’S SARAH, WHO HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR SIX YEARS AND DOES RENDERINGS AND HELPS ORGANISE ALL THE COLLECTIONS. AND, OF COURSE, TYRONE, WHO HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR FIVE YEARS AS A MAJOR PART OF OUR DESIGN TEAM AND IS ALWAYS LOOK NUMBER ONE IN THE MEN’S SHOWS. LONG PLANE TRIPS ARE NOT MY FAVOURITE THING, BUT I’M SURE I’LL VISIT YOU AT SOME POINT. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE BEGINNINGS OF YOUR MONOLITHIC EPONYMOUS BRAND? HOW DID YOU GET AN IDEA OFF THE GROUND BACK IN 1994? WHO TOOK A CHANCE ON YOU? I JUST THOUGHT I WANTED TO EXPRESS MYSELF AS AUTHENTICALLY AS POSSIBLE AND SETTLED INTO BEING AN ECCENTRIC, LIVING IN POETIC SQUALOR PURSUING MY CRAFT. BUT I DID SUSPECT THAT I MIGHT ATTRACT SOMEONE WHO MIGHT LIKE TO HELP ME, AND LOW AND BEHOLD, I DID. THE ITALIAN PARTNERS THAT APPROACHED ME ARE STILL MY PARTNERS TO THIS DAY, AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE MORE TALENT AT PROTECTING AND NURTURING OUR LABEL THAN I DO. WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN ANDROGYNOUS DESIGN? WHO DO YOU INTEND OR ENVISAGE TO WEAR YOUR CLOTHING? I ALWAYS LOVED THE ANDROGYNY IN THE WORK OF EGON SCHIELE AND GUSTAVE MOREAU AND BOWIE AND JURGEN KLAUKE AND PIERRE MOLINIER. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME AND WILL ALWAYS HAVE A FOLLOWING. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR PREOCCUPATION WITH A GOTHIC AND LUXE-GRUNGE AESTHETIC FIRST EMERGED? CAN YOU DATE THIS BACK TO A PARTICULAR PERSON, PLACE, INFLUENCE OR TIME IN YOUR LIFE? I THINK THE IMAGERY IN BOOKS ABOUT BLACK-AND-WHITE SILENT CECILE B. DEMILLE BIBLE MOVIES IN MY DAD’S BASEMENT LIBRARY LED ME TO JUGENDSTIL AND THE VIENNESE SECESSION AND THE FRENCH SYMBOLISTS. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SUBCULTURE IN THE WORLD WITH A TASTE FOR MOODY EXOTICISM. HOW HAS YOUR BACKGROUND AND/OR UPBRINGING SHAPED THE DESIGNER (AND INDIVIDUAL) YOU ARE TODAY? I WAS RAISED IN A STRIDENTLY BIGOTED AND JUDGEMENTAL ENVIRONMENT THAT MADE ME WANT TO PROVIDE A HAVEN FOR SOFTER, SENSITIVE NON-CONFORMISTS. THE WORLD OF FASHION CAN BE JUST AS BRUTAL AS SMALL TOWN CONSERVATISM AND I WANT TO BE THE GUY THAT PROVIDES OTHER OPTIONS. IF YOU COULD STYLE ANYONE (DEAD OR ALIVE) WHO WOULD IT BE, AND WHY? MYSELF IN MY TWENTIES. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUN TO HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES AND CRAFT I HAVE NOW TO HAVE REVELLED IN THEM IN MY FLAMBOYANT DAYS. SINCE RELOCATING TO PARIS, YOU MUST KNOW A LOT OF THE BEST SPOTS TO SHOP, APPRECIATE ART AND INDULGE IN GOOD FOOD. CAN YOU GIVE US A FEW MUST-VISIT SPOTS FOR A FASHION SAVANT’S WEEKEND IN PARIS? FROM MY HOUSE, I CAN WALK THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES AND ARRIVE AT THE LOUVRE WHERE I HAVE A PASS THAT ALLOWS ME TO SLIP INTO A SIDE DOOR AND HAVE A QUICK FIX OF THE BEST OF WHAT THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER. AND I LOVE TO LUNCH IN THE OUTDOOR COLONNADE OF CAFÉ MARLEY THAT OVERLOOKS THE LOUVRE’S COURTYARD. WALKING BACK, I CAN STOP FOR A COFFEE AT THE DUCK POND AND GO HOME AND TAKE A NAP. IN YOUR DOWNTIME (IF THERE IS ANY), WHAT CAN WE FIND YOU GENUINELY RELISHING IN? READING BIOGRAPHIES AT THE SEASIDE KEEPS ME FED AND INSPIRED. THE BIOS OF PICASSO BY JOHN RICHARDSON, THE GARDENING BOOKS OF BEVERLY NICHOLS AND E.F. BENSON MAPP AND LUCIA SERIES ARE MY FAVOURITES. LASTLY, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO ANY YOUNG, BUDDING OR EMERGING DESIGNERS HOPING TO MAKE AN IMPACT IN A HEAVILY SATURATED FASHION LANDSCAPE? CREATE, CREATE, CREATE AND EDIT, EDIT, EDIT AND YOUR VOICE WILL EMERGE FOR BETTER OR WORSE. POST, AND FIND WAYS TO SHOW IT OFF AND YOU WILL FIND YOUR AUDIENCE AND LIVE AND BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. DON’T WORRY ABOUT BEING BIG, JUST GOOD.

WHETHER FOR BETTER OR WORSE, COLLABORATIONS THAT BRING TOGETHER PLAYERS FROM DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED ENDS OF THE LUXURY SPECTRUM RULE OVER THE WORLD OF FASHION WITH AN IRON FIST. FOR SOME, STAMPING PRODUCTS WITH UNLIKELY LOGOS AND BRANDINGS THAT ONCE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE (APPARENTLY, WE ALL LONG FOR A CO-BRANDED DHL PHONE CASE) IS A VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL, WHILE FOR OTHERS IT CAN SEEM LIKE A FORLORN ATTEMPT TO REVIVE PAST GLORIES. BUT WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT AUTHENTICITY? WE’LL LET FASHION DESIGNER RICK OWENS, WHO OWNS 80 PERCENT OF OWENSCORP AND HAS NO NEED TO SUBMIT TO THE WILES OF CORPORATE SHARKS TO STAY AFLOAT, WEIGH IN ON THE SUBJECT. “IN THE WORST CASES, FASHION COLLABS ARE OBVIOUS HYPE MACHINES MADE TO ARTIFICIALLY STIMULATE SALES,” HE SAYS, “BUT IN THE BEST CASES, THEY CAN BE CREATIVE ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN GIANTS THAT PROMOTE COMPROMISE, FRIENDSHIP AND COMMUNITY. I’M FINE WITH SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE.” FOR HIS LATEST COLLABORATION WITH ITALIAN OUTERWEAR GIANT MONCLER, WHICH DEBUTED IN MARCH, OWENS IMAGINED A CHIMAERA OF “A NEW-AGE ISOLATION TANK AND AN EGYPTIAN TOMB”. A SARCOPHAGUS, IF YOU’LL ALLOW IT. AND WERE THOSE ANCIENT PHARAOHS TO WALK AMONG US, WHAT WOULD THOSE LOOK LIKE? ACCORDING TO FASHION’S LORD OF DARKNESS, IT WOULD BE A PRISM-SHAPED POD, COVERED IN MIRRORS, WITH GULL-WING DOORS ON THE SIDES, UPHOLSTERED WITH A VEGETAL-DYED AND RECYCLED NYLON DUVET AND EQUIPPED WITH CRYOGENIC OXYGEN CAPABILITIES. THE DESIGNER INDIRECTLY COMPARES THE FUTURISTIC SARCOPHAGUS TO SLEEPING BEAUTY’S GLASS COFFIN, CHRIST’S TOMB, ELLEN RIPLEY’S 57-YEAR SLEEPING POD AND MICHAEL JACKSON’S HYPERBARIC SLEEPING TANK – AFTER ALL, IT’S A SPACE TO “RETREAT, REPOSE AND REJUVENATE” IN. WOULD ANYONE CARE FOR AN AFTERNOON SNOOZE DURING BLINK-182’S PERFORMANCE AT COACHELLA? MONCLER AND OWENS HAD ALREADY MADE BOLD EXPERIMENTS TOGETHER, MOST MEMORABLY WITH A TOUR BUS IN 2020. THIS PECULIAR OBJECT – A PHANTASMAGORICAL CHAMBER SOME MIGHT CALL IT – TOOK OWENS AND HIS ETERNAL MUSE/WIFE/COLLABORATOR MICHÈLE LAMY ON A TRIP THROUGH THE NEVADA DESERT IN SEARCH OF THE MYSTERIOUS ARTWORKS OF MICHAEL HEIZER. BUT WHAT BEGAN AS A TOUR BUS GRADUALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING MORE, A VEHICLE THAT ACTED AS SHELTER FROM THE WORLD, A PROTECTIVE BUBBLE FROM ALL ITS TROUBLES. INDEED, IT MORPHED INTO A SLEEPING POD OF SORTS, AN ACCOMPLISHMENT PAR EXCELLENCE IN THE FEAT OF REDUCTIONISM. AND YES, FOR THE FASHION NOVICES OUT THERE, A SLEEPING CHAMBER ISN’T A FORAY TOO PREPOSTEROUS FOR FASHION’S DARK LORD: SINCE 2007 IN A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO PILLARS OF THE OWENSVERSE, HE’S BEEN MAKING FURNITURE TOGETHER WITH LAMY. “CLOTHES ARE A CONTINUING DIALOGUE WITH THE WORLD ON A SPECIFIC CYCLE THAT I LOVE – THE SPEED GIVES ME MOMENTUM AND A SENSE OF PURPOSE,” THE DESIGNER EXPLAINS. “BUT FURNITURE – AT LEAST THE FURNITURE I LIKE TO MAKE – IS SLOWER AND MORE MONUMENTAL. COMBINED, THEY’RE BOTH A WAY OF CONFIRMING YOUR VALUES TO YOURSELF BY COMMITTING TO THEM AS PHYSICALLY AS POSSIBLE.” TO ACCOMPANY HIS DROP WITH MONCLER, HE DESIGNED QUILTED TUNICS AND ROBES, AND SHORTS WITH LONG THICK SOCKS THAT “MELT INTO THE QUILTED INTERIOR AND EXTEND THE MEDITATIVE AND HEALING VIBE [OF THE CAPSULE]”. OWENS’ OEUVRE RUNS THE GAMUT OF EXTREMITIES. THE MATTE SEQUINS HE EMPLOYS IN HIS COLLECTIONS, WHICH HE CALLS “AN EXERCISE IN PERVERSITY”, ARE ANTITHETIC TO HIS MICROCOSM. “I STARTED WORKING WITH THEM BECAUSE THEIR VULGAR FLASH SEEMED SO ALIEN TO THE MUTED AND AUSTERE AESTHETIC I WAS PUSHING, AND I WAS READY FOR DISRUPTION,” HE EXPLAINS, “I FELT THIS LAST SEASON LIKE MERCILESSLY AND SHAMELESSLY TESTING EVERYONE’S BREAKING POINT AND COMPLETELY OVERDOING THEM.” BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE. DRESSES WITH NOSFERATU-ESQUE SHOULDERS FROM AUTUMN 2022 (BELOVED BY BILLY PORTER), AUTUMN 2023’S BUBBLE-PINK PUFFER COATS THAT WRAP AROUND MODELS LIKE THE TONGUES OF OTHERWORLDLY BEASTS, THE DAY BED OF PLYWOOD AND PETRIFIED WOOD, WHICH RESEMBLES A SLAB OF STONE, RUBBERY-LATEX WRAPAROUND PIECES FROM SPRING 2023 ALL REAP AWE. IN THE SAME VEIN OF FERVENT RE-INVENTION, SELF-INVENTION AND DISRUPTION, THE LORD OF DARKNESS STANDS TALL AS IF CAST FROM BRONZE, HIS JET-BLACK HAIR THE LENGTH OF CHER’S CIRCA 1970. JUST LIKE THE WAX FIGURE IN HIS PARIS BOUTIQUE AT GALERIE DE VALOIS, HE MIGHT WELL BE AT THE CENTRE OF HIS OWN ARTISTIC UNIVERSE. AT SOME POINT, WHEN STUDYING THE OWENSVERSE AND ITS RECURRING REBELLIONS AGAINST RIGID AESTHETIC RULES, BIGOTRY AND JUDGEMENT, YOU MIGHT WONDER WHAT THE BLUEPRINTS FOR SUCH A WORLD MIGHT LOOK LIKE. DO THEY EVEN EXIST? THERE WAS A VIDEO CIRCULATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA OF OWENS SAYING HE DOESN’T USE MOOD BOARDS. BUT, HE NOW SAYS, “THAT WAS A DUMB THING FOR ME TO SAY. WE ALL HAVE IMAGE BANKS WE REFER TO. I JUST KEEP MINE OUT OF VIEW SO THEIR INFLUENCE ON ME IS AS VAGUE AS POSSIBLE.” HE MENTIONS HIS COLLECTION OF SCREENSHOTS, WITH FOLDERS TITLED INHUMAN (IT CONTAINS PORTRAITS OF HEROES LIKE SALVADOR DALI, JOSEPH BEUYS AND KLAUS NOVI), SALON (IMAGES OF INTERIORS, FROM PIERRE CHAREAU TO ADOLPHE APPIA) AND BIBLE, WITH DEPICTIONS OF THE CREATIONS OF HIS THAT HE FINDS MOST SUCCESSFUL. MIGHT THE LATTER, ONE WONDERS, CONTAIN THE STROBE HELMET FROM HIS AUTUMN 2022 MENSWEAR COLLECTION OR THE MATTE-SEQUIN- EMBELLISHED PUFFER BOLERO FROM 2023? MARBLE TOMB CHAIRS TOPPED WITH ANTLERS? OR EVEN IMAGINED STILLS OR SKETCHES OF PHOTOGRAPHER MATT LAMBERT’S BUTT MUSCLE VIDEO, FEATURING AMERICAN DRAG ARTIST CHRISTEENE, ON WHICH THE DESIGNER AND LAMY COLLABORATED IN 2017 AND WHICH OWENS STILL RECALLS WITH FONDNESS? “THE WORLD CAN BE A VERY JUDGEMENTALLY CONDEMNING AND OVERLY MORALISTIC PLACE. I FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO COUNTERBALANCE THAT WITH LIGHT-HEARTED CHEERFUL DEPRAVITY,” HE SAYS. LUBED-UP CHRISTEENE, A LEVITATING LAMY IN A DRESS DESIGNED BY OWENS HIMSELF AND ABOUT A HALF-DOZEN DERRIÈRES SHOWED AU NATUREL MAY HAVE SEEMED CHIC AND ADORABLE TO SOME, BUT SODOM AND GOMORRAH-BLE TO THE SANCTIMONIOUS. TO OWENS, HOWEVER, SUCH VISUALS ARE WHAT COUNTERS THE SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS, ALLOWING FOR TENDER AND AUTHENTIC EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE. “IT WAS A VIDEO ABOUT EXPERIENCING LOVE THROUGH WHATEVER CHANNELS YOU HAVE TO,” HE SAYS, “AND WORKING ON IT FELT LIKE LAYERS OF VIBRATING AND RADIATING LOVE. IN A WORLD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, OWENS REMAINS HIS OWN MAN, STEADFAST AND INDEPENDENT. FERVENTLY AND DETERMEDLY, HE EMBARKS ON VENTURES THAT UPHOLD HIS CREATIVE VISION UNADULTERATED BY THE VOCIFEROUS OPINION OF VARIOUS BOARDS AND COMMITTEES. MAY THE LORD OF DARKNESS REIGN FOREVER.

AHEAD OF THE MEN&#39;S FASHION WEEK AT THE END OF JUNE, WE MET WITH THE LORD OF DARKNESS AT HIS HOME IN PARIS. MOVIES, EYEBROW SHAVING, TIKTOK, AND PENISES PROTRUDING FROM THEIR TUNICS. HE WEARS A THIN BLACK SWEATER AND BLACK SHORTS, REVEALING LEAN, MUSCULAR CALVES. HIS LONG, STRAIGHT BLACK HAIR FALLS TO HIS SHOULDERS. HIS HEAD IS ADORNED WITH A SMALL BLACK CAP. ON HIS FEET, HEAVY BLACK AND WHITE SHOES GIVE HIM A LUMBERING HEIGHT. RICK OWENS GREETS US WITH A SMILE AND AN OUTSTRETCHED HAND. HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF BEFORE GIVING US A TOUR OF THE PROPERTY. WE&#39;RE IN PARIS, AT THE FORMER HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY, THE BUILDING THAT HOUSES THE DESIGNER&#39;S LIVING AND WORKING QUARTERS. AT THE END OF THE ROUGH CONCRETE HALL, A TERRACE OVERLOOKS THE FORMER MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. ALL IS CALM AND MINIMAL. AN UNFINISHED WOODEN STAIRCASE LEADS UP TO THE ROOM WHERE HE WORKS ON HIS COLLECTIONS. A LONG TABLE SHOWCASES DRAWINGS ON THE WALL. WE SIT AT THE CORNER BENCH. BORN IN 1962 IN PORTERVILLE, A SMALL TOWN 260 KILOMETERS NORTH OF LOS ANGELES, RICK OWENS IS A MAJOR FIGURE IN FASHION AND, MORE BROADLY, THE ART WORLD. THE MAN THE MEDIA LIKES TO CALL THE LORD OF DARKNESS IS DISTURBING, SURPRISING, AND FASCINATING. AT HIS SHOWS, HORDES OF FANS POUR IN WITH EXTRAVAGANT, BLACK-TINTED FLAMBOYANCE. THE TWO MOST FAMOUS ARTISTS ARE FECAL MATTER, A YOUNG DUO WITH A &quot;GLAMOUR ALIEN&quot; LOOK, MINIMALLY MIXING SHAVED HEADS, WHITE MAKE-UP, DISTORTING LENSES, AND OVERSIZED PLATFORM SHOES. HIS COLLECTIONS DEPICT A MYSTICAL, FUTURISTIC WORLD WHERE THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN MASCULINE AND FEMININE ARE BLURRED. HIS MANNEQUINS ARE LIKE MAGICIANS FROM A BACKROOM OR ON A DESERT PLANET, PERHAPS LIKE EARTH WILL BECOME ONCE SCORCHED BY GLOBAL WARMING. AS A YOUNG ADULT, RICK OWENS ATTENDED OTIS, AN ART SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES THAT DISPLEASED HIM. TOO THEORETICAL... TOO ABSTRACT. AFTER TWO YEARS, HE WENT TO A FASHION DESIGN SCHOOL, MAKING PATTERNS FOR FAST-FASHION COMPANIES. AT THE SAME TIME, IN LOS ANGELES, COOL IS EMBODIED BY A CERTAIN MICHÈLE LAMY, A FORMER FRENCH LAWYER FROM NEW YORK, WHO OPENED TRACTION AVENUE, A BOUTIQUE IN BEVERLY HILLS, LE CAFÉ DES ARTISTES, A HIP RESTAURANT IN HOLLYWOOD, AND SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED LAMY, HER CLOTHING LINE. WITH HER HUSBAND AT THE TIME, FILM PRODUCER RICHARD NEWTON, SHE WAS A CELEBRITY IN THE LATE 1980S L.A. NIGHTLIFE. ONE DAY, RICK OWENS APPLIED FOR A JOB WITH LAMY. ONE NIGHT WHILE DRINKING AT A CLUB, HE FINALLY MANAGED TO TALK WITH HIS BOSS. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. HE SAID HE WAS 27 AT THE TIME, SO SHE WOULD BE 45. MICHÈLE LAMY BECAME HIS MUSE AND PARTNER. AS WELL AS HIS COACH, AND HELPED HIM OVERCOME THE PARALYZING APATHY CAUSED BY HIS HEAVY DRINKING. RICK OWENS SOON DEVELOPED A PASSION FOR THE GYM AND TOOK UP STEROIDS TO BUILD MUSCLE IN A BODY HE FOUND FLABBY. HE ORGANIZED HIS FIRST SHOW IN 1994, BUT IT WASN&#39;T UNTIL 2002 THAT HE MADE HIS MARK ON NEW YORK&#39;S FASHION WEEK. A YEAR LATER, THE LAMY-OWENS COUPLE MOVED TO PARIS, ESTABLISHING A FORM OF RADICALISM IN THE FASHION WORLD. A PERENNIAL RADICALISM: THE COLLECTIONS AND SCENOGRAPHY VARY, BUT THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE (GRANDIOSE AND MINIMAL, HEROIC, AND INSOLENT) REMAINS THE SAME. IN 2019, AS PART OF THE FIAC, THE CENTRE POMPIDOU IS GIVING HIM CARTE BLANCHE FOR THE NIGHT. BEFORE THE WORKS OF THE PERMANENT COLLECTION, PERFORMERS INCLUDE CHRISTEENE (BUTTS IN THE AIR), RAPPER TOMMY CASH, MUSICIAN GLEN MEADMORE (PENIS OUT), THE DIVINE DAVID, MOTHER RHEEDA LADURÉE, AND KEMBRA PFAHLER. JOLTING. TURBULENT. DISORDERLY. RICK OWENS QUESTIONS THE MUSEUM SPACE AND THE CONCEPT OF BEAUTY. CONFORMITY, GOOD TASTE, AND BOREDOM HAVE LONG BEEN BANISHED FROM THE VOCABULARY OF THE MAN WHO SEES HIS FASHION SHOWS AS PERFORMANCES. WE EXPECTED A RESERVED, ARROGANT, AND COLD PERSON. INSTEAD, RICK OWENS IS FUNNY, ENGAGING, AND TALKATIVE. IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO START THE INTERVIEW WITH THE QUESTION WE HAD PREPARED (&quot;WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING TODAY&quot;), HE DECIDED TO TELL US ABOUT THE FILM HE HAD JUST SEEN, PETER VON KANT BY FRANÇOIS OZON. HOW DID THIS MOVIE CHANGE YOU? RICK OWENS — IT’S IRRESISTIBLE. IT&#39;S AN ADAPTATION OF FASSBINDER&#39;S THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT. I&#39;M SURE I&#39;VE MISSED PLENTY OF SUBTLE REFERENCES, AS I HAVEN&#39;T SEEN ANY FASSBINDER IN YEARS. WITHOUT THEM, THE FILM IS A LITTLE CRAZY. ISABELLE ADJANI IS FASCINATING. HER CHARACTER IS CARTOONISH. EVERYTHING IS EXAGGERATED TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE. IT&#39;S ALMOST KABUKI. HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THE FILMS YOU WANT TO SEE? HMM... THIS ONE FOR EXAMPLE, HOW DID YOU CHOOSE IT? OH, BECAUSE IT&#39;S FASSBINDER AND ISABELLE ADJANI. I&#39;VE ALWAYS LOVED THE CINEMA: EISENSTEIN, FRITZ LANG, CRONENBERG...I WATCH AN OLD FILM EVERY MORNING. IN RECENT WEEKS, IT WAS THE BLACK CAT, A BLACK-AND-WHITE HORROR FILM FROM THE 1930S STARRING BORIS KARLOFF AND BELA LUGOSI. IT EMERGED AFTER THE PARIS INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF MODERN DECORATIVE AND INDUSTRIAL ARTS, WHERE ART DECO, MODERNISM, ETC. ENSHRINED. IN THIS FILM, AN ARCHITECT LIVES IN A VERY JEAN PROUVÉ STYLE HOUSE. IT WAS RADICAL FOR ITS TIME. IT&#39;S THE STORY OF A YOUNG COUPLE ON THEIR HONEYMOON WHO, AFTER AN ACCIDENT, END UP WITH A MAD SCIENTIST WHO KEEPS HIS FORMER LOVERS IN GLASS COFFINS IN THE BASEMENT. I WATCH IT WITHOUT SOUND AND PLAY OPERA. I LOVE IT FOR ITS BLACK AND WHITE, MODERNIST ARCHITECTURE, AND EXAGGERATED CHARACTERS. THERE&#39;S SOMETHING TOUCHING ABOUT THIS OLD MAN WHO LIVES WITH HIS PAST LOVES. I CAN SEE MYSELF IN HIM. I&#39;M AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL IN EVERYTHING I DO. SO, WHEN I WATCH THIS FILM, I THINK ABOUT WHO I AM AND WHERE I AM IN LIFE, AND THIS IDEA OF LIVING IN AUSTERE PRECISION, SUPPRESSING EMOTIONS HIDDEN IN THE BASEMENT. THE ADDED INTEREST IS THAT IT SHARES THE SAME SCRIPT AS THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, WHICH WAS VERY EDUCATIONAL FOR ME DURING A TIME WHEN I WAS TRYING TO BECOME AN ARTIST. I COME FROM A SMALL PROVINCIAL TOWN WITH A CLOSED, SANCTIMONIOUS MINDSET. WE HAD TO DRIVE TWO HOURS TO REACH A CITY WHERE A CINEMA WAS SHOWING IT AT MIDNIGHT. BECAUSE IN THE USA IN THE 1970S, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW WAS SHOWN AT MIDNIGHT, AND THE KIDS WOULD TURN UP IN DISGUISE. FOR ME, IT WAS A WAY OUT, THE ONLY WAY TO ENCOUNTER THIS FLAMBOYANT EXOTICISM, THIS FREEDOM. THIS FILM MADE ME WHO I AM TODAY. HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT IT? WHEN YOU&#39;RE YOUNG AND CURIOUS, YOU LOOK TO DISCOVER NEW THINGS FROM ROCK MAGAZINES LIKE YOURS. HOW DID THIS FILM CHANGE YOU? AT ONE OF MY SHOWS, I LOOKED AT THE AUDIENCE, ESPECIALLY THE KIDS. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF: &quot;BUT I RECREATED THE PARTY SCENE FROM THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.&quot; IT TOUCHED ME DEEPLY. THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR WHOM I REPRESENT A KIND OF FREEDOM. I&#39;M PROVING TO THEM THAT YOU CAN BE YOURSELF BY CELEBRATING YOUR ECCENTRICITY. IT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY, ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID AND SANCTIMONIOUS. CONSERVATIVE POLITICS DOMINATE THE WORLD TODAY; CONSERVATIVE VOICES HAVE IMMENSE POWER. IT&#39;S ALMOST A MORAL DUTY FOR ME TO PROPOSE A COUNTERVAILING POWER. I DON&#39;T WANT TO ELIMINATE MORALISM BECAUSE IT&#39;S PART OF OUR WORLD, BUT WE ALSO NEED DECADENCE. I&#39;M NOT ENTIRELY DEPRAVED! [LAUGHS] BUT I DO SUGGEST DEPRAVITY IN MY WORK. THE FORCES OF EVIL HAVE NEVER TOTALLY WON, OR WE WOULDN&#39;T BE HERE TODAY. HENCE, ALTHOUGH HUMAN NATURE CAN BE TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING, I TAKE COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT GOOD ALWAYS WINS, AS IT HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT HISTORY. SO THAT EXPLAINS THE FILM I WATCH IN THE MORNING! BUT FOR OTHER SAILORS, IT&#39;S CECIL B. DEMILLE&#39;S CLEOPATRA WITH CLAUDETTE COLBERT—A MIX OF EGYPT, HISTORY, 1940S HOLLYWOOD, BLACK AND WHITE, AND ART DECO. THERE ARE MANY WORTHWHILE LAYERS IN THIS FILM. YOU&#39;RE QUOTING OLD REFERENCES. ARE YOU ALSO INTERESTED IN CURRENT FILM PRODUCTION? MICHÈLE [LAMY] AND I WATCHED JANE BY CHARLOTTE. A DELICATE FILM. I FELL IN LOVE WITH CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG, WITH WHOM I WAS UNFAMILIAR. SO WE WATCHED ALL HER FILMS, INCLUDING THE ONES SHE MADE WITH LARS VON TRIER. IT WAS DURING THE WEEK OF CHRISTMAS! CURRENT FILMS... I DON&#39;T WATCH MANY. I DON&#39;T HAVE THE TIME. I FALL ASLEEP QUICKLY WHEN I GO TO BED. I LOVE TRASHY MOVIES AND SERIES, LIKE RYAN MURPHY&#39;S AMERICAN HORROR STORY. I HAVEN&#39;T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN A LONG TIME. IT BRINGS GAY FLAMBOYANCE TO THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. AND IT&#39;S NOT CONDESCENDING GAY FLAMBOYANCE A LA WILL &amp; GRACE, WHERE GAYS ARE JUST CARICATURES. IT&#39;S THE QUEER MENTALITY OF GOING BEYOND. IN PARTICULAR, THERE&#39;S ANGELA... WHAT&#39;S HER NAME AGAIN? YOU KNOW, THE BEAUTIFUL BLONDE ACTRESS WHO PLAYED IN KING KONG WAS SPOTTED BY ANTONIO LOPEZ IN THE SEVENTIES. JESSICA LANGE! YES, JESSICA FUCKING LANGE! SHE PLAYS A WOMAN WHO RUNS A CIRCUS AFTER HAVING HER LEGS AMPUTATED WHILE FILMING A SNUFF MOVIE IN BERLIN, WHERE SHE WAS A PORN ACTRESS. BRINGING THIS EXAGGERATION TO THE CONTEMPORARY TELEVISION LANDSCAPE... ASSUMING THAT VIEWERS ARE INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT, THAT&#39;S BRILLIANT. SOMETIMES RYAN MURPHY CAN BE A BIT CORNY... THE OTHER DAY, I SAW ON INSTAGRAM THAT JOHN WATERS WAS WEARING RICK OWENS SHOES! IT WAS THE THRILL OF A LIFETIME. HAVE YOU EVER MET? [HE SHAKES HIS HEAD NO] WE SHOULD HAVE ARRANGED A MEETING! HE&#39;S IN PARIS RIGHT NOW TO PROMOTE HIS BOOK. I DON&#39;T NEED TO MEET HIM. HE MIGHT NOT BE VERY NICE. AT LEAST THAT&#39;S WHAT I&#39;VE HEARD. I LOVE WHAT HE&#39;S DONE, AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE&#39;S WEARING MY SHOES. PINK FLAMINGOS IS MY LIFE. COMPLETE DECADENCE. IT WAS SUCH A THRILL FOR A KID LIKE ME. I THOUGHT, &quot;WOW, YOU CAN GO SO FAR AND CREATE SOMETHING PERSUASIVE.&quot; IT WAS A REAL LESSON. DO YOU THINK THIS TYPE OF ENERGY STILL EXISTS TODAY? HMM... YES. BUT THEY ARE CRUSHED. IT&#39;S HARD TO SEE. THERE&#39;S SO MUCH MEDIOCRE ENERGY OUT THERE COVERING IT UP. IT&#39;S HARD TO SEE GENUINE SINCERITY. ANYONE CAN HAVE A FLASH OF AUTHENTICITY. MAINTAINING IT IS A PROBLEM. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME READING BOOKS, WATCHING MOVIES, TEACHING MYSELF, LEARNING, AND STUDYING AGAIN AND AGAIN. THEN CAME THE MOMENT WHEN I COULD GET UP ON STAGE AND PERFORM. IT&#39;S A MATTER OF BRINGING TOGETHER EVERYTHING YOU&#39;VE ACCUMULATED OVER THE YEARS AND GIVING IT YOUR OWN VERSION, YOUR OWN REINTERPRETATION. DESIGNERS OFFER A COMPOSITION OF WHAT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED AND LEARNED OVER THE YEARS. SO, I STOPPED SEARCHING. I&#39;M SURE THERE ARE PROPOSALS AS STRONG AS BEFORE, BUT I NO LONGER HAVE THAT INSATIABLE DESIRE TO ABSORB. I&#39;M ALMOST SATURATED SO I CAN BE VERY SHARP. I ONLY REACT TO WHAT HITS ME RIGHT IN THE FACE. IT&#39;S A BIT UNHEALTHY TO SAY, &quot;OH I&#39;VE ALREADY SEEN TOO MUCH&quot;, BUT I&#39;M ALSO AWARE THAT THIS IS WHEN I EXPRESS MYSELF. I STILL HAVE A PLATFORM, AND I NEED TO PERFORM WHILE I STILL CAN. YOU NEVER KNOW HOW LONG IT&#39;S GOING TO LAST... I&#39;VE SEEN OLD STYLISTS REACH SATURATION POINT AND THEN STOP BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE NO LONGER RELEVANT, AND THAT ISN&#39;T VERY GOOD. I WONDER HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT. HUMAN NATURE ALWAYS WANTS MORE AND WANTS TO BE HEARD TOO. EVERYONE WANTS TO BE HEARD AND RECOGNIZED, WHETHER PROFESSIONALLY, BY THEIR LOVER OR THEIR CHILDREN. I&#39;VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO EXPERIENCE THIS TO AN UNIMAGINABLE EXTENT. HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU&#39;RE STILL RELEVANT TODAY? I&#39;M NOT SURE. NO, TRUTHFULLY, I&#39;M CERTAIN. I&#39;M MORE RELEVANT THAN I&#39;VE EVER BEEN. I&#39;VE HAD MUCH SUCCESS, SO EVEN IF I SCREW UP, I&#39;LL BE FINE, AND I&#39;LL BE ABLE TO MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE. AND I&#39;M STILL LEARNING, TECHNICALLY SPEAKING. FEW DESIGNERS CAN KEEP THEIR OWN VOICE AS LONG AS I HAVE. I&#39;M GOING TO BE A LEGEND! IT MAY SOUND ARROGANT TO SAY SO, [LAUGHS] BUT I WILL BECOME A LEGEND THROUGH SHEER TENACITY. AND IT&#39;S NOT JUST ABOUT ME AND MY TALENT. I WAS PROTECTED BY BUSINESS PARTNERS, WHO DIDN&#39;T REALLY INTERFERE WITH WHAT I WANTED TO DO. THEY SUPPORTED ME. LIKE SAINT LAURENT AND PIERRE BERGÉ. I&#39;M NOT COMPARING MYSELF, OF COURSE; I&#39;M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE DYNAMICS. I FEEL PROTECTED AND NURTURED. TALENT IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF SUCCESS. THERE&#39;S ALSO WISDOM, PLANNING, NOT SATURATING THE MARKET, AND DELIVERING QUALITY GARMENTS ON TIME SO THAT THEY CAN BE SOLD AT HIGH PRICES BY THE SALES FORCE. IT&#39;S A TESTAMENT TO THE POWER OF BUSINESS RATHER THAN THE POWER OF TALENT. DO YOU STILL FEEL FREE? OR IS IT SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO CREATE TO PLEASE BUYERS? I&#39;M NOT UNAWARE... I&#39;M PRACTICAL. I DON&#39;T DESIGN COSTUMES. MY CLOTHES CAN BE VERY THEATRICAL, BUT FOR EVERY DRAMATIC PLAY, THERE ARE TONS OF PIECES THAT CAN FIT INTO ANYONE&#39;S WORLD. I LIKE THINGS BASIC, SIMPLE, AND EVEN COMMERCIAL BUT WELL-CONSIDERED. I SEEK TO CORRUPT THE WORLD IN SMALL WAYS. IT&#39;S WONDERFUL TO PRODUCE MY CLOTHES AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. PART OF ME HAS LONG BEEN EMBARRASSED BY THIS VERY MASCULINE SIDE OF &quot;I&#39;M GOING TO SPILL MY SPERM ALL OVER THE WORLD.&quot; IT&#39;S AN EGO TRIP, BUT ALSO A VERY HUMAN NEED TO BE HEARD, TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS. I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE WORLD. I SAY THINGS, AND IT ANSWERS. IT&#39;S PROOF THAT PEOPLE NEEDED TO HEAR IT. YOU TALK ABOUT SPERM. YOUR PIECES GIVE OFF A VERY SEXUAL VIBE. WHERE DO THESE IMAGES COME FROM? FROM SEX-CLUBS? PORN? I LOVE PORN! I LOVE OLD AND NEW PORN. BUT I DON&#39;T THINK MY WORK IS PARTICULARLY EROTIC. I SEE IT MORE AS ACCEPTING HUMAN WEAKNESS. IT&#39;S FUNNY BECAUSE, ON INSTAGRAM, PEOPLE OFTEN TALK ABOUT ME IN TERMS OF DARKNESS, CYNICISM, AND SATANISM. WORDS FROM PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T THINK TOO MUCH. BUT, YES, I&#39;M SHAKING THINGS UP. SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE FASHION TO BE HAPPY, LIKE WALT DISNEY&#39;S WORLD. THEY WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED AND REASSURED, LIKE CHILDREN AT DISNEYLAND. I SPEAK ABOUT WHAT WE GO THROUGH IN LIFE: INSECURITIES, DISAPPOINTMENTS, SORROWS, FEARS, ANXIETIES, AND THE QUEST FOR BEAUTY. PEOPLE FEEL THREATENED BECAUSE I SUGGEST THAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO ASPIRE TO THE STATUS QUO. IN AIRPORTS, WE&#39;RE ALWAYS PASSING THROUGH THESE SPACES SELLING BEAUTY PRODUCTS, WHICH, ABOVE ALL, SELL A NARROW, INTOLERANT VISION OF BEAUTY AND, THEREFORE, OF SEXUALITY. WE&#39;RE ASSIGNED AESTHETIC STANDARDS; IF WE DON&#39;T MEET THEM, WE&#39;RE ABNORMAL. I OFFER OTHER OPTIONS. YOU CAN FEEL SAFE OUTSIDE OF THESE AIRPORT STORES! YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO FOLLOW THEIR RULES. THAT&#39;S WHAT SCARES PEOPLE WHO CALL ME A SATANIST. AT ONE TIME, WITCHES WERE BURNED. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSATIONS AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T FIT THE MOLD. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. I IRRITATE THE PEOPLE I&#39;M TRYING TO IRRITATE. I DRESSED THE MODELS IN SHORT TUNICS FOR A FASHION SHOW WITH THEIR PENISES STICKING OUT. I DID THAT BECAUSE THE MEN&#39;S SHOW IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT MASCULINITY. BUT THE PENIS IS SO WELL PROTECTED... IT REPRESENTS POWER, AND SO EXPOSING IT IN THIS WAY, AT REST, BECOMES A THREAT. THE PHALLUS IS PROFANE, PRECIOUS, AND PROTECTED. WOMEN&#39;S BREASTS ARE NOT. EVEN WOMEN&#39;S GENDERS AREN&#39;T SO OFFENSIVE. THE PENIS REMAINS SHOCKING! SHOWING IT IN THIS WAY, IN MULTIPLIED FORM, WAS A WAY TO DEFLATE THE MYTH OF MASCULINE POWER. MY FAVORITE REACTION WAS FROM KARL LAGERFELD. HE WAS ON TV, AND WHEN ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT, HE REPLIED: &quot;IT&#39;S DISGUSTING TO SHOW ALL THAT DELICATESSEN FARE ON A RUNWAY.&quot; FOR SUCH AN INTELLIGENT MAN TO ADMIT FEELING THREATENED BY THIS... SURPRISED ME. SO BE CAREFUL! DON&#39;T PISS OFF THE PENIS! HOW DO YOU RELATE TO MASCULINITY? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU TODAY? I DON&#39;T THINK ABOUT IT. WAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN MASCULINE. SPORT IS CENTERED ON THE WHOLE IDEA OF COMPETITION, VICTORY, AND AGGRESSION. WHEN I FIRST STARTED, I WONDERED WHERE I GOT THE AGGRESSION THAT ALLOWED ME TO INSIST THAT WHAT I HAD TO SAY WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE LISTENED TO. WHAT&#39;S THE SOURCE OF THIS ARROGANCE? IT EMBARRASSED ME, BUT I&#39;M PROUD OF IT BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT TO GET WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. I DON&#39;T BELIEVE IN AGGRESSION. I&#39;M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ANY SIGN OF AGGRESSION. BUT I KNOW THAT I STILL HAVE IT IN ME. I KNOW WHEN I GET IMPATIENT AND WANT TO SLAP SOMEONE. I&#39;M 61 YEARS OLD; I SHOULD HAVE REACHED A LEVEL OF SERENITY AND PEACE. THEN I REMEMBER THAT I&#39;M A HUMAN BEING WHO GETS ANGRY... MAYBE I NEED A NICE GLASS OF WATER! [LAUGHS] SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE A JUDGMENTAL OUTLET. BUT I KNOW THE JUDGMENT WELL. I WENT THROUGH THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WHEN I WAS CALLED A FREAK AND A &quot;FAG&quot;. I ONCE READ THAT THE PRIMARY FORCES OF HUMAN BEINGS ARE GREED AND COMPETITION. SHIT ALWAYS STINKS. NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE BUILD AND TRAVEL, WE STILL HAVEN&#39;T FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE OUR SHIT STOP STINKING. LIFE IS STUPID. MAYBE IT&#39;S BECAUSE SHIT STINKS THAT LIFE ISN&#39;T BORING. YES! MY THERAPIST TOLD ME SO. I STARTED SEEING HIM LAST YEAR BECAUSE I FELT... HMM... I WANTED TO BE MORE SERENE. IT BOTHERED ME THAT I WASN&#39;T SOFTER, KINDER. WHY DO MY EMOTIONS ALWAYS COME OUT SO SHARPLY? HE TOLD ME: &quot;LET&#39;S SAY YOU&#39;VE REACHED THE STAGE OF SERENITY; WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN?&quot; OH, RIGHT, I GET IT! I&#39;D BE BORED... SO, DOES THIS MEAN I WILL BE SELF-SABOTAGING ALL MY LIFE? HE DIDN&#39;T ANSWER MY QUESTION. I TOLD HIM I FELT LIKE I&#39;D BECOME A BITTER OLD MAN, IRRITATED BY THE SLIGHTEST ANNOYANCE. IS THAT WHAT I AM? HE DIDN&#39;T SAY YES, BUT SOMETHING THE SAME. YOU THINK YOU ARE? I&#39;M SPOILED ROTTEN. YESTERDAY, I SAW AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN CROSSING THE ROAD WITH A WALKER. HE WAS GOING VERY SLOWLY. I WONDERED IF HE WERE AFRAID THE LIGHT WOULD TURN RED. THEN, IF HE LIVED ALONE, WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN HE WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND IF THIS WAS HIS ONLY OUTING OF THE DAY: SPENDING THREE HOURS TO BUY A LOAF OF BREAD? AND I&#39;M COMPLAINING ABOUT MY LIFE? WOULD I HAVE THE STRENGTH TO BE THIS GUY, AT HIS AGE, ALONE IN MY HOUSE WITH MY WALKER? THAT&#39;S DISTURBING. WHAT KIND OF CHILD WERE YOU? VERY DELICATE. MY PARENTS WERE OVERPROTECTIVE. I NEVER GOT DIRTY AND FOLLOWED THE OTHER KIDS ON THEIR ADVENTURES. I WAS AFRAID OF THE OTHER KIDS. I WAS TERRIFIED OF BEING NAKED IN THE LOCKER ROOM. I LIVED WITH MY OLD PARENTS; NOBODY EVER SAW ME NAKED. IT WAS A DELUGE OF SHAME AND ANGUISH FOR ME. WHEN I UNDERSTOOD MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION [RICK OWENS IS BISEXUAL] AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, I TOOK UP SPORTS AND CHANGED MY BODY, WHICH WAS VERY SOFT. SMALL SHOULDERS, ALMOST WOMANLY BREASTS, HIPS... I TOOK STEROIDS, TRANSFORMED MYSELF, AND FELT MORE CONFIDENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF SENSITIVE AND DELICATE YOUNG BOYS WHO DON&#39;T FIND THE STRENGTH TO DO THIS... AND WHO SHOULDN&#39;T EITHER! BUT I DID IT, AND IT WORKED. THE WORLD IS A VIOLENT PLACE, AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO TOUGHEN UP. DO YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC? MY PARENTS USED TO LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC. BY THE WAY, MICHÈLE AND I ARE WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY ON STRAVINSKY ON NETFLIX [STRAVINSKY: STRAVINSKY: ONCE AT A BORDER], WHICH IS MARVELOUS. LOTS OF WAGNER, SHOSTAKOVICH, STRAUSS, PUCCINI... THEN I DEVELOPED MY OWN TASTE WITH IGGY POP, BOWIE, MOTORHEAD, AND MINISTRY. MY FIRST CONCERT WAS DAVID BOWIE&#39;S STATION TO STATION IN 1974. THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING! BY THIS TIME, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW WAS ALREADY PART OF MY LIFE. A GREAT TIME FOR LETTING GO AND SELF-DISCOVERY. MUSIC IS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT IN YOUR SHOWS... I PREPARE ALL MY COLLECTIONS, STARTING WITH MUSIC AND SHOES. IT&#39;S THE FOUNDATION. FOR THE LAST SHOW, I ASKED PEACHES IF SHE HAD AN UNRELEASED TRACK. SHE SUGGESTED SEVERAL, AND I CHOSE ONE. THEN I LISTEN WHILE DESIGNING, FITTING, AND WORKING ON THE COLLECTION. AT THE SAME TIME, I&#39;M WORKING ON AN EXTENSION OF THE SONG, WHICH, IN ITS FINAL VERSION, SHOULD LAST AROUND FIFTEEN MINUTES. I DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. IT&#39;S THE SAME HABITAT. IN RECENT YEARS, I&#39;VE BEEN PLAYING SONGS BY BANDS THAT WERE IMPORTANT IN MY ADOLESCENCE, LIKE SISTERS OF MERCY. AND EVERYDAY MUSIC? NOW WE&#39;RE LISTENING TO JUDY GARLAND. IT&#39;S VINTAGE AND SOOTHING. IT HELPS ME DEAL WITH LIFE&#39;S DIFFICULTIES. WHEN I GO TO THE GYM, I LISTEN TO VERY VIOLENT TECHNO. DRIVING TO THE FOREST, I LISTEN TO OPERA. SO, I&#39;D SAY: JAZZ, OPERA, AND TECHNO. DO YOU LOOK FOR NEW MUSIC ON YOUR OWN? ALL THE TIME! I DON&#39;T REALLY HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM. RECENTLY, I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME NEW GABBER AND CAME ACROSS BRUTALISMUS 3000, WHICH I LOVE. THERE&#39;S ALSO EPROM BY THE SHADES DUO, WHOSE SAME TRACK I&#39;VE USED FOR ALL MY INSTAGRAM VIDEOS FOR YEARS, [HE CUTS JUDY GARLAND TO PLAY IT BACK REALLY LOUDLY]. I LOVE REPETITION. SHE SAYS SOMETHING LOYAL AND COHERENT. WOULD YOU SAY YOU&#39;RE OBSESSIVE? I LIKE TO EXPLORE. I LIKE TO STUDY. PEOPLE NEED CONSTANT STIMULATION. THEY NO LONGER UNDERSTAND HOW TO SLOW DOWN AND APPRECIATE SOMETHING. IT REMINDS ME OF LAGERFELD, WHO PROMOTED THE DISPOSABLE. HE&#39;S BEEN THROUGH SO MANY ERAS AND THINGS AND THROWN THEM AWAY. IN A WAY, HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FEROCITY OF THE FASHION WORLD, WHICH CONSUMES AND DISCARDS. I WANT TO BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE. WHEN I LIKE SOMETHING, I LINGER ON IT WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY REPLACING IT. THE CLOTHES I OFFER EVOLVE AT A CERTAIN PACE, SLOWER THAN WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT. NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SUPER-FAST. SO, NO TIKTOK? NOT YET, BUT VERY SOON! EVERYTHING I SEE ON TIKTOK IS ABOUT SPEED AND GREED. I WANT TO CREATE A CALM PRESENCE. I PUBLISHED A BOOK A LONG TIME AGO IN WHICH I SHAVE EYEBROWS. IT WAS A CEREMONY—A WAY OF BRINGING FREAKS INTO MY WORLD. I&#39;LL DO IT AGAIN. INVITING PEOPLE OVER AND FILMING MYSELF SHAVING THEIR EYEBROWS. I ALREADY HAVE SIX VIDEOS. IT&#39;S VERY INTIMATE, TRANSGRESSIVE, AND SLIGHTLY SEXUAL. IT&#39;S A FETISH EXPERIENCE! SO NOW YOU HAVE A PREVIEW OF MY TIKTOK. YOU SPEAK OF THE CEREMONY. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON RELIGION? I RESPECT IT VERY MUCH. RELIGION OFFERS A SET OF RULES THAT PEOPLE CAN CONSULT TO BEHAVE BETTER. THAT&#39;S THE GENERAL THING. DO YOU KNOW THE CHURCH OF SAINTE-CLOTILDE? I GO THERE A LOT. I USED TO GO THERE WITH MY PARENTS WHEN THEY CAME TO VISIT. MY MOTHER WAS CATHOLIC. NOW THAT THEY&#39;RE DEAD, I GO THERE AND THINK ABOUT THEM. IT&#39;S A PLACE OF CONTEMPLATION.

(I COULD LIST EXAMPLES BUT SOPHIA HAS ASKED ME TO KEEP IT PG.) SO, WHEN I WAS INVITED TO WRITE A STORY CHARTING MY HISTORY WITH RICK OWENS, I WENT BACK TO OUR VERY FIRST INTERVIEW – AN EMAIL AFFAIR FROM 2010 – AND DISCOVERED THIS TREASURE: “OVER THE PAST DECADE YOU HAVE GONE FROM BEING A FASHION DESIGNER TO A ‘FASHION DESIGNER AND PERSONALITY/ICON’,” 23-YEAR-OLD ANDERS OBSERVED. “IN YEARS TO COME, DO YOU SEE YOURSELF BECOMING A LAGERFELD-LIKE, SUPERHUMAN TYPE OF CHARACTER?”, I ASKED HIM. WRITING IN HIS SIGNATURE ALL-CAPS, RICK REPLIED: “I’M FLATTERED THAT YOU THINK I COULD MAINTAIN THAT KIND OF INTEREST. I DON’T THINK I HAVE THAT MUCH ENERGY.” A DECADE ON, WOULDN’T YOU KNOW IT, I’VE EMERGED AS SOMETHING OF A PROPHET. IN THE FLEETING WORLD OF POST-DIGITAL FASHION CULTURE, OWENS HAS MANIFESTED AS ONE OF THE MOST PERMANENT PHENOMENA IN THE INDUSTRY. AND IN A CREATIVE CLIMATE WHERE THE ARTISTIC DIRECTORS OF THE GRANDES MAISONS COME AND GO AND THE GENETICS OF HOUSES CAN TRANSFORM IN A SEASON, RICK OWENS AND THE BRAND THAT CARRIES HIS NAME HAVE BECOME ENDURING SYMBOLS OF COOL, OF AVANT-GARDE, OF INTELLIGENCE: AN ICON WHO STAYS TRUE TO HIS OWN TASTES AND VALUES WITHOUT EVER LOSING HIS DRIVE OR HIS TOUCH WITH THE CURRENT. IN FACT, HIS STATEMENTS – BOTH MATERIAL AND VOCAL – OFTEN FEEL AHEAD, FAR AHEAD, OF THE CURVE. BACKSTAGE, BEFORE HIS MEN’S SHOW THIS JANUARY, HE ENCAPSULATED THE CONSTANCY THAT CREATES THE BASE FOR THIS ENDURANCE. “THESE ARE THINGS WE’VE ALL SEEN FROM ME BEFORE, BUT WHEN THINGS ARE A GOOD IDEA, I THINK THEY’RE WORTH REPEATING,” HE SAID, REFERRING TO A COLLECTION THAT SERVED AS A REMINDER OF ALL THE RICK FOREVER-PIECES YOU WANT TO OWN BUT HAVEN’T ACQUIRED YET. “THE IDEA OF REDEVELOPING MOTIFS THAT ARE PART OF YOUR SIGNATURE, I THINK THAT’S A GOOD THING TO PUT OUT THERE: THE IDEA OF NOT LETTING THINGS BECOME DISPOSABLE, WHICH IS ALL TOO OFTEN THE CASE.” IT’S TRUE THAT OWENS’ WORK EVOLVES SLOWLY WITHIN A VERY DEFINED AESTHETIC, BUT CONTRARY TO OTHER DESIGNERS ABOUT WHOM YOU COULD SAY THE SAME, HIS SEASONAL EXPRESSIONS ARE FUELLED BY SO MUCH EMOTION – SO MUCH AWARENESS FOR THE WORLD THAT SURROUNDS HIM – THAT WE FEEL THE PROGRESS HE MAKES. WHEN, LIKE IN JANUARY, HE RAISES HIS MODELS UP ON AN ELEVATED RUNWAY AND PUTS THEM IN SKY-HIGH PLATFORMS SO THEY TOWER OVER US LIKE IMPOSING GIANTS IN CAPES, IT’S A MOVE THAT’S REFLECTIVE OF IN HIS OWN PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IT FELT LIKE HIS LITERAL WAY OF PUTTING THE WORLD INTO PERSPECTIVE. AS HE WROTE IN HIS SELF-PENNED SHOW NOTES, REFLECTING ON A RECENT TRIP TO THE PYRAMIDS: “MEASURING THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF CONTEMPORARY DISCOMFORTS AGAINST THAT AMOUNT OF HISTORY COMFORTS ME.” ALTHOUGH I’VE NEVER BEEN AS COOL AS THE KIDS WHO FLOCK TO HIS SHOWS IN HEAD-TO-TOE JEDI, OWENS HAS MEANT – AND CONTINUES TO MEAN – THE WORLD TO ME AND TO MY FASHION LIFE. AS SOMEONE WHO SHARES HIS SENSITIVITIES TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THIS DREAM WORLD OF OURS, THROUGH THE YEARS HE HAS BECOME MY SEASONAL JESUS: SOMEONE TO HEAR MY PRAYERS, SOMEONE WHO CARES. I KNOW THAT FASHION REFLECTS AND AFFECTS ITS SURROUNDING WORLD. I KNOW IT’S A FORCE FOR CHANGE. AND I HAVE NO QUALMS JUSTIFYING THE INDUSTRY I WORK IN. BUT ONCE IN A WHILE, AMID THE SELFIES AND POSES AND STREET STYLE AND AIR KISSES, IT’S COMFORTING TO HEAR HIS WORDS OF WISDOM – EVER SO POETIC, PHILOSOPHICAL, ASTUTE. I’M A SMARTER PERSON FOR KNOWING HIM. IN JANUARY, ALL HE COULD THINK ABOUT WAS UKRAINE. “I LOOK AROUND AND I SEE THINGS AND I CRINGE A LITTLE, THINKING, THEY KNOW THERE’S A WAR GOING ON, RIGHT? I REALISE, ALSO, THAT WE ARE COMPANIES THAT NEED TO BE ON THE TOP OF OUR GAME. WE REPRESENT THE VERY BEST OF THIS KIND OF INDUSTRY AND PEOPLE EXPECT EXCELLENCE. WE HAVE TO DELIVER THAT. WE CAN’T IGNORE THAT. BUT THERE ARE WAYS OF DELIVERING THAT EXCELLENCE WHICH AREN’T QUITE AS VORACIOUS AND CONSPICUOUSLY CONSUMPTIVE.” LAST YEAR, HE WAS FEELING THE WEIGHT OF THE REACTIONARY SOCIAL CLIMATE: “IT’S GETTING WORSE. ON EVERY NEW YORK TIMES STORY, THE COMMENTS ALWAYS DISINTEGRATE INTO BICKERING: PEOPLE NEEDING TO BE MORALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR TO SOMEONE WHO WROTE SOMETHING ELSE. NO MATTER HOW BENIGN OR GENTLE THE STORY IS, PEOPLE ALWAYS DESCEND TO DISGUSTING COMMENTS, WHICH IS BIGOTRY.” THESE QUOTES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY CONVERSATION I’LL HAVE WITH OWENS TODAY. WHETHER IT’S OVER DINNER, BACKSTAGE OR IN EMAILS, I CONSIDER HIM A KIND OF MESSIANIC THERAPIST. I EARNED MY OWENS EDUCATION IN THE “BUNKER IN BERCY”. IT’S HOW HE USED TO REFER TO THE GRASS-COVERED OMNI-SPORTS ARENA WHICH HOSTED SOME OF HIS MOST MEMORABLE SHOWS. BACK THEN, IT WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF THEATRE: THERE WAS THE SS13 SHOW FOR WHICH HE COVERED THE FLOOR IN FOAM; THERE WAS THE SS14 MEN’S SHOW WITH A PERFORMANCE BY THE METAL BAND WINNY PUHH, WHO WERE SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING; THERE WAS THE SS14 WOMEN’S SHOW MODELLED BY A FORMIDABLE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STEP TEAM. ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SOUNDTRACKS EVER STILL COMES FROM THAT OWENS ERA: IMA READ BY ZEBRA KATZ, WHICH SCORED HIS AW12 WOMEN’S SHOW AND CREATED ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL META MOMENTS I’VE EXPERIENCED IN A FASHION SHOW (PERHAPS ONLY OUTDONE BY KARL LAGERFELD’S SUPERMARKET SHOW FOR CHANEL, WHICH ENDED WITH GUESTS RUNNING TO THE SET TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THE MATERIAL GOODS). “IMA TAKE THAT BITCH TO COLLEGE, IMA GIVE THAT BITCH SOME KNOWLEDGE. IMA READ, IMA READ, IMA READ,” IT WENT, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT WAS STUNNING. BUT IN 2014, SOMETHING CHANGED. OWENS MOVED HIS SHOWS TO PALAIS DE TOKYO, THE MONUMENTAL, ART DECO MASTERPIECE ON THE RIVER SEINE. HERE, THE EVOLUTION OF THE PHILOSOPHER I KNOW TODAY WOULD TRULY BEGIN TO UNFOLD. SLOWLY, HIS GESTURES BECAME MORE POETIC. IT WAS HERE HE STAGED A SHOW MODELLED ENTIRELY BY HIS TEAM, WHERE HE CASUALLY PUT PENISES ON DISPLAY (“YOU KNOW I LOVE A SIMPLY TINY, LITTLE GESTURE THAT PACKS THE WALLOP”) AND WHEREHE STAGED MY FAVOURITE EVER DISPLAY OF WISDOM, FOR HIS SS18 MEN’S SHOW. FROM THE ROOF OF PALAIS DE TOKYO, IN THE SCORCHING SUMMER SUN, DESCENDED THE MOST EXQUISITE DARK TAILORING LIKE BLACK ANGELS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN MAJESTIC GAZAR, CLOQUÉ AND DUCHESSE. “IN THIS TIME OF HATE AND PAIN, WE NEED A REMEDY. I NEED A FREAK,” SAID OWENS AFTER THE SHOW, CITING THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SOUNDTRACK THAT DEFINED THE SHOW. AND THEN, HE SAID SOMETHING I’LL NEVER FORGET: “A FREAK TO ME IS SOMETHING RARE, SENSATIONAL, INSPIRED BY THE UNUSUAL. AND I’M SEEING THIS NORMALITY IN THE WORLD THAT’S KIND OF BEING LIONISED AND DEIFIED, AND PERSONALLY THAT’S MY REFRAIN: I NEED A FREAK IN LIFE. I NEED TO BE SURPRISED. I NEED EFFORT. AND I NEED THINGS TO BE RARE AND NOT BANAL. CELEBRATING THE PROSAIC AND CONVENTIONAL IS AMUSING BUT IT’S NOT THE SPIRIT OF MY SPIRIT. IT’S A LITTLE MEAN-SPIRITED. A LITTLE SNOTTY.” TO ME, THOSE WORDS STILL CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF MY LOVE FOR RICK OWENS, BOTH THE BRAND AND THE MAN. AS A FASHION PHENOMENON, IT IS ENTIRELY ITS OWN: AN INSTITUTION AT ONCE FAMILIAR AND COMPLETELY STRANGE; A SAFE HAVEN FOR ABNORMALITY, HONESTY AND BEAUTY. AS AN INDIVIDUAL, HE IS LIKE NO OTHER HUMAN I’VE EVER MET, THE RAREST, MOST DIFFERENT AND MOST UNCOMPROMISINGLY GENUINE PERSON TO HIT THIS PLANET; AN ARCH FREAK, WHO PUTS EVERY BIT OF HIS HEART INTO MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK, BEHAVE OR INDEED DRESS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE NORM. THROUGH THAT LENS, HE’S A KIND OF BEACON: A FASHION CONSTANT TO LIGHT THE WAY. IN MY EYES, HE’S CERTAINLY WAY UP THERE WITH KARL AND HIS KIND.

HERE IS A DESIGNER WHO, 30 YEARS AGO, DECIDED TO START A SMALL BRAND BY HIMSELF IN THE NAÏVE HOPE SOMEBODY WOULD HELP HIM TURN IT INTO A BUSINESS. AS FATE UNFOLDED, IT TURNS OUT THE IDEA WASN’T VERY NAÏVE AT ALL: RICK OWENS SITS ATOP THE MERIDIAN OF FASHION AND DESIGN AS AN ARTISTIC RENEGADE AND CONSUMER SUCCESS MODEL. HAVING SEARED HIS OWN MODEL OF CREATION ONTO OUR MEMORY, OWENS OCCUPIES A SINGULAR SPACE IN THE GLOBAL FASHION IMAGINATION. HIS PIECES CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS AN ORGANIC COTTON T-SHIRT OR AS MIND-EXPANDING AS HIS WEEPING ALABASTER WALL ARTWORK THAT TOURS AMERICAN MUSEUMS. LATELY, HIS TANK TOPS AND SNEAKERS HAVE GIVEN WAY TO A PHANTASMAGORIA OF ULTRA-SCULPTED PUFFERS, TWISTED HOLLYWOOD COLUMN GOWNS, TULLE ERUPTIONS, GLAM ROCK NYMPHO BOOTS AND SEVERE-SHOULDERED TATLIN COATS, AS WELL AS CONCRETE SCULPTURES AND FURNITURE FORGED FROM ALABASTER, FUR, OX BONE, AND 500,000-YEAR-OLD PETRIFIED WOODS FROM ITALIAN FORESTS. INDEPENDENT, EXTRAVAGANT, BRUTAL, AND OCCUPYING ITS OWN VERNACULAR, RICK OWENS IS A BRAND WITHOUT COMPROMISE, BUILT ON ITS OWN TERMS, AND OBSESSED OVER BY ITS OWN PARTICULAR CLIENTELE—PERHAPS THE MOST AUTHENTICALLY ALTERNATIVE AND FREAKY-FABULOUS, DECIDEDLY DEVOTIONAL CADRE OF CHARACTERS THE FASHION WORLD HAS YET SEEN. IT’S A FULL-BLOWN SCENE. OWENS HAS WHAT OTHER DESIGNERS COULD ONLY WISH FOR: A GENUINE SUBCULTURE ALL OF HIS OWN, AND ONE UTTERLY UNCONCERNED WITH THE LUXURY FASHION ESTABLISHMENT, WHICH HE DESCRIBES HERE AS “A COMPETITIVE SPORT WITH PLAYERS BEING BOUGHT AND TRADED AND STRATEGIES EXPOSED AND DEBATED.” HUMOUR, SPONTANEITY, DEDICATION TO CRAFT AND OBSESSIVENESS FUEL THE MAGIC TRICK, AND IT ALL COMES FROM A VERY REAL ATTITUDE THAT OTHER BRANDS FAKE. RICK SPEAKS TO US FROM PARIS AND HIS DISPATCHES COME IN LOUD AND CLEAR. PATRIK SANDBERG: WHERE ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? WHAT IS INSPIRING YOU LATELY? RICK OWENS: I’M IN PARIS WORKING ON THE SPRING PRECOLLECTION, ENJOYING MY NEIGHBOURHOOD. I’M VISITING NEW CAFES AND STOPPING BY MY FAVOURITE CHURCH, BASILIQUE SAINTE-CLOTILDE, AND ENJOYING THE PARKS IN MY AREA. I’M EXPLORING AND APPRECIATING MY IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS AS IF I WERE ON A VACATION. I’M FEELING THERE IS AS MUCH TO DISCOVER IMMEDIATELY AROUND ME AS A TRIP TO THE MOON. PS: LUXURY FEELS LIKE IT’S IN UPHEAVAL, OR MAYBE UPHEAVAL HAS BECOME THE NORM. WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND AT THE ECOSYSTEM OF LUXURY FASHION IN PARIS AND MILAN, WHAT CONCERNS YOU THE MOST? RO: I’M ALWAYS REACTING (GENTLY, I HOPE) AGAINST THE NARROWNESS OF THE ASPIRATIONAL BEAUTY THAT IS SO STRIDENTLY PROMOTED IN OUR CULTURE—LIKE THE GAUNTLETS OF PERFUME ADS WE ARE FORCED TO MARCH THROUGH IN AIRPORTS. ADS PROMOTING A VERY SPECIFIC KIND OF PRIVILEGE AND ENTITLEMENT AND SEXUALITY. I CERTAINLY DON’T REJECT OR CONDEMN THEM, BUT I WANT TO BE SOMEONE WHO PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE AND, IN MY OWN WAY, DIVERSITY. BUT I CERTAINLY DON’T THINK MY WAY IS THE ONLY WAY, JUST A PROPOSAL. PS: WHAT IS MOST ENCOURAGING ABOUT THE FASHION CLIMATE NOW? WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE CURRENT STATE OF GLAMOUR? RO: FASHION HAS BECOME MUCH MORE OF A COMPETITIVE SPORT WITH PLAYERS BEING BOUGHT AND TRADED AND STRATEGIES EXPOSED AND DEBATED. THIS ALL JUST MAKES NICHE BRANDS WITH NUANCED AND GENUINE STORIES STAND OUT ALL THE MORE. I DON’T REALLY CONSIDER MYSELF EITHER, BUT I THINK EITHER ARE EQUALLY VALID. I LOVE CORRUPTION AND I LOVE SUBVERSION. PS: I NO LONGER ATTEND FASHION WEEK, HAVING CHANGED CAREERS DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT YOUR SHOWS IN PARIS WERE ALWAYS MY FAVOURITE TO ATTEND, AND I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN THE VENICE SHOWS. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FASHION SHOW FORMAT NOW? RO: I HAVE NEVER WAVERED IN MY OPINION OF FASHION SHOWS—ANY EXCUSE FOR PEOPLE TO GATHER TOGETHER TO COLLECTIVELY BOND OVER A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF LIFE. RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS ARE A FASHION SHOW, FOOTBALL GAMES ARE FASHION SHOWS. ALL THESE FORMATS ARE GREAT. LET’S NOT BE GREEDY AND DEMAND SURPRISES EVERY MINUTE. PS: I’VE HEARD PEOPLE SAYING THE IDEA OF SUBCULTURE IS ANTIQUATED, THAT SUBCULTURES ARE NO LONGER POSSIBLE DUE TO THE ATOMISED CULTURAL EXPERIENCE WE ALL LIVE IN NOW. YET, THE MEDIA TO ME SEEMS TO BE A MONOCULTURE MORE THAN EVER, AT LEAST IN THE US. AND ENTERTAINMENT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY MONOPOLISED BY THE BIG STREAMERS. IS IT POSSIBLE TO OCCUPY A SUBCULTURE TODAY? OR TO EVEN SIMPLY PROMOTE THE IDEA OF ONE? IF YOU WERE TO START A NEW SUBCULTURE, WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? WHAT WOULD YOU INCLUDE IN YOUR MANIFESTO? RO: THE MANIFESTO WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME— PROTESTING THE GENERATION THAT CAME BEFORE YOU. AND SUBCULTURES WILL ALWAYS EXIST, LIKE THE GLAMOROUS MONSTERS MATIERES FECALES AND DAHC DERMUR WHO FULLY LIVE THEIR AESTHETIC EVERY DAY, NOT JUST AS DRESS-UP FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION. THAT’S THE KIND OF COMMITMENT THAT INSPIRES ME. THEY FOLLOW IN THE LONG AND HONOURABLE TRADITION OF THE MARCHESA CASATI, ANNA PIAGGI, LEIGH BOWERY. PS: A NEW WAVE OF MORAL PANIC HAS EMERGED RECENTLY OVER IMAGERY AND WORDS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE. IS THERE A PLACE FOR LIFESTYLES AND ATTITUDES THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE NORM? RO: DEALING WITH BULLIES WILL JUST HELP US INVENT AND DEVELOP BETTER DEFENSIVE SKILLS. ALWAYS HAS. PS: IS THERE A FUTURE FOR SLEAZE? RO: SLEAZE IS ETERNAL PS: YOU’VE TALKED ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH A MEMENTO MORI CAN REMIND YOU NOT TO TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY. IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF “GALLOWS HUMOUR”, AND YOUR COLLECTIONS. THERE IS HUMOUR AND LEVITY TO THEM EVEN THOUGH THE COMMON PERCEPTION IS ONE OF DARKNESS. HOW DO YOU FEEL LIGHTNESS AND DARKNESS INTERPLAY IN YOUR WORK? RO: HUMOUR IS THE MOST ELEGANT THING IN THE WORLD— THERE IS NOTHING MORE CHIC THAN NOT TAKING YOURSELF TOO SERIOUSLY. ANY DARKNESS THAT I PRESENT IS DONE SO WITH A WINK—SURE, THERE IS A RESIGNATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE BEAUTY AND THE HORRORS OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND AN UNBLINKERED AWARENESS THAT DISAPPOINTMENTS AND SOME PAINS ARE INEVITABLE AND PART OF LIFE. THESE ARE ISSUES WE ARE ALL GRAPPLING WITH AND THAT I EXPLORE IN WHAT I PROPOSE. THE BEST ADVICE MY FATHER EVER GAVE ME WAS, “RICHARD, LIFE ISN’T FAIR”. PS: THIS ISSUE OF BUFFALO IS ALL ABOUT STRIPPING THINGS DOWN TO THE ESSENTIALS. IT’S THE FIRST ALL-BLACK- AND-WHITE-ISSUE. WHAT DOES BLACK AND WHITE EVOKE FOR YOU? WHICH IMAGES OR MOVIES COME TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF BLACK AND WHITE? PS: YOUR RECENT COLLECTION, EDFU, EVOKES THE ANCIENT AND ALSO THE ALIEN—MAYBE THE PAST IS AS ALIEN TO US AS THE FUTURE. MAYBE THEY BEND SO FAR AWAY FROM US THAT THEY BECOME QUITE THE SAME THING. DO YOU THINK WE ARE HEADING TOWARD A PRIMITIVE FUTURE? RO: AS FUTURISTIC AND SOPHISTICATED AS WE GET, LIFE WILL ALWAYS BE DUMB. OUR SHIT STILL STINKS. THE ETERNAL CYCLE OF CONCEIVING OF UTOPIAN VISIONS WILL RESULT IN THE ATTEMPT TO FORCE THEM ON OTHER PEOPLE, DEFEAT AND REPEAT. I ALWAYS ASSOCIATE UTOPIA WITH DOOM. UPSIDE-DOWN SMILEY FACE EMOJI. PS: YOU ALSO BRING ABOUT A NEW EXPRESSION OF OPULENCE IN A WAY THAT IS PERVERSELY HOLLYWOOD, WITH LARGE VOLUMES, CORUSCATING, TRANSLUCENT LEATHERS AND BIG POOFS OF TULLE. ARE THERE ANY FILMS CURRENTLY ON YOUR MIND? RO: I HAVE BEEN WATCHING TOP HAT WITH FRED ASTAIRE ON REPEAT WITH THE SOUND OFF RECENTLY. THE BLACKAND- WHITE FROTH AND ARTIFICE AND HIS DANCING ARE INVIGORATING AND INSPIRING. PS: EVERYONE IS SAYING MOVIE STARS ARE DEAD. WOULD THIS BE A LOSS? RO: WE HAVE ALWAYS NEEDED GODS AND GODDESSES TO MYTHOLOGISE—THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ASPIRATIONAL FIGURES THAT WILL HAVE ALLURE AND LEGEND. PS: WHO IS THE LAST SUPERSTAR YOU BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH OR AWARE OF? RO: I WAS THRILLED BY RIHANNA’S HALFTIME SHOW. WHAT OTHER PEOPLE CONSIDERED LACK OF ENERGY, I SAW AS LACK OF DESPERATION. HER NONCHALANT BUT CAREFULLY EDITED MOVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE REMINDED ME OF MARLENE DIETRICH, WHOSE CABARET SHOWS ARE A STANDARD OF ELEGANT CONTROL AND ARCH HUMOUR FOR ME. PS: A LOT OF INDEPENDENT DESIGNERS ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN A BUSINESS IN THE LONG TERM AND YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED AT IT. MANY DESIGNERS LOOK UP TO YOU BUT STILL CANNOT WEATHER THE MARKET AND THE SYSTEM. WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE FOR SOMEONE JUST BEGINNING TO CREATE A BRAND OR A LINE TODAY? RO: ALL I DID WAS JUST KEEP MY STUFF OUT THERE NO MATTER WHAT IT TOOK. ALL IN MY OWN DIY WAY UNTIL I COULD ATTRACT SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP—I HAD NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO RUN A BUSINESS BY MYSELF. AND MIRACULOUSLY, MY NAIVE LITTLE PLAN WORKED AND I AM STILL WITH THE SAME PARTNERS WHO FOUND ME ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO. I HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE AN OBSCURE BUT AUTHENTIC ECCENTRIC LIVING IN SQUALOR FOREVER, BUT THINGS TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY. PS: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY NOW THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER? RO: I WOULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER. PS: YOU’VE DESIGNED FASHION, FURNITURE, OWENSCORP FACILITIES, OFFICES, CAFES. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU HAVE YET TO DESIGN THAT YOU PLAN TO TRY? A MALL? A SPORTS CAR? A SPACESHIP? RO:I HAVEN’T DONE A WALLED GARDEN YET—THAT’S NEXT.

WHEN HE LAUNCHED HIS “GRUNGE MEETS GLAMOR” LABEL OUT OF A SMALL STOREFRONT ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN 1994, FEW PREDICTED THE INFLUENCE HE WOULD HAVE. SINCE THEN, HE HAS PUSHED INTO NEW TERRITORY, AS HE DID WHEN HE LAUNCHED A FURNITURE LINE IN 2006. NOW, ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AFTER HE BEGAN, WHILE HIS DESIGNS CAN BE PERCEIVED BY SOME AS INTENSE AND INTIMIDATING, IT’D BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THEY REPRESENT THE SPIRIT OF OWENS. IN FACT, THE 61 YEAR-OLD OWENS IS ONE OF THE SWEETEST PEOPLE ONE COULD HAVE THE GOOD LUCK TO SPEND TIME WITH. A KIND, THOUGHTFUL MAN WHO IS QUICK TO LAUGH AND SHARE HIS WARM AND REASSURING SMILE, OWENS SPENT PART OF AN AFTERNOON WITH US, SHARING HIS INSIGHTS INTO HOW HIS HOMES ACROSS THE YEARS HAVE SHAPED HIS SENSE OF FASHION AND DESIGN, AS WELL AS HOW THEY FEED HIS CREATIVITY. WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW? I’M IN MY HOUSE IN PARIS, THE HOUSE I’VE BEEN LIVING IN FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. AFTER THIS LAST SHOW IN MARCH, I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO HAVE A QUIET RETREAT AT HOME. I DIDN’T WANT TO TRAVEL. I WANTED TO REACQUAINT MYSELF WITH MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND EXPLORE IT AND TREAT IT LIKE I WOULD DO A TRIP SOMEWHERE EXOTIC. SO I’VE BEEN GOING TO THE LITTLE CHURCH AROUND THE CORNER FROM MY HOUSE. I’VE BEEN GOING TO THE GYM AT THE HOTEL DOWN THE STREET. I’VE TRIED NEW CAFES IN THE AREA. I SPEND TIME ON MY TERRACE THAT OVERLOOKS THE GARDEN OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. AND IT’S JUST BEAUTIFUL BIRDS AND BEAUTIFUL TREES. IT’S REALLY THE PERFECT PLACE TO BE, OUR CORNER OF PARIS. IT’S VERY QUIET. IT’S ON A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE SQUARE, PALAIS BOURBON. I LIKE WHAT YOU’RE SAYING BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT’S THAT THING WHERE YOU GO AWAY AND YOUR EYE IS REFRESHED AND YOU SAY, I WANT TO HOLD ON TO THIS PERSPECTIVE. BUT THEN YOU GET HOME AND IF YOU DON’T STAY ALIVE TO THAT FEELING, YOUR EYES GLAZE OVER. YEAH. AND I DON’T WANNA GET INTO THAT SENSE OF ALWAYS LOOKING FOR STIMULATION AND THINKING THAT YOU’RE GONNA FIND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THINKING THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING FROM ONE POINT OF STIMULATION TO ANOTHER POINT OF STIMULATION. LIKE, OH, WE HAVE TO GO TO A PARTY AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO A SPOT IN SWITZERLAND TO RECOVER FROM IT. THEN WE HAVE TO GO TO SOME SHOW IN LONDON… WELL, AND THAT’S AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD OF A LIFE IN FASHION. BUT I UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAPPENS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MORE OF A SENSE OF ADVENTURE THAN I DO, SO IT’S EASY FOR ME TO BE SATISFIED WITH LESS. MAYBE I’M ALSO JUST GETTING OLDER. YOU’RE LESS SATISFIED, YOU KNOW? LIKE, YOU GO SOMEWHERE AND YOU’RE THINKING, I SCHLEPPED HERE FOR THIS? AND IT’S KIND OF MORE TROUBLE THAN IT WAS WORTH. (LAUGHS) I’M TURNING INTO A CRANKY OLD FUCK, AREN’T I? YOU’RE NOT A CRANKY OLD FUCK. IT’S JUST ABOUT WISDOM. KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT AS YOU MOVE THROUGH LIFE. HERE’S A QUESTION: WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE A MONTH IN A SIMPLE CABIN UP IN THE DOLOMITES, WITH ONLY A BED AND A TABLE, THAN A MONTH ON LAKE COMO AT VILLA D’ESTE? I’D TAKE VILLA D’ESTE. NOW YOU’RE BLOWING MY MIND. THAT’S ONE OF THE MOST MAGICAL PLACES ON THE PLANET. BUT GRANTED, I DO SPEND MY SUMMER IN LIDO AND I HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL APARTMENT IN A VERY RESIDENTIAL AREA IN THE LIDO VILLAGE. AND IT’S SUPER NON-FABULOUS. SO, I DID THAT DELIBERATELY BECAUSE I DIDN’T WANT THERE TO BE A STEADY BUZZ OF STIMULATION IN MY LIFE IN SUMMER. I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS LIVE IN NEW YORK. THERE’S ALWAYS A SENSE THERE’S A PARADE OUTSIDE, THAT YOU’RE MISSING SOMETHING IF YOU STAY INSIDE. I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT PARIS. NOT A PARADE I’M MISSING. BUT IF I’M INSIDE, THEN I’M NOT OUTSIDE SEEING THE LIGHT AND SKY AND BEAUTY. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I’M REALLY CONSCIOUS OF IS THAT MY SENSE OF VALIDATION HAS BEEN SATISFIED WAY MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE EVER GET TO HAVE HAPPEN TO THEM. BECAUSE I’VE EXPRESSED MYSELF AND IT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY AND EMBRACED BY SO MANY PEOPLE. I NEVER EXPECTED THAT TO HAPPEN. AND THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE BLESSING BECAUSE COMMUNICATION AND WANTING TO CONNECT, WANTING TO BE HEARD, BY PEOPLE—THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN MOTIVATIONS OF LIFE. AND I’VE REALLY BEEN LUCKY THERE. I’VE REALLY BEEN SATISFIED THERE. I’VE HAD ENGAGEMENT, AND I REALIZE HOW FORTUNATE THAT IS. SO I’M ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF THAT. I REALLY LUCKED OUT IN GETTING THAT KIND OF VALIDATION. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT REALIZE WHAT A GIFT THAT IS. I TALKED TO SOMEBODY WHO SOLD THEIR COMPANY AND I WAS WONDERING HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE BUILT SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE SO CONNECTED TO, AND THEN WALK AWAY FROM THAT. TO WALK AWAY FROM SOMETHING THAT HAS MOMENTUM AND IS MOVING AND IT IS A CALL AND RESPONSE TO THE WORLD AROUND YOU. HOW DO YOU WALK AWAY FROM THAT? JUST RETREAT TO YOUR GARDEN? IT’S LIKE A GENERAL WITH AN ARMY. FOR INSTANCE, EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT FASHION BEING SO FAST. I WOULDN’T WANT IT ANY SLOWER. NOT FOR ME. I LOVE THE CYCLES OF THE SEASONS AND THE COLLECTIONS AND I LOVE THE ASSIGNMENT OF HAVING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND MAKING IT ALL FIT TOGETHER. AND I LOVE DOING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT’S MY CROSSWORD PUZZLE OF LIFE. SO I WOULD BE TERRIFIED IF I HAD TO LET GO OF THAT. (LAUGHS) IF YOU COULD CONCEIVE THE PERFECT ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE, WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? AT THE POMPIDOU, THERE IS A JOSEPH BEUYS ROOM THAT IS ALL PANELED WITH FELT, AND IT HAS A BLACK GRAND PIANO IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. AND THEN THERE’S A CARL ANDRE LEAD FLOOR, JUST LEAD TILES ON THE FLOOR. AND THEN THERE IS A GIUSEPPE PENONE ROOM THAT IS BALES OF LAUREL LEAVES. AND WHEN YOU WALK IN, YOU CAN SMELL THE LAUREL LEAVES. AND I ALWAYS THINK THAT’S MY IDEAL HOUSE. THOSE THREE ROOMS. IF I COULD HAVE ALL THREE OF THOSE, THAT WOULD BE MY FANTASY. THAT, OR A FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE. ALTHOUGH, I WENT BACK TO LOS ANGELES LAST YEAR, AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I’VE BEEN IN 27 YEARS. BECAUSE I REALLY DON’T GO BACK TO THE STATES THAT MUCH. AND FOR SOME REASON WHEN I LIVED IN HOLLYWOOD, I HADN’T DEVELOPED MY TASTE FOR ARCHITECTURE. I DON’T KNOW WHY. I JUST WASN’T INTERESTED IN ARCHITECTURE SO I NEVER VISITED HOLLYHOCK HOUSE, THE FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT-DESIGNED HOME IN HOLLYWOOD. AND SO I WENT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO BE. EXCEPT IT WAS MINIATURE. THE SPACES WOULD’VE BEEN SO AMAZING IF THEY WERE JUST TEN TIMES BIGGER. (LAUGHS) THE CEILINGS ARE ALWAYS LOW IN HIS HOMES. NOT MADE FOR TALL GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME. AND IT’S STRANGE BECAUSE HE’S KNOWN FOR BANDS OF LIGHT, ALL THE WINDOWS, AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT. YOU WANT THE WINDOWS TO BE FIVE TIMES AS TALL. BUT THEN I GUESS THAT WOULD THROW OUT THE DYNAMIC OF IT. WOULD IT? BECAUSE THEN, YOU KNOW, I WALK OUTSIDE THE LOUVRE AND THOSE COLONNADES ARE SO HIGH. YOU’RE THINKING, PEOPLE WERE SMALLER THEN AND THEY DIDN’T HAVE EFFICIENT HEATING. AND STILL THEY INSISTED THAT THE CEILINGS BE THAT HIGH. (LAUGHS) WHEN YOU WENT BACK TO CALIFORNIA, WHAT ELSE CAUGHT YOUR EYE, IN TERMS OF DESIGN? WELL IT WAS DURING COVID AND I WAS STAYING AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT AND IT’S FUNNY BECAUSE MICHELE AND I HAD LIVED IN THE CHATEAU WHEN I STARTED MY COLLECTION. BACK THEN, THIS WAS 1992 OR SO I THINK, I HAD A SEWING MACHINE AND A CUTTING TABLE IN OUR LIVING ROOM. AND WE WEREN’T RICH. MICHELE HAD THE RESTAURANT, LES DEUX CAFE, AND IT WAS VERY HAND TO MOUTH. AND THAT WAS A TIME WHERE WE WERE STAYING IN ONE OF THE ROOMS IN THE BACK OF THE HOTEL, OVER THE KITCHEN. AND OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS, YOU COULD SEE THE HILL GOING UP, WITH THE BUILDINGS ON THE HILL AND ALL OF THE GREENERY AND EVERYTHING. I CREATED MY FIRST COLLECTION THERE. IT’S FUNNY, BUT ALL OF THAT STUFF, EVERY SINGLE PIECE IS STILL IN THE COLLECTION EVERY SEASON. BUT WHEN I WENT BACK THIS TIME, THEY GAVE ME A ROOM THAT WAS HIGHER, BUT IT WAS IN THE SAME CORNER. I THINK IT WAS ONE FLOOR ABOVE THE ROOM THAT WE USED TO LIVE IN. AND I OPENED THE WINDOWS AND THERE WAS JUST THIS RUSH OF EMOTION FROM RECOGNIZING THE SMELL, RECOGNIZING THE CONFIGURATION OF THE ROOM, BEING BACK AT THAT SPOT. I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S JASMINE OR IF IT WAS THE IVY OR IF IT WAS THE TREES, BUT THAT COMBINATION OF THAT GREENERY AND THE ROOM, IT WAS VERY MOVING. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THE CHATEAU IS SUCH A SYMBOL OF LOS ANGELES AND HOLLYWOOD, BUT IT’S ALSO LIKE A SYMBOL OF MY PAST LIFE, AND MY PERSONAL LIFE AND MY CAREER. BUT WHAT WAS FUNNY IS WHEN I FINALLY WENT BACK TO PORTERVILLE [CALIFORNIA, THE TOWN WHERE I WAS RAISED] TO GO SEE MY MOM. I HADN’T BEEN THERE AND I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD WANT TO GO BACK BECAUSE IT WAS A PLACE THAT I HAD GROWN UP FEELING BULLIED AND UNRESOLVED AND AMBITIOUS. AND A LITTLE BIT HOPELESS. IT HAD BEEN A CHALLENGING PLACE TO GROW UP IN. A VERY CONSERVATIVE, SMALL TOWN AND VERY JUDGMENTAL. SO I ALWAYS THOUGHT, I’M NEVER GOING BACK THERE. LIKE, FUCK THAT. AND SO I WENT TO VISIT MOM, AND I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW THERE WAS SUCH A WAVE OF COMFORT IN BEING THERE; A WAVE OF BELONGING AND FEELING GOOD. I TOTALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW GREAT IT WOULD FEEL TO COME BACK AT FULL POWER. TO FEEL LIKE I WON. (LAUGHS) YEAH. I HADN’T ANTICIPATED THAT AT ALL. AND IT WAS LIKE A TOTAL SURPRISE. SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE GOING BACK TO YOUR BOYHOOD HOME? WELL, IT WASN’T MY BOYHOOD HOME. IT’S A FUNNY STORY. MY DAD, AS HE HAD GOTTEN OLDER, HE’D GOTTEN VERY KIND OF DARK AND CRANKY. HE WAS KIND OF AN OPPRESSIVE, DARK SPIRIT, DARK ENERGY, WHICH WAS ALWAYS A SURPRISE TO ME BECAUSE HE’D ALWAYS BEEN SOMEBODY WHO STUDIED PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY. AND HE BELIEVED IN CLASSICAL LITERATURE AND CLASSICAL MUSIC, AND LIVING THOUGHTFULLY WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM, I WOULD’VE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD’VE FOUND A WAY TO FIND SERENITY AS HE AGED. BUT IT WAS THE OPPOSITE. THE OLDER HE GOT, THE MORE INTOLERANT HE BECAME. SO I TOLD MOM, WE’RE GOING TO BUY YOU A HOUSE ACROSS TOWN. YOU’RE GOING TO DECORATE IT. AND SHE DID. FRILLY CURTAINS. GOLD MIRRORS. PILLOWED FURNITURE WITH FRINGE AND TASSELS. AND EVERY DAY, SHE TOLD DAD THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LUNCH WITH HER FRIENDS. BUT SHE WOULD GO OUT TO THE HOUSE. SOME DAYS, JUST TO TAKE A NAP. SOME DAYS TO PLAY CARDS WITH HER FRIENDS AT THE HOUSE. (LAUGHS) AND DAD NEVER FOUND OUT. HE PASSED AWAY NEVER KNOWING THAT SHE HAD THIS SECRET LIFE. (LAUGHS) IS THERE ANYTHING FROM YOUR OWN CHILDHOOD HOME THAT INFLUENCES YOUR FURNITURE DESIGN? ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE, DAD, YOU KNOW, I CRITICIZE HIM SO MUCH, BUT I DO PRAISE HIM. AND I’M VERY GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR HAVING A BEAUTIFUL LIBRARY AND NOT ALLOWING A TV IN THE HOUSE UNTIL I WAS 16. HE HAD A LIBRARY FULL OF JAPANESE ABSTRACT INK BRUSH PAINTINGS, AND ENCYCLOPEDIAS OF ALL OF THE MUSEUMS OF THE WORLD. AND HE LOVED SILENT MOVIES, SO HE HAD A LOT OF BOOKS ON SILENT MOVIES. AND SO THIS IS WHAT I HAD TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF WITH AS A BOY. AND AMONG ALL OF THE SILENT MOVIE BOOKS, THERE WAS A LOT OF CECIL B. DEMILLE IMAGERY AND FRITZ LANG. AND YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONLY MAYBE TEN YEARS AGO I FINALLY SAW FRITZ LANG’S THE NIBELUNGS, AND WHEN I SAW IT, I REALIZED, OH, I HAD SEEN THESE IMAGES A LOT IN MY CHILDHOOD. AND THEY FORMED MY AESTHETIC. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT MOVIE NOW, IT’S LIKE I DESIGNED IT. IT’S LIKE ALL OF MY FURNITURE IS IN IT. ALL OF THE CLOTHES ARE IN IT. EVEN THE WAY THE PEOPLE LOOK—THESE HEROIC, STOIC FACES. IT’S LIKE I LIFTED MY WHOLE AESTHETIC FROM THIS MOVIE WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT. AND ALSO METROPOLIS BY FRITZ LANG AND ALL OF THE BIBLICAL MOVIES BY CECIL B. DEMILLE, BECAUSE AT THE SAME TIME I WAS GOING TO A CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND WE HAD MASS EVERY MORNING. SO I HAD A STRONG SENSE OF MORALITY AND ETHICS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE EXOTIC GLAMOR OF THESE NUNS IN THESE DRAPED ROBES IN OUR JUDGMENTAL HICK TOWN. SO THAT TAUGHT ME YOU CAN BELONG TO AN OTHERNESS AND RETREAT INTO YOUR OWN AESTHETIC WORLD. AND ALSO THOSE BIBLICAL EPICS, THEY ALWAYS HAD A MORAL ENDING BUT THEY ALWAYS RELISHED AND SHOWED YOU ALL THE SIN THAT IT TOOK TO GET THERE. SO THEY WERE MORAL, BUT VERY LURID AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW, THERE’S ALLIGATORS EATING VIRGINS IN THE COLISEUM AND EVERYTHING IS THROUGH AN ART DECO FILTER. AND THE MAKEUP I DO IS FROM THAT ERA. AND LIKE BIASED DRESSES, BIASED ROBES… AND IT’S ALL IN BLACK AND WHITE. IT’S FASCINATING THAT THE TEMPLATE WAS SET BACK IN YOUR BOYHOOD. IT’S AMAZING. BUT ALSO SO LOGICAL AND INEVITABLE. BECAUSE THAT IS YOUR MOMENT OF CREATIVE AWAKENING. YOU’RE CHOOSING, YOU’RE LOOKING AROUND. CHOOSING YOUR FAVORITE THINGS. AND THEY STAY WITH YOU FOREVER BECAUSE THAT IS HOW YOU STAY AUTHENTIC. BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU LOVED WHEN YOU WERE FIRST AWAKENING CREATIVELY. SO THERE’S THAT SENSE OF LOYALTY BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHERE YOU WERE ENGINEERED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. WHAT WAS BEHIND YOUR DESIRE TO BEGIN TO DESIGN FURNITURE? IT WAS CREATING AN AESTHETIC. LIKE PROTECTING MYSELF AESTHETICALLY AS MUCH AS I COULD. MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING REACHED AN AESTHETIC STANDARD THAT I WAS COMFORTABLE WITH. AND I’M NOT ASKING FOR THE MOON. WELL, I WAS THEN, BECAUSE I WAS THINKING ALL I REALLY WANTED WAS EILEEN GRAY AND ROBERT MALLET- STEVENS FURNITURE. (LAUGHS) BUT THEN I THOUGHT, I’M GONNA DO MY INTERPRETATION OF THAT AESTHETIC. OF BAUHAUS AND ART DECO AND BRUTALIST. I’M GOING TO DO MY INTERPRETATION, BECAUSE I CAN. BECAUSE I WANTED TO LIVE IN A CERTAIN KIND OF AESTHETIC BUBBLE. AND I STILL DO. YEAH, THAT’S WHY I DID IT. THAT’S BEAUTIFUL. IT WASN’T LIKE, I’M GONNA START A FURNITURE COLLECTION. IT WAS MORE LIKE, I’M GONNA FURNISH MY HOUSE. I NEED PLACES TO SIT AND I WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE THIS. AND THEN I LOOKED AROUND AND THOUGHT, THIS WOULD BE A KEY THING TO PRESENT AS A FURNITURE COLLECTION DURING ONE OF OUR MEN’S SHOWS. SO THAT’S WHAT WE DID. AND IT WAS MEANT TO BE KIND OF A ONE SHOT DEAL, BUT THEN IT JUST KIND OF HELD ON AND IT WAS FUN TO DO AND IT JUST KIND OF DEVELOPED. AND THEN MICHELE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO NURTURE THAT AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING. AND SO THAT’S WHAT HAPPENED. I MEAN, SHE DOES A MILLION OTHER THINGS. BUT SHE’S ALWAYS DEVELOPING IT AND FINDING NEW MARBLES, NEW PETRIFIED WOOD, NEW ALABASTER. SHE IS COORDINATING ALL OF THAT AND DEVELOPING IT. IT BECAME HER BABY. DO YOUR CLOTHING DESIGNS FEED THE FURNITURE DESIGNS? I HAVEN’T FIGURED IT OUT LITERALLY. BUT I’M SURE THAT IN TEN YEARS WE’LL LOOK BACK AND WE’LL SEE HOW IT WORKED. IN THE FURNITURE I’M MOVING MORE TOWARDS STEEL BECAUSE WE WERE SO ORGANIC FOR A WHILE USING ANTLERS AND PLYWOOD. AND NOW I’M LIKING THE HARDNESS AND THE CLINICAL LOOK OF METAL. AND THEN I DID A FEW OTHER THINGS IN ALUMINUM. FOR MONCLER LAST MONTH WE PRESENTED A BED. IT’S FUNNY: WE HAD SOME CONSTRUCTION HAPPENING AROUND THE HOUSE. AND IT WAS MAKING ME CRAZY. AND I WAS THINKING, WHAT DO I NEED PERSONALLY NOW WHEN IT COMES TO FURNITURE? AND, CONCEPTUALLY I WAS THINKING, I NEED SOMETHING THAT I CAN MAKE AN EASY QUICK RETREAT INTO. I NEED A SAFE ROOM. SO I MADE THIS GEOMETRIC BED THAT SEALS SHUT. IT’S SOUNDPROOF AND IT HAS A VENTILATION SYSTEM INSIDE AND IT HAS VIDEO AND CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING, BUT IT IS VERY INSULATED. IT’S LIKE A PRIVATE LITTLE SPACESHIP/PYRAMID/ISOLATION POD. YOU’VE SAID IN THE PAST “DOMESTICITY IS FUSSY” BUT IS THERE ANYTHING FROM YOUR BOYHOOD THAT YOU STILL HAVE, THAT IS A BIT OF A TOTEM FOR YOU? NO, BUT YOUR QUESTION REMINDS ME THAT WHEN WE WERE POOR IN HOLLYWOOD, AT ONE POINT WE LIVED IN THESE STOREFRONTS ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AND THE PROPORTIONS WERE BEAUTIFUL. THEY USED TO BE THESE STOREROOMS FOR A MAGAZINE STAND DOWN THE STREET. THEY HAD HIGH CEILINGS AND CONCRETE WALLS. AND IN ONE OF THE SPACES I COMPLETELY LINED IT WITH GRAY WOOL ARMY BLANKETS FROM THE ARMY SURPLUS STORE DOWN THE STREET. AND I MADE A BED THAT I COVERED IN ARMY BLANKETS. AND WE STILL SELL THAT BED. WE JUST MADE ONE FOR TRAVIS SCOTT. MICHELE AND I HAVE THAT BED HERE IN PARIS. BUT THEN I DID MY FIRST SHOW IN NEW YORK AND I GOT A DISTRIBUTOR AND A MANUFACTURER IN ITALY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAD MONEY. I WASN’T RICH, BUT IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY, A LOT MORE MONEY THAN I’D BEEN MAKING FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. AND THE FIRST THING THAT MICHELE AND I GOT WAS A LINCOLN TOWN CAR BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS CELEBRITY CAR RENTAL PLACE THAT WOULD DELIVER A FRESH LINCOLN TOWN CAR EVERY TWO WEEKS, AND TAKE THE OLD ONE BACK. SO THERE WAS LIKE A FRESH NEW LINCOLN TOWN CAR IN THE PARKING LOT ACROSS THE STREET EVERY TWO WEEKS. SO I GOT THAT AND A BLACK BABY GRAND PIANO FOR THE MAIN ROOM. AND NEITHER OF US PLAY THE PIANO. (LAUGHS) BUT IT WAS JUST THE VISION OF THAT SHINY BLACK PIANO IN THE ROOM AND THE SHINY BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR ACROSS THE STREET IN THE PARKING LOT. THAT WAS A MOMENT. YOU HAVE TO PUT THOSE IN A SHOW ONE DAY, THE LINCOLN TOWN CAR AND THE PIANO. YOU’RE RIGHT. I ABSOLUTELY SHOULD… I HADN’T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE. THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME ABOUT THEM. IT PUTS ME IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD. I CAN SEE THEM BOTH SUSPENDED BY CRANES OUTSIDE THE PALAIS DE TOKYO THIS SUMMER. YEAH, RIGHT. THAT’D BE FUCKING SICK. WITH SMOKE MACHINES GOING OFF UNDERNEATH. DON’T WORRY ABOUT THE SMOKE. THAT’LL BE THERE. BELIEVE ME.

THE RARE ARTIST WHOLLY COMMITTED TO HIS AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES, HE “HATED THE INFORMAL AND SUBURBAN ETHOS OF SNEAKERS.” IN 2021, WHEN OWENS BEGAN COLLABORATING WITH CONVERSE, HE “CORRUPTED” THE CHUCK 70: SQUARED THE TOE, ELONGATED THE TONGUE, DOUBLED THE SOLE. OWENS—A CALIFORNIA KID WHO WAS RAISED CATHOLIC BUT GRAVITATED TOWARDS SEX CLUBS, THE RAMONES, AND THE GERMAN ARTIST JOSEPH BEUYS—OFTEN TALKS ABOUT CORRUPTION. HE STARTED HIS BRAND IN 1994 TO “CORRUPT CONFORMITY FROM WITHIN.” LOOK AT HIS FASHION SHOWS: HE’S SENT MALE MODELS DOWN THE RUNWAY IN PENIS-BARING TUNICS AND PHYSICALLY STRAPPED MODELS ONTO THE BACKS OF SLIGHTLY STRONGER MODELS. ON SEPTEMBER 28, HE WILL SHOW HIS SPRING-SUMMER WOMEN’S COLLECTION IN PARIS. FOR AN OVERVIEW OF OWENS’S ETHOS, RIZZOLI JUST PUBLISHED A NEW MONOGRAPH ON HIS WORK. OWENS FLIES WHEN DUTY CALLS. HERE, HE ANSWERS OUR QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT WHAT HE PACKS, EATS, AND BUYS WHILE TRAVELING. LAST FLIGHT YOU TOOK? PARIS TO VENICE 2 DAYS AGO- I DON&#39;T REALLY FLY THAT MUCH, MAINLY PARIS TO VENICE IN THE SUMMER AND PARIS TO LUXOR IN THE WINTER. AND IN BETWEEN, PARIS TO BOLOGNA WHERE MY FACTORY IS. I CIRCULATE A LOT LESS THAN I USED TO, WHICH WAS NEVER ALL THAT MUCH TO BEGIN WITH. I HAVE ENDED UP LIVING IN SUCH SPECIAL PLACES, I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD ENJOY THEM CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY BEFORE JUST CONSUMING EXPERIENCES IN VOLUME. FAVORITE AIRLINE? I CAN’T REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE. AIRPORTS AND AIRPLANES ARE ALL GONNA BE A NECESSARY COMPROMISE. WHAT DO YOU WEAR TO THE AIRPORT? WHAT I ALWAYS WEAR WHEN I GO OUT MY FRONT DOOR- BIG SHOULDERS, TITS OUT T-SHIRT AND HIGH HEELS. WHEN I DECIDE ON A NEW LOOK EVERY FEW YEARS, I STICK TO IT. TENACIOUSLY AND TEDIOUSLY. AND I SOMETIMES TRY TO WEAR SUNGLASSES BUT ALWAYS END UP FEELING LIKE A BIGGER DOUCHE THAN I ALREADY AM. HOW LONG BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT BOARDS DO YOU GET TO THE AIRPORT? AN HOUR SO I CAN DEAL WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS LEISURELY. CHECK BAGS, OR CARRY ON ONLY? CARRY-ON ONLY WHAT DO YOU BRING IN YOUR CARRY ON? LAPTOP, SWEATER, BOOK TSA PRE-CHECK, OR REGULAR? IS THAT A U.S. THING? I DON&#39;T TRAVEL THERE…. FAVORITE AIRPORT? MY MAIN EXPERIENCE IS CDG AND I DO HAVE TO SAY IT’S SEXY AF- ALL MOODY CONCRETE AND SPOOKY LIGHTING AT NIGHT…. SOUNDTRACKED TO MASS PRODUCTION BY IGGY POP ON MY EARBUDS. WHAT DO YOU BUY IN THE AIRPORT TERMINAL? I REGRET THAT THE MAGAZINE STANDS HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE REDUCED- I’LL GET AD FR AND WORLD OF INTERIORS IF THEY HAVE THEM WHICH THEY NOW SELDOM SEEM TO…. WHAT DO YOU DO WHILE WAITING TO BOARD? READ AND PEOPLE-WATCH, ENJOYING THE ENERGY OF BEING IN A CROWD FULL OF ANTICIPATION, LIKE BEFORE A CONCERT IN A STADIUM. ITEM YOU CAN’T FLY WITHOUT? FRISK MINTS. DO YOU TAKE ANY DRUGS/DRINK TO FLY? IF I HAVE A LONG FLIGHT WHICH IS VERY VERY RARE, I TAKE AN OVER-THE-COUNTER SLEEPING PILL. FIRST CLASS OR COACH? BUSINESS WINDOW, MIDDLE, OR AISLE SEAT? WINDOW. I STILL MARVEL AT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE WORLD FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. MOVIES/ TV, READING, SLEEPING, OR WORKING ON A PLANE? READING. USUALLY BIOS- THE LAST ONE WAS A BOOK ON PETER BEARD BY MY OLD FRIEND CHRIS WALLACE. A DELICIOUSLY PERCEPTIVE BOOK AS MUCH ABOUT CHRIS AS IT WAS ABOUT BEARD. DO YOU BUY WI-FI? NO- FLIGHTS ARE A GREAT PLACE TO LET MY MIND WANDER- I LOOK FORWARD TO SUBMITTING TO THE SENSE OF LOCOMOTION AND SPEED AND MOMENTUM TO RELEASE MY BRAIN WHICH IT INVARIABLY DOES. I COME UP WITH SOME OF MY BEST IDEAS ON PLANES OR IN CARS…... DO YOU EAT PLANE FOOD? NO. BEST DRINK TO GET ON A FLIGHT? I DON’T. DO YOU TALK TO THE PEOPLE SITTING NEXT TO YOU? I ALWAYS SAY HELLO BUT KEEP TO MYSELF. KEEP SHOES ON OR OFF ON THE PLANE? ON. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN TURBULENCE HITS? I EQUATE IT TO A SPEEDBOAT ON WAVES. WORST PART OF THE FLIGHT? BEING ASSAULTED BY THE VERY NARROW AND SMUG ASPIRATIONAL AESTHETICS OF THE BEAUTY MALL WE ARE ALL HERDED THROUGH. FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN THE PLANE LANDS? CHECK PHONE TO SEE IF MY LOVED ONES NEED ME. ADVICE FOR TRAVELERS? MAYBE WEAR SOCKS AND SHOES.

WHEN MARC JACOBS CALLS AT THE END OF JUNE, IT’S BEEN FOUR DAYS SINCE HIS FALL 2023 SHOW AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY, ON FIFTH AVENUE IN MANHATTAN. PEOPLE WERE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE PRESENTATION WAS OFF-CALENDAR, BARE-BONES, AND FAR MORE INTIMATE THAN THE GRAND THEATRICAL SPECTACLES JACOBS ONCE PRODUCED. A LOT HAS CHANGED FOR THE DESIGNER SINCE HE DID AWAY WITH HIS JAW-DROPPING SETS AND SCALED BACK HIS COLLECTIONS, WHICH ARE NOW SOLD IN A SINGLE STORE, BERGDORF GOODMAN. BUT AUDIENCES STILL LOOK TO JACOBS FOR DIRECTION, AND HE DELIVERS—PROVOCATIVELY, AS USUAL. THIS TIME, HE PRESENTED THE COLLECTION ONLY AS A FINALE: THE MODELS MARCHED UP AND DOWN THE RUNWAY IN A LINE AS THEY WOULD HAVE AT THE END OF A SHOW, WITHOUT FIRST COMING OUT INDIVIDUALLY, WHICH BARELY GAVE THE AUDIENCE A CHANCE TO SEE THE CLOTHES. THE WHOLE THING TOOK APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES. WHAT’S MORE, HIS NORMALLY INFORMATIVE PROGRAM NOTES WERE THIS TIME COMPOSED BY CHATGPT, THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BOT THAT CHURNS OUT BANAL, COMPUTER-GENERATED COPY ON DEMAND, AS IF JACOBS WERE MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT THE STEADY DEVALUATION OF THE CREATIVE CLASS IN THE WAKE OF ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY. OR MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT THE RELENTLESS SPEED OF TODAY’S FASHION INDUSTRY, OR JUST THE GENERAL CLIMATE OF INSTANT GRATIFICATION AND NONEXISTENT ATTENTION SPANS: THE MARC JACOBS FASHION SHOW, THE TEXT READ, WAS “A STRIKING FUSION OF MASCULINE TAILORING AND FEMININE ELEGANCE.” NATURALLY, PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT JACOBS WAS UP TO, BUT THE DESIGNER HAD SPED OFF IN HIS LAMBORGHINI HURACÁN BEFORE ANYONE HAD THE CHANCE TO ASK. HAVING WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY FOR SOME 40 YEARS, HAVING SEEN CONVERSATIONS SHIFT FROM THE DOMINANCE OF BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES TO THE PERILS OF ONLINE RETAILING AND AI, JACOBS SPEAKS, WHEN WE CONNECT, WITHOUT A HINT OF DISDAIN FOR THE MODERN WORLD. WHATEVER CRITICS MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT HIS SHOW, HE WANTED TO BE CLEAR HE WAS NOT MAKING LIGHT OF ANYTHING. HE REMEMBERS THAT THIS PAST SUMMER, WHEN HE COULDN’T FIND THE RIGHT WORDS TO DESCRIBE HIS WORK, IT WAS HIS ASSISTANT NICK NEWBOLD WHO SUGGESTED THEY TRY CHATGPT. JACOBS LOVED THE IDEA—EVEN THOUGH IT FELT A LITTLE DANGEROUS. “I THINK IN A POSITIVE WAY, IT WAS THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL OF THIS HISTORY I’VE HAD, AND ALL OF THE WAYS WE USED TO DO THINGS, COMING TOGETHER AND SAYING, ‘WELL, THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS CREATIVE PROCESS. YOU HAVE MADE A DECISION TO HAVE THIS BE THE PROGRAM NOTES,’ ” SAYS JACOBS. “SO EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN’T FEEL LIKE A CREATIVE DECISION AT THE TIME, IT WAS A CREATIVE DECISION.” JACOBS TURNED 60 THIS YEAR. HIS BRILLIANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS ABILITY TO TUNE INTO A MOMENT AND DEFINE IT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE, AND TO FIND INSPIRATION IN LIFE’S IMPERFECTIONS. FOR HIM AND OTHER DESIGNERS WHO MANAGED TO CREATE SOMETHING MARVELOUS AND TANGIBLE IN THEIR LIFETIMES—THAT IS, A REAL BRAND WITH STAYING POWER, WITH THEIR NAME ON THE DOOR—IT BECOMES A NECESSITY TO CONSTANTLY QUESTION THEMSELVES. THESE ARE NOT JUST THE SURVIVORS OF A CAREER AMID FASHION’S ENDLESS THRUSTS AND PARRIES. THEY ARE THE CONQUERORS. LOOKING AT THOSE WHO HAVE REMAINED AT THE HELM OF THEIR OWN LABELS FOR DECADES, IT’S HARD TO DESCRIBE HOW PHENOMENALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT GOAL MUST HAVE LOOKED WHEN THEY WERE STARTING OUT. JACOBS WAS FAMOUSLY FIRED FROM HIS FIRST JOB, AT PERRY ELLIS, FOLLOWING HIS GRUNGE COLLECTION IN 1992, BUT HIS GROUNDBREAKING WORK FOR LOUIS VUITTON ESTABLISHED A NEW ARCHETYPE: THE MULTITASKING, GLOBE-TROTTING, INSANELY RICH DESIGNER. LOOK AT MICHAEL KORS, WHO HAD TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN 1993 AFTER A DECADE IN BUSINESS BUT WENT ON TO BECOME AN INTERNATIONAL POWERHOUSE AFTER WORKING FOR CÉLINE IN PARIS AND ICB IN TOKYO. HIS OWN COMPANY WENT PUBLIC IN 2011, AND KORS, 64, IS NOW A BILLIONAIRE. THESE ARE FEATS TO BE CELEBRATED FOR THE SHEER AUDACITY IT TOOK FOR THE DESIGNERS TO BELIEVE IN THEIR OWN TALENT—AND TO BE PROVEN CORRECT. “I THINK MY STAYING POWER CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MY DETERMINATION AND STRONG WILL,” SAYS GIORGIO ARMANI, WHO, AT 89, IS EASILY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT DESIGNER IN THE HISTORY OF ITALIAN FASHION, WITH A NET WORTH OF $12.7 BILLION, ACCORDING TO FORBES. “I LEARNED VERY EARLY ON THAT WHILE OTHER PEOPLE’S OPINIONS DO MATTER, WHAT TRULY COUNTS IS STAYING TRUE TO MY VISION.” OTHERS, LIKE MIUCCIA PRADA, 74, AND DONATELLA VERSACE, 68, HAVE MOLDED FAMILY BUSINESSES INTO ESTABLISHMENT BRANDS WITH ENORMOUS CLOUT AND REVENUES, AND EASILY DEFINABLE LEGACIES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO RESONATE LONG AFTER THEY ARE GONE. AFTER 42 YEARS IN BUSINESS, KORS CAN’T SAY HE’S SURPRISED TO HAVE SUCCEEDED DOING A JOB THAT HE LOVES. HE STILL THINKS OF HIMSELF AS THAT KID FROM LONG ISLAND WHO STARTED SELLING FASHION SKETCHES WHEN HE WAS JUST 16. HE ONCE TOLD THE ACTOR MELANIE GRIFFITH THAT HE IDENTIFIES WITH HER CHARACTER TESS MCGILL, IN WORKING GIRL—HE’S JUST A WORKING GUY FROM THE OUTER BOROUGHS WITH AN ENDLESS DRIVE TO SUCCEED IN THE BIG CITY. “WHAT SURPRISES ME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IS THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON’T EVEN REALIZE THAT THERE IS A PERSON NAMED MICHAEL KORS WHO STILL GOES TO WORK EVERY DAY, WHO STILL DESIGNS THE PRODUCT,” HE TELLS ME. “I’VE HAD TSA PEOPLE SEE MY NAME AND ASK, ‘HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED AT MICHAEL KORS?’ ” WHEN KORS, WHO IS KNOWN FOR HIS JET-SET VISION OF AMERICAN SPORTSWEAR, WON THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA IN 2010, AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 50, HE BECAME ONE OF THE YOUNGEST DESIGNERS EVER TO RECEIVE SUCH AN ACCOLADE. JACOBS WAS GIVEN THE SAME AWARD THE FOLLOWING YEAR, AT 48, AND IT OCCURRED TO KORS THAT SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL HAD CHANGED IN THE FASHION WORLD THAT HE HAD KNOWN SINCE HIS YOUTH: HIS GENERATION HAD BECOME THE ESTABLISHMENT, AND THERE WEREN’T MANY DESIGNERS STILL AROUND WHO COULD SAY THEY HAD MADE IT THAT FAR. “IN MY MIND, WE HAD BEEN CALLED ‘YOUNG DESIGNERS’ FOR SO LONG THAT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WE WERE YOUNG DESIGNERS FOREVER,” SAYS KORS. “WHEN MARC GOT HIS AWARD, I LOOKED AT HIM AND I SAID, ‘I GUESS WE’RE THE OLD YOUNG DESIGNERS NOW.’ ” WHY DID THEY LAST WHEN OTHERS DID NOT? MANY ICONIC DESIGNERS HAVE HAD FULL, CELEBRATED CAREERS AND CHOSEN STRATEGIC AND HUGELY PROFITABLE EXITS, SELLING THEIR LABELS TO BIG CORPORATIONS AND MOVING ON TO THEIR NEXT LIVES—THINK OF DONNA KARAN AND HER ZEN WANDERINGS, CALVIN KLEIN SPENDING YEARS DESIGNING HIS MINIMALIST MANSIONS, AND NOW TOM FORD, WHO STRUCK A DEAL WITH ESTÉE LAUDER FOR $2.8 BILLION LAST NOVEMBER AND PLANS TO GO BACK TO DIRECTING MOVIES IN HOLLYWOOD. BUT FOR THE MAJORITY, FASHION IS A TOUGH GAME, LITTERED WITH EXAMPLES OF DESIGNERS WHO SAW THEIR PROMISING CAREERS CRASH AND BURN, AND OTHERS WHO HEADED FOR THE DOOR RATHER THAN BEND THEIR VISION TO THE WILL OF A NEW OWNER. THERE’S NO ESCAPING THE SENSE THAT IT’S ALSO BECOMING HARDER FOR NEWCOMERS TO HOLD ON TO LUCRATIVE JOBS AT LUXURY HOUSES AS THE MERRY-GO-ROUND SEEMS TO SPIN EVER FASTER. PART OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE CONTINUALLY EXPANDING JOB DESCRIPTION OF A DESIGNER, WHOSE DUTIES HAVE ALWAYS REQUIRED AN INTENSE BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE PROCESS OF CREATION AND THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS IN A BUSINESS—AS WELL AS A WILLINGNESS TO ADAPT TO THE TIMES. “I’M NOT JUST A FASHION DESIGNER,” SAYS KORS. “I’M IN MEDIA. I NEVER KNEW THAT THE WORD ‘CONTENT’ WOULD BE SOMETHING A DESIGNER WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT.” NOW EVERY COLLECTION IS CRAFTED WITH A NARRATIVE THAT UNFOLDS OVER THE COURSE OF A SEASON, WITH ELEMENTS DIRECTED TO AUDIENCES WHEREVER THEY ARE CONSUMING FASHION—BE IT IN A STORE, ONLINE, OR ON SOCIAL PLATFORMS. “REMEMBER,” SAYS DONATELLA VERSACE, THE UNDISPUTED QUEEN OF CREATING VIRAL MOMENTS, “THAT GOOGLE INVENTED GOOGLE IMAGES BECAUSE OF JENNIFER LOPEZ WEARING THE VERSACE JUNGLE-PRINT DRESS. I HAVE SEEN MYSELF DESIGNED AS AN AVATAR, AND I HAVE SEEN SOME EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN AI. I LIKE TO SURPRISE PEOPLE—I AM INSPIRED BY TECHNOLOGY AND CREATIVITY WORKING TOGETHER.” TORY BURCH, WHO FOUNDED HER LABEL IN 2004, WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO EMPHASIZE A PRIMARILY DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER MODEL, WITH BOTH E-COMMERCE AND ONLINE CONTENT CHANNELS. WHAT SOUNDS NORMAL TODAY WAS CONSIDERED WILDLY DISRUPTIVE AT THE TIME. “PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT I WAS CRAZY, AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY STRANGE THAT I INCLUDED OTHER DESIGNERS’ WORK ON OUR WEBSITE WITH ‘TORY DAILY,’ WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST FASHION BLOGS,” SAYS BURCH. TODAY, BURCH HAS 4,500 EMPLOYEES; IN THE HEAD OFFICE, 80 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN. UNLIKE MOST DESIGNERS WHO CREATE A PHILANTHROPIC FOUNDATION ONCE THEY ARE ESTABLISHED, BURCH FLIPPED THE SCRIPT AND STARTED A FASHION LINE TO SUPPORT HER PHILANTHROPY: HER FOUNDATION HAS AWARDED MORE THAN $100 MILLION IN LOW-INTEREST LOANS TO FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS IN THE UNITED STATES. “THAT WAS MY BUSINESS PLAN, LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT POSITIVE CHANGE, AND I DIDN’T HAVE EXPERIENCE IN ANY OF THE ABOVE,” BURCH RECALLS. “I’M SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED HEARING MYSELF SAY THOSE WORDS AFTER 18 YEARS, NOW KNOWING WHAT THAT MEANS AND THE AMOUNT OF EXCRUCIATINGLY HARD WORK THAT UNFOLDED.” TWO THINGS STAND OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME. FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANT, EACH DESIGNER HAS A DISTINCT POINT OF VIEW AND A UNIQUE STORY TO TELL THROUGH THEIR CLOTHES, THEIR LIFESTYLE, AND EVEN THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE. JACOBS IS THE CREATIVE RINGMASTER OF AMERICAN FASHION. TORY BURCH SELLS ACCESSIBLE LUXURY AND PRIORITIZES HAVING COMMUNITY IMPACT. RICK OWENS PRACTICALLY OWNS THE CONCEPT OF GOTHIC AVANT-GARDE. STELLA MCCARTNEY’S ETHOS REVOLVES AROUND CRUELTY-FREE CLOTHING AND INNOVATIVE MATERIALS SUCH AS VEGETARIAN LEATHER. GIORGIO ARMANI IS KNOWN AS THE FIRST TO CAPITALIZE ON THE POWER OF THE RED CARPET—HAS ANY OSCAR WINNER NOT WORN ONE OF HIS CREATIONS AT SOME POINT? DONATELLA VERSACE IS FAMOUS FOR BEING DONATELLA VERSACE—ONCE AN OVER-THE-TOP DIVA WHO EPITOMIZED THE LABEL’S FIERCE BODY-CON GLAMAZON AESTHETIC, NOW A DISTINGUISHED ROLE MODEL FOR THE MODERN FEMALE CEO. FROM THE TIME SHE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN, MIUCCIA PRADA’S FASHION PHILOSOPHY WAS BUILT ALMOST ENTIRELY ON HER OWN RESISTANCE TO ANYONE TELLING HER WHAT SHE SHOULD DO OR HOW SHE SHOULD DRESS. SHE WORE SAINT LAURENT TO WOMEN’S LIBERATION PROTESTS AND HAS BEEN A CONTRARIAN EVER SINCE. “I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO A PARTY AND ALSO TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AND NEVER BE ASHAMED OF WHAT YOU ARE WEARING,” SAYS PRADA. “I DON’T WANT TO HAVE TO DRESS DIFFERENTLY FOR DIFFERENT SOCIAL PLANS. I WOULD HAVE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE IF I WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY WAY OF DRESSING FOR WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO.” KORS, DESPITE HIS SELF-DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR, REALLY DOES PROJECT THE GLAMOROUS IMAGE OF A JET-SETTER IN HIS AVIATOR SUNGLASSES AND PERFECT SUNTAN. HE BECAME A HOUSEHOLD NAME WHEN HE APPEARED AS A JUDGE ON PROJECT RUNWAY FOR 10 SEASONS, BEGINNING IN 2004, AND WAS INDELIBLE IN VIEWERS’ MINDS FOR HIS CRAFTY QUIPS. “OF COURSE, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, SO THERE’S A WHOLE NEW GENERATION WHO DIDN’T WATCH PROJECT RUNWAY, AND THEY ONLY KNOW THE PRODUCT,” SAYS KORS. “BUT DOES IT HELP TO HAVE CONFIDENCE? TO HAVE A PERSONALITY? WELL, IT DOESN’T HURT TO BE STYLISH.” THE SECOND THING THESE DESIGNERS HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY HAVE ALL TRIUMPHED OVER ADVERSITY, WHETHER IT BE SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR FINANCIAL CALAMITIES OR THE LOSS OF A CHERISHED PARTNER, AND DONE SO WHILE CONSTANTLY IN THE PUBLIC EYE. VERSACE REMEMBERS THE LEARNING CURVE SHE FACED WHEN EVERYONE QUESTIONED HER ABILITY TO STEER THE LABEL AFTER THE 1997 ASSASSINATION OF HER BROTHER GIANNI. “IT PROBABLY WAS HARDER ON ME BECAUSE I AM A VERSACE, AND THE MAGNIFYING GLASS WAS STRONG,” SHE SAYS. “NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN LEADING THE COMPANY FOR LONGER THAN MY BROTHER, AND BROUGHT IN NEW BUSINESS PARTNERS SO SUCCESSFULLY, HOPEFULLY THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ANSWERED.” SHE WASN’T CONFIDENT IN HERSELF THEN, BUT SHE IS NOW. STILL, THERE IS NO BLUEPRINT FOR HOW TO GET AHEAD IN FASHION WITHOUT REALLY, REALLY TRYING. FOR MOST DESIGNERS, SUCCESS HAD TO DO WITH DRIVE, TALENT, AND BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND THE 1990S WERE ONE OF THE BEST TIMES TO BE STARTING OUT IN FASHION; THE DECADE SAW A FABULOUS EXPLOSION OF FIN DE SIÈCLE CREATIVITY BANKROLLED BY TYCOONS WHO WERE IN A RACE TO BUILD WHAT WOULD BECOME TODAY’S MASSIVE LUXURY CONGLOMERATES. BOTH JACOBS AND KORS BENEFITED FROM THEIR LONG ASSOCIATIONS WITH LVMH, WHILE STELLA MCCARTNEY WAS SNAPPED UP BY WHAT WAS THEN KNOWN AS GUCCI GROUP. “WE WERE PART OF THIS REALLY YOUNG, NAIVE, KIND OF REBELLIOUS MOMENT WHEN PEOPLE FELT THEY HAD PERMISSION TO START THEIR OWN BRANDS,” SAYS MCCARTNEY, WHO WAS FRESH OUT OF CENTRAL SAINT MARTINS AND HAD STARTED A FLEDGLING BUSINESS BASED ON HER GRADUATION COLLECTION OF VINTAGE LACE DRESSES WHEN SHE WAS SUDDENLY HIRED AS CHLOÉ’S YOUNGEST-EVER CREATIVE DIRECTOR, IN 1997. “IT WAS SUCH A RARE PERIOD IN FASHION. I DON’T KNOW IF THAT STUFF HAPPENS ANYMORE SO NATURALLY AND ORGANICALLY AND EFFORTLESSLY.” BY 2001, SHE WAS BEING COURTED BY TOM FORD AND HIS BUSINESS COUNTERPART, DOMENICO DE SOLE, TO TAKE OVER GUCCI. “TOM SAID THEY WOULD STOP DOING FUR, AND I SAID, ‘THAT’S GREAT, BUT ARE YOU AWARE THAT I DON’T DO LEATHER, EITHER?’ AND HIS FACE DROPPED, AND THE BLOOD WAS DRAINED,” SAYS MCCARTNEY, WHO IS NOW 51. “THAT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE ASK ON MY SIDE AT THE TIME, AND I WAS SO HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO GO THERE. A WEEK LATER, HE CALLED ME UP AND SAID, ‘LOOK, I’VE TALKED TO DOMENICO. DO YOU WANT TO START YOUR OWN LABEL WITH US?’ I WAS LIKE, ‘HELL, YEAH!’ ” (GUCCI GROUP WAS LATER RENAMED KERING; IN 2018, MCCARTNEY TOOK BACK CONTROL OF HER LABEL AND THEN ALIGNED WITH LVMH.) RICK OWENS BEGAN SELLING HIS DARK, UNCONVENTIONAL, AND DECISIVELY INDEPENDENT DESIGNS OUT OF LOS ANGELES IN 1994 THROUGH THE GROUNDBREAKING RETAILER CHARLES GALLAY. HE FOUND HIMSELF FACING A QUANDARY WHEN VOGUE SPONSORED HIS FIRST RUNWAY SHOW IN 2001, SUDDENLY MAKING HIM THE TOAST OF FASHION. “I REALLY WASN’T CONFIDENT THAT MY VERY SLOW, QUIET LITTLE AESTHETIC WOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE GLARE OF THE RUNWAY SPOTLIGHT FOR VERY LONG,” SAYS OWENS, WHO IS NOW 60. “I MEAN, I COULD DO ONE OR TWO SHOWS, BUT AFTER THAT I WASN’T GOING TO CHANGE ENOUGH TO SATISFY PEOPLE WHO NEEDED MORE EXCITEMENT FOR THE WHOLE FASHION SCENARIO. I SUSPECTED THAT I WAS GOING TO BECOME THE FASHION WEEK WEIRDO AFTER A WHILE.” THE FOLLOWING YEAR, HE WAS ASKED TO BECOME THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF REVILLON, A FUR HOUSE SO OLD THAT IT’S MENTIONED BY PROUST; IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE THAT GAVE HIM VALIDATION IN PARIS AND THE CONFIDENCE TO BUILD HIS LIFE THERE. OVER TIME, HE HAS COME TO ENJOY EVERY PART OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS—EVEN THE SHOWS, WHICH NOW INCLUDE PYROTECHNICS AND FOG MACHINES. “YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOUR RELEVANCE FOUR TIMES A YEAR,” HE SAYS, REFERENCING HIS MEN’S AND WOMEN’S COLLECTIONS. “BUT IT’S KIND OF LIKE A BIRTHDAY PARTY. YOU’VE FULFILLED A CYCLE AND A CIRCLE, SO IT’S A PAGAN CEREMONY WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT I LIKE.” THAT’S WHAT’S GREAT ABOUT DESIGNERS STICKING AROUND FOR SO LONG—ALL THE THINGS THAT USED TO FRUSTRATE THEM HAVE BECOME THINGS THEY LOVE. AT THE TIME WE SPEAK, BURCH, 57, IS IN PARIS AND LEAVING THE NEXT DAY FOR HER MUCH-DELAYED SAFARI HONEYMOON IN AFRICA. IT’S BEEN SO LONG SINCE SHE TOOK A VACATION THAT SHE CAN’T REMEMBER WHEN IT LAST OCCURRED TO HER TO EVEN WANT ONE. SHE MARRIED PIERRE-YVES ROUSSEL, THE FORMER LVMH CHAIRMAN AND CEO WHO IS NOW CEO OF HER BUSINESS, IN 2018. SINCE ROUSSEL JOINED THE COMPANY, SHE’S BEEN DELIGHTED TO FOCUS ON DESIGN. AND, LIKE ANY GREAT DESIGNER, SHE HAS HER EYE ON THE FUTURE. “I’VE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE, ‘HOW DO WE BUILD A COMPANY THAT HAS STAYING POWER AND THAT IS HERE BEYOND ME?’ ” SAYS BURCH. “THAT’S SOMETHING I’M VERY INTERESTED IN.” ONE IDEA WOULD BE TO LOOK AT ARMANI’S EXAMPLE. HE HAS FIERCELY MAINTAINED CONTROL OF HIS EMPIRE WHILE JUGGLING THE DUAL ROLES OF DESIGNER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE FOR MUCH OF HIS CAREER. IT WAS THE DEATH, IN 1985, OF HIS FOUNDING PARTNER, SERGIO GALEOTTI, THE YOUNG ARCHITECT WHO SWEPT ARMANI OFF HIS FEET AND PERSUADED HIM TO STRIKE OUT ON HIS OWN, THAT FORCED ARMANI TO BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR. HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF LUCKY NOW, HAVING SO MANY DEDICATED FAMILY MEMBERS STILL WORKING FOR THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ROBERTA AND SILVANA ARMANI, THE DAUGHTERS OF HIS LATE BROTHER, SERGIO, AND ANDREA CAMERANA, THE SON OF HIS SISTER, ROSANNA. “I HAVE ALWAYS WORKED THIS WAY, STAUNCHLY DEFENDING MY INDEPENDENCE, BECAUSE I AM CONVINCED THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO CREATE SOMETHING RELEVANT,” SAYS ARMANI. “THE PARADOX OF INDEPENDENCE HAS CERTAINLY CREATED A RATHER UNIQUE REALITY IN TODAY’S FASHION LANDSCAPE. I AM A BLACK SWAN IN A WORLD OF VERY POWERFUL CONGLOMERATES.” EVEN AFTER SO MANY YEARS, FOR ALL THESE DESIGNERS, THE ROAD AHEAD WILL BE FULL OF UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS—BUT THEY WANT TO ENJOY THE RIDE FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN. WHAT MATTERS TO THEM IS TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. “I DON’T BELIEVE THAT I’VE EVER MADE A PERFECT COLLECTION—I ALWAYS FIND FAULT AND I ALWAYS THINK WE COULD DO BETTER,” SAYS JACOBS. “THAT’S WHY IT’S GREAT THAT WE CONSTANTLY GET THE CHANCE TO DO ANOTHER ONE. SUCCESS, TO ME, ISN’T A FINAL THING. I’M NOT SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE I’VE DONE SOMETHING—I’M SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE I KEEP GETTING TO DO THAT THING.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

SINCE THIS FIRST COLLABORATION, LEVITT HAS BECOME OWENS’ UNOFFICIAL “ARCHIVIST”, DOCUMENTING EACH COLLECTION, AND THE DESIGNER’S EVOLUTION, WITH HER “CLEAR-EYED HONESTY AND TENDERNESS.” TO MARK THE RELEASE OF THE NEW BOOK, OWENS AND LEVITT (JOINED BRIEFLY BY OWENS’ WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY) SAT DOWN TO CHAT AND REMINISCE ON HOW THEY FIRST MET, AND HOW THEIR RELATIONSHIP HAS GROWN SINCE. DANIELLE LEVITT: I REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW WE MET – CHRIS WALLACE INTRODUCED US. WELL, HE INTRODUCED ME TO MICHÈLE, AS SHE WANTED TO DO A PROJECT DOCUMENTING THE FURNITURE. SO, I CAME TO PARIS AND MET MICHÈLE. AND THEN SHE INVITED ME TO MAKE THIS FILM FOR ANOTHER ACTUALLY. I WAS WITH YOU TWO FOR THE WEEK. AND I REMEMBER YOU SAID, “OH, SHE’S CUTE.” THEN AFTER THAT, YOU KIND OF IGNORED ME FOR THE FIRST THREE DAYS. [LAUGHS]. RICK OWENS: BUT I LIKED THE OUTCOME OF THE DOCUMENTARY AND THOUGHT, “OH, WHAT A GOOD IDEA. WHY DON’T I MAKE A DOCUMENTARY FOR MY NEXT SHOW?” SINCE I’M DOING THIS PROJECT DOCUMENTING STEP TEAMS COMING FROM NEW JERSEY, WASHINGTON, AND NEW YORK. DL: YOU ASKED ME TO DO THE DOCUMENTARY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TAKE IMAGES OF THE GIRLS AT THE SHOW. I SET UP A PHOTOBOOTH BACKSTAGE AND SHOT ALL THESE INCREDIBLE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE GIRLS IN THEIR TRUE POWER. I DON’T THINK PRIOR YOU’D DOCUMENTED ANY OF YOUR SHOWS IN THAT FORMAL WAY. AND I SHOOT DIFFERENTLY TO HOW YOU THINK PEOPLE SEE YOU. YOU KNOW, I’M BRIGHT AND IT’S ON WHITE. BUT THEN YOU WERE LIKE, “OH, THIS IS INTERESTING. DANIELLE, WILL YOU COME AND DOCUMENT THE NEXT ONE?” SO NOW WE’VE BEEN DOING THIS FOUR TIMES A YEAR EVER SINCE. BUT I REMEMBER AT THE BEGINNING, I’D ALWAYS SAY, “OH RICK, SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT!” AND YOU WERE LIKE, “NO DOLL. WE DON’T NEED TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT.” RO: BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN CONSISTENCY. I THINK WHAT MAKES SOMETHING POWERFUL IS REPETITION AND CONFIDENCE IN STICKING TO A CERTAIN THING. NOT HAVING TO TWEAK IT OR NOT HAVING TO DECORATE IT OR FUSS WITH IT. IF IT’S STRONG IT’S STRONG, AND IT’LL WORK AND THAT’S WHAT MAKES THIS BODY OF WORK SIGNIFICANT. THE FACT THAT IT IS VERY STEADY AND STEADFAST. DL: AND YOU ARE CORRECT. I LOOK BACK AT THIS WORK NOW AND HAD I CHANGED LIGHTING FROM SEASON TO SEASON, IT WOULDN’T HAVE THE POWER IT DOES. IT ALLOWS YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’VE DONE AND SEE THE EVOLUTION SO CLEARLY BECAUSE YOU’RE NOT DISTRACTED BY ANYTHING. IT’S THE REASON I CALL MYSELF AN ARCHIVIST BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE ARCHIVING YOUR CHOICES, RIGHT? MY STAMP IS JUST LIKE THE CLEAREST WAY TO SEE WHAT YOU DO. RO: BUT IT’S ALSO CAPTURING CERTAIN GESTURES AND YOU PULL THINGS OUT OF PEOPLE IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY. THAT’S ALL YOU. I MEAN, THERE’S AN ALCHEMY HAPPENING THERE. DL: I HAVE A PARTICULAR STYLE ON SET THAT MIGHT NOT BE THAT COMMON. [LAUGHS]. I SCREAM AND I DANCE AND I TWIRL AROUND. NOW THAT A LOT OF THE MODELS KNOW ME – BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS USE THE SAME MODELS – THEY LOVE IT, THEY LOVE THE ENERGY. EVERYBODY’S EXCITED TO BE THERE. IT’S LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A DANCE PARTY AFTER THE SHOW. RO: AND WE HAVE BRUTALISMUS 3000 PLAYING FULL BLAST. WHAT I LIKE IN OUR WORK TOGETHER IS THAT IT MAKES SENSE. AS A CREATURE OF HABIT, I LIKE THINGS VERY CONSISTENT. ALSO, I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU REPEAT SOMETHING OFTEN ENOUGH, IT BECOMES TRUE. DL: AGREED, AGREED. RO: THAT’S A BIG PART OF MY SHTICK. I ALWAYS WONDER WHEN THE DAY WILL COME WHERE I GET THAT BALANCE WRONG. I’VE SEEN IT HAPPEN IN THE WORLD AND IT KIND OF FREAKS ME OUT. BUT IT’S A TRICKY LITTLE BALANCE, LIKE, ARE YOU BEING REPETITIVE AND LAZY? OR ARE YOU BEING CONSISTENT AND SOLID? AND YOU REALLY JUST HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON IT. DL: I WILL INTERJECT. RICK, YOU’RE THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE DO TOGETHER. BUT THE OTHER THING IS, I WENT LAST YEAR WITH MICHÈLE LAMY TO SEE HER DAUGHTER AND THEIR KIDS. MICHÈLE WANTED TO TAKE A PHOTO SHOOT IN A CEMETERY THAT HAD TOPIARIES. MY HUSBAND SAID, “DANIELLE, YOU’RE LIKE ANNIE LEIBOVITZ. THE WAY THAT ANNIE LEIBOVITZ WAS TO THE ROLLING STONES, YOU ARE TO RICK AND MICHÈLE.” AND THAT’S THE THING THAT I LOVE – I’VE BEEN DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING. I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPHER WHO HAS MORE PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOU AND MICHÈLE. MICHÈLE LAMY JOINS THE CONVERSATION. RO: HUN, WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW WE MET. DO YOU REMEMBER? THROUGH CHRIS WALLACE. ML: OF COURSE. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY CHRIS BECAME A WRITER AND WANTED TO MAKE MOVIES AND CONTINUE OUR STORY. AND HE CALLED AND SAID WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING WITH THE FURNITURE. AND THEN HE SAID, “I HAVE SOMEONE TO BE THE DIRECTOR AND THE DP AND EVERYTHING IN ONE PERSON.” WHICH WAS YOU, DANIELLE. DL: YES, CHRIS WORKED WITH YOU GUYS AT LES DEUX CAFÉ. HE&#39;S BRILLIANT. HE’S A WRITER, HE’S A PHOTOGRAPHER. ML: BACK THEN HE WAS A MAÎTRE D’. DL: AND ALSO, IF YOU WERE TO ASK HIM, HE WAS WAY MORE THAN THAT. HE TOOK CARE OF YOU TWO, AS YOU WERE NAVIGATING A VERY STRONG NIGHTLIFE … RO: OH, HE CARRIED US HOME. DL: HE WOULD CARRY YOU HOME. HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM. YOU’RE LIKE FAMILY. RO: I GUESS TO GET BACK TO THE BOOK, IT’S NOT LIKE I HIRED YOU TO DOCUMENT MY LIFE. YOU JUST BECAME FAMILY AND MOVED IN. DL: WHEN I LOOK AT THE BOOK, THESE IMAGES ARE NOT ABOUT ME. THIS IS ABOUT ME WANTING TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS HOW YOU WANT TO SEE YOURSELF. SO, WHEN I SEE THESE IMAGES, I FEEL PROUD OF THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT. RO: WHAT’S REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT FOUR OF THE COLLECTIONS WERE DURING COVID. WE SHOT IT WITH A SKELETON CREW IN LIDO, VENICE, BECAUSE I LIVE OUT THERE MOST OF THE SUMMER. IT&#39;S A TWO-HOUR DRIVE FROM THE FACTORY. SO, WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUR FACTORY TEAM OUT ON A COUPLE OF TRUCKS WITH THE CLOTHES, TAKE THEM TO MY PLACE IN LIDO AND DO THESE RUNWAY SHOWS ON THE BEACH. IT WAS IN JANUARY. IT WAS FREEZING COLD. AND IN WINTER, THEY BUILD THESE DUNES SO THAT THE WATER DOESN’T FLOOD THE STREETS. TO GET TO OUR RUNWAY, THE MODELS HAD TO CLIMB OVER THESE DUNES IN PLATFORM BOOTS. THAT WAS FUN. THEY WERE VERY MOVING EXPERIENCES BECAUSE IT WAS AN UNCERTAIN TIME FOR EVERYBODY. AND US, KIND OF BANDING TOGETHER AND PUTTING ON THIS LITTLE SCOTCH-TAPED DOG AND PONY SHOW IN THE FACE OF ALL THAT UNCERTAINTY AND THREAT. DL: AND YOU STILL HAD SMOKE. THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE FOG. EVEN AT THE BEACH. RO: WE DID PERSONALISED FOG MACHINES THAT YOU COULD CARRY. DL: ALSO THE SHOES HAD FOG MACHINES IN THEM. RO: AND THEN THERE WAS THE TEMPIO VOTIVO SHOW WHERE YOU WORE THE RED COAT. DL: THE RED COAT THAT NEVER DIES. I BROUGHT THIS FABULOUS FUN RED COAT. AND EVERYTHING AT THE LIDO IN JANUARY IS GREY AND EVERYTHING IN RICK’S COLLECTION WAS BLACK, GREY, OYSTER. RO: EVERYTHING WAS GREY LIKE A BEAUTIFUL OSSUARY TEMPLE. WE HAVE A VIDEO WHERE DANIELLE IS RUNNING AROUND SHOOTING PICTURES WEARING THIS RED COAT. DL: YES, I WAS ON THE PERIMETER BUT SOMEHOW I WAS IN EVERY FRAME. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I’VE SEEN RICK GET ANGRY. RO: OH, I DIDN’T GET ANGRY DL: BUT WE ALL KNOW COLLECTIVELY THAT THE RED COAT WAS A PROBLEM. [LAUGHS]. AND GUESS WHERE THAT RED COAT HAS LIVED SINCE? THE CLOSET – RETIRED. IT’S BEEN FUN. I FEEL VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE’VE HAD THIS CREATIVE CONNECTION. AND I FEEL GRATEFUL THAT THE PERSON THAT I’M HAVING A CREATIVE CONNECTION WITH IS YOU BECAUSE FASHION IS SUCH A FICKLE PLACE. YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLY LOYAL FRIEND, AND CREATIVE PARTNER AND I FEEL VERY LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO … I MEAN, I’D MOVE MOUNTAINS. YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU JUST WANT TO CREATE FOR SOMEBODY. YOU WANT TO GIVE BACK TO THEM AS THEY GIVE TO YOU.

WHILE WE&#39;VE ALREADY LEARNED SOME DETAILS FROM THE PRESS RELEASE, COULD YOU PLEASE SHARE IN YOUR OWN WORDS ABOUT &#39;MORE RICK OWENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY DANIELLE LEVITT&#39; AND WHAT IT REPRESENTS FOR YOU? WHEN WE WALK THROUGH ANY AIRPORT, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, WE ARE FORCED TO GO THROUGH A DUTY FREE PERFUME SHOP THAT IS PROMOTING A VERY SPECIFIC AND NARROW SET OF ASPIRATIONAL AESTHETIC VALUES. THE FASHION GROUPS AREN&#39;T DICTATING THIS - IT IS CONSUMER DEMAND DICTATING. I DON&#39;T REJECT THIS AESTHETIC, BUT I DO SLIGHTLY RESENT THE SMUGNESS OF ITS ABSOLUTENESS. ALL MY EFFORTS ARE TO PROPOSE AN ALTERNATE SET OF AESTHETICS TO THOSE WHO DON&#39;T SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THESE CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL STANDARDS. DANIELLE RECOGNIZES GROUPS THAT ARE DRAWN TOGETHER TO PURSUE VALUES OUTSIDE THE NORM AND DOCUMENTS THEM WITH GREAT AFFECTION AND RESPECT. WE ARE BOTH DRAWN Q. I BELIEVE THAT BOOK PROJECTS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF BRAND EXPRESSION, BUT WHAT DISCOVERIES I DON&#39;T REALLY DO BOOKS AS A CORPORATE BRAND PROMOTION, I DO IT MAINLY TO HAVE FUN. THERE ARE SO MANY BRANDS OUT THERE THAT ARE THE EXPRESSION OF COMMITTEE COMPROMISE. I THINK PEOPLE FORGET THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT EFFORT WITH EVERYTHING RELEASED OVERSEEN BY ONE PERSON. Q. I THINK THE PANDEMIC PERIOD IS MAINLY THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK, BUT LOOKING BACK AGAIN, WHAT IMPACT DID THAT PARTICULAR PERIOD HAVE ON YOU? THE QUARTET OF SHOWS WE DID DURING QUARANTINE ARE A FRACTION OF THIS BOOK BUT THEY WERE SUCH A BONDING EXPERIENCE - ALL OF OUR LIVES WERE REDUCED TO THE ESSENTIALS - ESSENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS, ESSENTIAL EXPRESSION - IT REALLY REDUCED THE CLUTTER AND DEFINED AND CLARIFIED OUR BASIC VALUES AND WHO AND WHAT WE REALLY CARED ABOUT. Q. WHERE DOES YOUR INSPIRATION COME FROM WHEN YOU DESIGN, AND WHAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU TO KEEP WHEN MAKING YOUR OWN DESIGNS SINCE LAUNCHING? MY MAIN GOAL IS TO LEAVE BEHIND A BODY OF WORK THAT HAS A CONSISTENT COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY AND HONESTY. EACH COLLECTION IS AN EVOLUTION OF THE ONE BEFORE - THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION WITHOUT DISPOSING PAST IDEAS.

THE DESIRE FOR FURTHER EXPLORAEON OF RICK OWENS&#39; WORK IS ENCAPSULATED IN THE ETLE OF A NEW PHOTO BOOK PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI. THE BOOK, FEATURING THE US DESIGNER&#39;S RECENT WORK, IS SET TO HIT BOOKSTORES IN OCTOBER. PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVIH, WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON A BOOK ON OWENS&#39; AESTHEEC, CAPTURES HIS NEW PHASE OF WORK AS HE EXPERIMENTED WITH NEW SHAPES, MATERIALS, AND COLORS. THESE YEARS COINCIDED WITH THE PANDEMIC, WHICH OWENS SPENT AT HIS HOUSE IN THE VENICE LIDO, WHERE HE HOSTED MEMORABLE FASHION SHOWS DESPITE THE FULL LOCKDOWN. THE BRAND IS NEARING ITS ALMOST THREE-DECADE-LONG EVOLUEON, WHICH WILL CULMINATE IN ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY IN 2024. OWENS&#39; COMMITMENT TO PROVOCAEON AND AVANT-GARDE IS A HALLMARK OF THIS EVOLUEON, AS HE EXPLAINED IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH MFF. WHAT DOES THIS BOOK TELL US ABOUT YOU? THIS BOOK HELPS TO EXPLAIN MY ETHOS- TO PROPOSE AN ALTERNATE SET OF AESTHETICS TO THOSE WHO DON&#39;T ALWAYS SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL STANDARDS, WHICH CAN BE RIGID AND NARROW AND SOMETIMES A BIT CRUEL. I RESPECT THE HISTORY OF CLASSICAL BEAUTY BUT TRY TO MAKE IT A BIT MORE FLEXIBLE. I AM SURE MY WORLD MAY ALIENATE SOME, BUT I HOPE OTHERS CAN FIND IT LIBERATING. WHAT WAS DANIELLE LEVITT ABLE TO GRASP WITH THESE IMAGES? THESE ARE THE BACKSTAGE MOMENTS BEFORE THE RUNWAY SHOW IN DANIELLE&#39;S TEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, WITH HARD TECHNO POUNDING IN OUR CAVERNOUS BACKSTAGE SPACE AND DANIELLE DANCING AND TWERKING AND CAJOLING THE MODELS INTO MOVEMENT AND ATTITUDE. THE CLOTHES ARE IN THEIR IDEAL STATE AND FRESHNESS AND ARE MINUTES AWAY FROM BEING PRESENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE PUBLIC- SHE’S CAPTURING A MOMENT OF ANTICIPATION AND EXHILARATION AND A BELIEF IN THE POWER AND GLORY OF AN INDEPENDENT PURSUIT OF BEAUTY….. PART OF THE BOOK RECOUNTS THE MOMENT OF THE PANDEMIC. WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THAT PERIOD? I REMEMBER THIS PERIOD AS A CHANCE FOR OUR TEAM TO BAND TOGETHER AND MEET AN UNCERTAIN MOMENT WITH OUR BEST EFFORTS. THEY REACTED WITH GREAT DIGNITY AND A SENSE OF HONOUR. I WAS VERY PROUD. YOU SPENT THIS TIME IN VENICE. WHY SUCH A STRONG BOND WITH ITALY? VENICE IS A 2-HOUR CAR RIDE FROM MY FACTORY, WHERE I WENT AS SOON AS I COULD TO PROTECT OUR SURVIVAL. WE NEEDED TO RECALIBRATE TO MEET THE MOMENT AND BE READY TO PIVOT AND STREAMLINE IN RESPONSE TO ANY SURPRISES. WHAT DOES ITALY REPRESENT FOR YOUR BRAND? ITALY HAS ALWAYS REPRESENTED GREAT PROWESS IN FASHION PRODUCTION- I FEEL LIKE I AM IN THE BEST POSSIBLE PLACE FOR EXECUTING THE KIND OF CLOTHES I WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR. WHAT’S THE SECRET BEHIND THE SUCCESS OF THE KISS BOOTS? I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE ENDED UP BEING JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF GROTESQUE IN A SOCIAL CLIMATE THAT WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM LITERAL REFERENCES BUT GENERATIONALLY READY TO EMBRACE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ARCHNESS. I DIDN&#39;T REALLY CALCULATE THAT MUCH. I JUST REALLY MADE THEM FOR MYSELF. YOU ARE THE OWNER OF YOUR COMPANY. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE OF THE BRAND? I ALWAYS SAY I WANT TO GET BETTER, NOT BIGGER. MY CREATIVE GESTURE NEEDS TO BE HEARTFELT AND BOLD, AND OUR METHODS NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND KIND. WE CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE. AND WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE OF FASHION? THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A NEED TO COMMUNICATE OUR HUMANITY THROUGH PERSONAL ADORNMENT. OR POWER. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND WILL CONTINUE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE METHODS OF EXECUTION MIGHT CHANGE BUT THE URGE NEVER WILL.

WHICH IS WHY RICK OWENS, WHO TODAY WITH HIS WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY AND THEIR PARTNERS ELSA LANZO AND LUCA RUGGIERI, RUNS A BUSINESS WITH NINE STORES AND OVER 800 RETAILERS WORLDWIDE, IS SOMEWHAT OF A UNICORN. FROM ITS HUMBLE START IN A SMALL STUDIO OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, TO A DELIBERATE INTRODUCTION TO THE VERY BEST L.A. BOUTIQUES FOLLOWED BY A FORTUITOUS COUPLE OF YEARS AT THE START OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE - A CORINNE DAY PICTURE OF KATE MOSS IN A RICK OWENS LEATHER JACKET IN FRENCH VOGUE, AN ANNIE LEIBOVITZ PORTRAIT IN AMERICAN VOGUE, A VOGUE-SPONSORED CATWALK SHOW IN NEW YORK, A CFDA AWARD, AND A GROWING ARRAY OF DISCERNING STOCKISTS IN EUROPE AND THE U.S. - RICK OWENS BY 2003 WAS ALREADY WELL ON HIS WAY TO BECOMING A PLAYER TO RECKON WITH. BUT NOT MUCH IS ACHIEVED IN THIS LIFE ON ONE’S OWN. AND RICK OWENS WITHOUT MICHÈLE, ELSA AND LUCA WOULD NOT BE THE COMPANY, OR MAN, WE KNOW AND LOVE TODAY. WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE STORY OF RICK OWENS, AS TOLD BY THE FOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE IT WHAT IT IS TODAY, BUT ALSO A STORY OF HOW TO CONSTRUCT A MAISON DE MODE AT A TIME WHEN THE INDUSTRY HAS GONE FROM DESIGNER-FOCUSED TO CORPORATE-LED. IT’S A STORY ABOUT WHY CHOOSING AUTONOMY OVER A QUICK BUCK CAN STILL, AT LEAST FOR A LUCKY FEW, PAY OFF IN THE LONG RUN. RICK OWENS: AMERICAN FASHION DESIGNER AND THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF OWENSCORP. BORN IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA IN 1962. LAUNCHED RICK OWENS IN 1994. MARRIED MICHÈLE LAMY IN 2006. MICHÈLE LAMY: FRENCH CULTURAL FIGURE WITH MANY PAST LIVES: RESTAURATEUR, DESIGNER, PERFORMER, FILM PRODUCER ARE JUST A FEW. BORN IN 1944. MOVED TO THE STATES IN 1979, STARTED THE FASHION BRAND LAMY IN 1990. MET RICK OWENS IN 1988. TODAY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RICK OWENS FURNITURE LINE. ELSA LANZO: LUCA RUGGERI’S SISTER-IN-LAW. ITALIAN. WORKED AS A SALES AGENT AT EB ASSOCIATES; BEGAN REPRESENTING RICK OWENS IN 2001. LEFT EBA IN 2003 TO WORK ONLY WITH RICK OWENS. TODAY THE CEO OF OWENSCORP. LUCA RUGGIERI: ITALIAN. WORKED AS A SALES AGENT AT EBA WITH ELSA, UNTIL THEY, WITH RICK AND MICHÈLE, STARTED OUT ON THEIR OWN. TODAY THE COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR OF OWENSCORP. RICK: I WAS PRETTY DIRECTIONLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO AFTER COLLEGE SO I JUST STAYED IN PORTERVILLE CALIFORNIA AT MY PARENT’S HOUSE, WORKING PART-TIME AT TACO BELL. I WAS COMPLETELY AIMLESS. I DIDN&#39;T EVEN MOVE TO L.A. ON MY OWN. MY MOM SAW THAT IF I STAYED IN PORTERVILLE I’D JUST SINK SO SHE KIND OF FORCED ME TO LEAVE. SHE TOOK ME TO GO LOOK FOR COLLEGES, SHE HELPED ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENROL AND HOW TO APPLY FOR APPLY FOR LOANS. SHE WENT APARTMENT-HUNTING WITH ME. IT IMPRESSES ME STILL. MOM WAS THIS CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC LADY FROM PUEBLA, MEXICO. SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF HER SIX BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO LEAVE WHICH WAS HONESTLY PRETTY PUNK ROCK OF HER. AND SHE APPLIED THAT SAME SENSE OF SURVIVAL AND AMBITION TO ME. BECAUSE TO SEND HER ONLY SON TO LOS ANGELES MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT SACRIFICE FOR SOMEONE LIKE HER. SO WITH HER HELP I MOVED TO L.A. TO GO TO ART SCHOOL IN MY EARLY TWENTIES. BUT I FELT TOTALLY OUT OF MY DEPTH. THE THEORY CLASSES INTIMIDATED ME AND I ENDED UP DROPPING OUT. I JUST THOUGHT I WASN’T INTELLECTUALLY CAPABLE. I KNEW I WAS GOOD WITH MY HANDS THOUGH: I KNEW THAT I COULD MAKE THINGS. SO WHEREAS BEING AN ARTIST SEEMED SO OUT OF REACH, IF I LEARNED A TECHNICAL SKILL I THOUGHT I’D HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF A GOOD LIFE. GOING INTO FASHION MADE SENSE, SO I DECIDED LEARN PATTERN-MAKING. I COULD ONLY AFFORD GOING TO A TECHNICAL COLLEGE, SO THAT’S WHAT I DID. I CAN’T SAY I EXCELLED - I WAS NEVER A PARTICULARLY DEDICATED STUDENT - BUT I WAS NATURALLY TALENTED AND THE TEACHERS COULD SEE THAT. EVENTUALLY I GOT A JOB IN THE LOS ANGELES GARMENT INDUSTRY, AND I WORKED THERE AS A PATTERN MAKER FOR YEARS, IN A STUDIO THAT KNOCKED OFF HIGH-END DESIGNERS LIKE CLAUDE MONTANA. AT THE SAME TIME I WAS CLUBBING A LOT: IT’S WHERE I FOUND MY PEOPLE. A FRIEND INTRODUCED ME TO MICHÈLE, AND SHE EVENTUALLY HIRED ME AS A A PATTERN MAKER FOR HER COMPANY, LAMY. MICHÈLE: I FIRST CAME TO L.A. IN 1979 TO SELL EYE GLASSES, WHICH WAS MY FAMILY’S BUSINESS BACK IN FRANCE. BUT WHEN I GOT THERE I REALISED THAT THEY DIDN’T SELL ANY CLOTHES I LIKED AND I HAD NOTHING TO WEAR. SO I DECIDED TO START MAKING CLOTHES MYSELF. I INVENTED THIS FABRIC, BASED ON THE KNITS SONIA RYKIEL USED TO MAKE, BUT MUCH STRETCHIER. I STARTED VISITING MANUFACTURERS AROUND TOWN TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP ME PRODUCE IT. EVENTUALLY I FOUND ONE BUT THEY WERE SO PLEASED WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY WANTED TO START SELLING IT THEMSELVES. I HAD TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO BUY THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS AND EVENTUALLY I MET A MAN AT A PARTY WHO AGREED TO HELP. LAMY WENT VERY WELL ACTUALLY: I SOLD TO BLOOMINGDALE&#39;S, MACY’S, NORDSTROM’S. THEY USED TO CALL ME ‘THE QUEEN OF NORDSTROM’ IN FACT. IN THE MID-80S I HAD ABOUT 12 EMPLOYEES. RICK WAS INTRODUCED TO ME BY A FRIEND I ALSO WORKED WITH, AND I HIRED HIM AS A PATTERN CUTTER. RICK: LAMY WAS SOLD AT ALL THE BEST DEPARTMENT STORES BACK THEN. THE STYLE WAS VERY SIMPLE, VERY PURE, ALMOST MINIMALIST, AND MICHÈLE HAD INVENTED HER OWN FABRIC WHICH WAS SUCH A SMART THING TO DO. BUT AS HER COMPANY GREW SHE STARTED HAVING TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS: LIKE WHETHER TO MOVE MANUFACTURING OUTSIDE OF L.A. IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH PRICES, HOW TO PRODUCE MORE FOR LESS BASICALLY. AND SHE JUST KIND OF LOST INTEREST AT THAT POINT. IT WASN’T FUN ANYMORE. MICHELE: BASICALLY, RICK KILLED LAMY. [LAUGHS] IN 1990 I HAD A $10 MILLION FASHION BUSINESS, A RETAIL STORE IN BEVERLY HILLS AND A FRENCH-STYLE BISTRO CALLED CAFE DES ARTISTES IN HOLLYWOOD. BUT AS TIME WENT ON, A LOT OF MY CLIENTS STOPPED PAYING ON TIME, OR AT ALL, AND I WAS IN DEBT. RICK WAS DOING THINGS HIS OWN WAY AT LAMY. HE CONVINCED ME TO FIRE THE FRIEND WHO BROUGHT HIM THERE BECAUSE HE WASN’T DOING ANYTHING. AND THEN HE DECIDED TO START EXPERIMENTING WITH THE LYCRA LINE I HAD. HE WANTED TO DO HIS OWN STUFF, AND I COULD SEE HOW TALENTED HE WAS. I BEGAN TO LOSE INTEREST IN THE COMPANY. I HAD STARTED MY SECOND RESTAURANT, LES DEUX CAFES, AND I WOULD SPEND ALL MY TIME THERE. RICK: BY THAT POINT WE HAD STARTED OUR RELATIONSHIP. I WAS VERY AMBITIONS AND DRIVEN BY THEN. I STARTED EXPERIMENTING AND MAKING THINGS IN MICHELE’S STUDIO, AND PUSHING HER TO CHANGE HER DIRECTION. LOOKING BACK IT WAS RATHER SELFISH OF ME BECAUSE SHE ALREADY HAD A VISION WHICH WAS VERY MUCH HERS. SHE WAS DOING JUST FINE BEFORE I CAME ALONG: SHE DIDN’T NEED ME AT ALL. BUT I GUESS IN A WAY IT WAS INEVITABLE: I HAD DISCOVERED MY OWN AMBITION AND I HAD TO PUSH TO GET WHAT I NEEDED. THERE I WAS WITH MY COMPETITIVE MALE AGGRESSION, WHICH IS BOTH EMBARRASSING BUT PROBABLY ALSO WHAT IT TOOK TO GET ME WHERE I AM TODAY. EVENTUALLY AS MICHELE DECIDED TO WIND DOWN LAMY AND FOCUS ON LES DEUX CAFES, I VENTURED OUT ON MY OWN. I DIDN’T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE FASHION INDUSTRY A THAT POINT: IN L.A. THE FASHION SCENE WAS VERY LOCAL, PROVINCIAL ALMOST. I WAS INTO EXTREME FASHION, CLUB WEAR BASICALLY. BUT I WAS READING FASHION MAGAZINES, AND STARTED LEARNING ABOUT WHAT WAS OUT THERE THROUGH THEM. PAPER MAGAZINE WAS A FAVOURITE: THEY FEATURED SYBILLA, JEAN PAUL GAULTIER, ANDRE WALKER, ADELINE ANDRE, ALAÏA. MICHELE: WHEN RICK AND I GOT INVOLVED I WAS MARRIED AND HAD A YOUNG DAUGHTER. THE FIRST YEARS WERE PRETTY DRAMATIC. RICK WAS LOST, AND DRINKING A LOT. IT WAS A REALLY INTENSE PERIOD. RICK: IT WAS A VERY BOHEMIAN PERIOD FOR US. WE LED THIS VERY GLAMOROUS LIFE, BUT WE WERE ESSENTIALLY BROKE. MICHELE WAS IN DEBT, AND I, IN MY TINY STUDIO ACROSS THE STREET FROM LES DEUX, WAS BARELY BREAKING EVEN. THAT&#39;S HOW IT WAS FOR A WHILE: VERY HAND TO MOUTH. I WAS DRINKING A LOT AT THAT TIME. I GUESS I NEED IT FOR COURAGE, TO JUSTIFY MY ARROGANCE WHICH KIND OF HORRIFIES ME NOW. I WAS THIS YOUNG MALE IN CAPTIVITY, BUTTING MY HEAD AGAINST THE CAGE BARS AND CHEWING MY LEG OFF TO GET OUT THERE TO GET WHAT I WANTED, WHICH IN MY CASE WAS RECOGNITION. MICHELE: RICK WOULD COME TO LES DEUX EVERY NIGHT AT 11PM AND WE WOULD HAVE DINNER TOGETHER. SOMETIMES I’D CLOSE THE CABARET BY SINGING AND HE COULD HEAR ME ACROSS THE STREET. WE SPENT EVERY NIGHT TOGETHER. RICK: LES DEUX BLOSSOMED, AND IN TIME MY WORK STARTED PICKING UP TOO. I STARTED SELLING TO A BOUTIQUE IN L.A. CALLED CHARLES GALLAY. HE WOULD BUY EVERYTHING I MADE AND PAY ME 50% UPFRONT AND 50% UPON DELIVERY WHICH IS WHAT GAVE ME SOME FOOTING. EVENTUALLY HE SAID, YOU NEED TO SELL YOUR STUFF IN EUROPE - WHY DON’T YOU GO TO PARIS TO SHOW YOUR WORK? AND HE INTRODUCED ME TO OTHER STORES AND BUYERS: JOAN BERNSTEIN FROM BROWNS IN LONDON, JOYCE FROM HONG KONG, ALAN BILZERIAN FROM BOSTON, SHELLEY SAME FROM HENRI BENDEL IN NEW YORK. HENRI BENDEL BECAME A VERY BIG BUYER OF MINE; IN FACT IT’S THROUGH THEM THAT VOGUE DISCOVERED MY WORK. ONE DAY ANDRE LEON TALLEY WAS WALKING PAST THE STORE ON FIFTH AVENUE AND SAW MY STUFF IN THE WINDOWS. HE HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS, BUT HE FOUND OUT AND CALLED ME OUT OF THE BLUE. AT THAT POINT I STILL WASN&#39;T CONNECTED AT ALL SOCIALLY NOR WAS I CONNECTING TO PHOTOGRAPHERS OR STYLISTS OR MODELS OR MAGAZINES. MICHELE: I DON’T KNOW WHY RICK ALWAYS INSISTS ON TALKING ABOUT CHARLES GALLAY: IT’S WHEN RICK STARTED SELLING TO MAXFIELD THAT HIS BRAND REALLY TOOK OFF. TOMMY AND ANNE-MARIE PERSE WERE GREAT SUPPORTERS: ANNE-MARIE WOULD WEAR RICK’S CLOTHES ALL THE TIME. THAT’S ALSO HOW MARIA LUISA DISCOVERED IT. LUCA: AT THE TIME ELSA AND I WORKED FOR AN ITALIAN AGENT CALLED EBA. IT STOOD FOR EO BOCCI AND ASSOCIATES: WE WERE THE ASSOCIATES. [LAUGHS] WE WERE IN PARIS AS USUAL THE SUMMER OF 2000, AND WE VISITED MARIA LUISA WHOSE BOUTIQUE WAS ALWAYS A GREAT PLACE TO FIND NEW TALENT. SHE TOLD US ABOUT THIS NEW DESIGNER SHE’S DISCOVERED: RICK OWENS FROM L.A. I REMEMBER THINKING, ‘L.A? ALL THEY DO WELL IS DENIM.’ BUT WE REALLY TRUSTED MARIA LUISA’S JUDGMENT SO WE WENT. WHAT I SAW REALLY INTRIGUED ME; SIMPLE JERSEY PIECES, BUT THE CUT AND DRAPING WAS ASTONISHING. ELSA: THERE WERE JUST A FEW PIECES IN THE STORE BUT I WAS IN LOVE. IT WAS EXACTLY THE AESTHETIC I FAVOURED. THERE WAS ONE PAIR OF TROUSERS, A SKIRT AND A T-SHIRT, ALL CUT ON THE BIAS. I BOUGHT THE TROUSERS: I HAVE THEM STILL. YOU’D PROBABLY RECOGNISE THEM: THEY’VE BECOME A SIGNATURE RICK OWENS PIECE. LUCA: FIVE MONTHS LATER I WAS IN L.A. ON BUSINESS, AND I REMEMBER ASKING ONE OF OUR CLIENTS, ‘SO IS THERE ANYONE I SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHILE I’M HERE?’ AND SHE TOLD ME, ‘GO SEE RICK OWENS.’ I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HIM, AND THERE WAS HIS NAME AGAIN! SO I CALLED HIM AND ASKED, ‘CAN WE MEET?’ HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS AND IMMEDIATELY SAID YES. WE MET AT MUSSO &amp; FRANK. I REMEMBER BEING LATE. OH MY GOD I WAS SO EMBARRASSED. WHEN I ARRIVED RICK WAS ALREADY EATING. I WAS DEVASTATED. BUT WE TALKED, AND AFTERWARDS WE WALKED TO LES DEUX CAFES TOGETHER, AND AS SOON AS I ENTERED I WAS MESMERISED. IT WAS FULL OF FAMILIAR FACES: PEOPLE I KNEW ABOUT FROM THE PAGES OF THE MAGAZINES. EVERYONE WAS FAMOUS: MADONNA, SEAN PENN, KEANU REEVES, COURTNEY LOVE. REAL HOLLYWOOD. BUT IT WASN’T JUST THE PEOPLE THAT IMPRESSED ME, IT WAS THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE. IT WAS PART RESTAURANT, PART NIGHTCLUB, PART CABARET. MICHELE WAS THE PERFECT ENTERTAINER, SHE WOULD SING LANGSTON HUGHES SONGS AND JUST MAKE EVERYONE FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE. I WAS FASCINATED BY RICK TOO: HE WAS SO HEALTHY, SO BEAUTIFUL, SO SKINNY, SO WELL DRESSED. I’D NEVER MET ANYONE WITH HIS ATTITUDE AND ALLURE. ELSA: I REMEMBER LUCA REPORTING BACK TO ME AFTER HE’D MET RICK IN L.A: ‘HE’S A GENIUS, A GENIUS!’ LUCA: THE NEXT MORNING I WENT BACK AGAIN TO MEET HIM AT HIS STUDIO, ACROSS THE STREET FROM LES DEUX CAFES. I VISITED THE APARTMENT WHERE HE LIVED WITH MICHELE AND IT ALL MADE PERFECT SENSE. THE AESTHETIC WAS SO WELL DEVELOPED ALREADY: THE INTERIORS, RICK’S DESIGNS, THE WAY THEY BOTH LOOKED, THE COMPANY THEY KEPT. THEY WERE PIONEERS: IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE. I DISCUSSED IT WITH MY PARTNERS AT EBA WHEN I GOT BACK TO ITALY BUT WE DID NOTHING ABOUT IT AT FIRST. LIFE GOT IN THE WAY. A FEW MONTHS LATER, IN MARCH 2001, I WAS BACK IN PARIS FOR FASHION WEEK AND I OPENED MODEM, A PUBLICATION THAT LISTED ALL SHOWROOMS AND DESIGNERS. MY EYES FELL ON AN AD FOR A SHOWROOM CALLED TOTEM, AND THERE WAS RICK’S NAME. I COULDN’T BELIEVE IT. I CALLED HIM STRAIGHT AWAY, AND IT TURNED OUT HE WAS IN PARIS TOO SO WE MET AGAIN. I ORGANISED FOR ELSA TO MEET HIM TOO: IT WAS IN THE SHOWROOM WE HAD AT PLACE DES VOSGES FOR OLIVIER THEYSKENS. RICK: I COULD TELL FROM THE START THAT ELSA AND LUCA WERE AMBITIOUS: THEY HAD DRIVE. I HAD SIGNED WITH TOTEM ALREADY, BUT I HONESTLY DON’T THINK I SOLD A SINGLE THING WHILE I WAS WITH THEM. I WAS READY TO LEAVE. ELSA: RICK WAS SO KIND AND POLITE; I IMMEDIATELY LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS I ALREADY LIKED HIS CLOTHES. AND MICHELE WAS FASCINATING: I COULDN’T STOP LOOKING AT HER. NOT LONG AFTER OUR MEETING IN PARIS LUCA AND I WENT TO L.A. TO SEE THEM AGAIN, THIS TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTRACT AND HOW TO WORK TOGETHER. I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY LES DEUX CAFES. IT WAS MAGICAL: LIKE STEPPING INTO ANOTHER WORLD. WE STARTED OUT BY TALKING ABOUT HOW WE COULD HELP RICK GET A GOOD MANUFACTURING DEAL, AND THEN HOW TO SELL THE COLLECTION WORLDWIDE. LUCA AND I HAD THE CONNECTION AND EXPERIENCE TO DO THAT. AT THE BEGINNING YOU DON’T NEED ALL THAT MANY RETAIL STORES, BUT YOU NEED TO POSITION YOURSELF WELL. AND WE ALREADY WORKED WITH THE RIGHT STORES WORLDWIDE. ONCE YOU’RE IN THE RIGHT STORES, YOU OF COURSE NEED TO ACTUALLY SELL - IF NOT YOU WON’T GET A SECOND OPPORTUNITY. BUT IF YOU DO CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS, THE WORLD OPENS UP TO YOU. AND RICK DID. RICK: I REMEMBER ELSA AND LUCA TOOK ME ON LONG DRIVE ALL AROUND ITALY TO LOOK FOR MANUFACTURERS WHO WOULD AGREE TO PRODUCE MY CLOTHES FOR A LICENSE. IT WASN&#39;T EASY. WE DIDN&#39;T HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL THEN BUT ELSA AND LUCA WERE PRO. THE COMPANY THEY HAD BEEN WITH HAD BEEN SELLING ALEXANDER MCQUEEN, ANN DEMEULEMEESTER AND OLIVIER THEYSKENS. THEY HAD THE RIGHT ROLODEX. LUCA: IT TOOK SOME WORK BUT EVENTUALLY WE FOUND A FACTORY CALLED OLMAR &amp; MIRTA IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED CONCORDIA OUTSIDE BOLOGNA, THAT AGREED TO MANUFACTURE RICK’S COLLECTIONS. FINDING THE RIGHT LICENSEE AND MANUFACTURER IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IT HAS TO BE A GOOD FIT. THE MANUFACTURER HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY NO TO THE PRODUCTION OF A PARTICULAR DESIGN, AND OFTEN THAT’S A TRAP THAT DESIGNERS FIND THEMSELVES IN. THE LICENSEE AND MANUFACTURER WANT TO PRODUCE THE MORE COMMERCIAL PARTS OF THE COLLECTION BUT NOT THE EDGY ONES. RICK: ONCE WE FOUND THE FACTORY IN CONCORDIA AND GOT A DEAL WITH THEM, EVERYTHING CHANGED. ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAD MONEY. IT WASN&#39;T THE MONEY I HAVE NOW BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY MORE MONEY THAN I HAD EVER HAD BEFORE. THE FIRST THING I DID WAS GET A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR. THERE WAS THIS CELEBRITY SERVICE OFFERED BY HERTZ IN L.A. WHERE THEY WOULD BRING YOU A FRESH LINCOLN TOWN CAR EVERY TWO WEEKS. SO I STARTED THAT PROGRAM. THEN I RENTED A BLACK BABY GRAND PIANO FOR THE STUDIO JUST BECAUSE IT WAS SO ELEGANT. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF ANYBODY EVER PLAYED IT - I CERTAINLY NEVER DID. IT WAS JUST THIS BEAUTIFUL BIG BLACK SYMBOL OF CULTIVATION AND AFFLUENCE. I REMEMBER FEELING A GREAT SENSE OF SATISFACTION - FINALLY WE’RE ON OUR WAY. ELSA: AT THE BEGINNING EVERYTHING WAS VERY SPONTANEOUS AND INTUITIVE. WE DIDN’T HAVE A GRAND PLAN. WE JUST REALLY GOT ALONG, FOUND THAT WE HAD THE SAME AMBITIONS, SO TAKING ONE STEP AFTER ANOTHER TOGETHER CAME VERY NATURALLY. PIECE BY PIECE WE BUILT THE GROUP THAT BECAME OWENSCORP. RICK: EVERYTHING FELT RIGHT. ELSA AND LUCA TREATED ME LIKE AN ARTIST, AND NEVER TRIED TO INFLUENCE MY WORK. THEY WERE VERY RESPECTFUL. BUT WE WERE ALL EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS, AND WE HAD A LOT RIDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THIS VENTURE. WE ALL REALLY WANTED IT TO WORK. ELSA: WHEN WE STARTED TO WORK WITH RICK OUR DREAM WAS TO BUILD A MAISON. WE WERE THINKING ABOUT ALAÏA: A HOUSE WHERE EVERYTHING IS FOCUSED ON THE DESIGNER. MY JOB WITH LUCA WAS TO CREATE A BUBBLE AROUND RICK SO THAT HE COULD FOCUS ON CREATING, AND WORK WITHOUT THE PRESSURE OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES INTO A BUSINESS. SO WE BUILT EVERYTHING BASED ON THAT PREMISE. RICK HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOD [LAUGHS], IN CHARGE OF ALL THINGS CREATIVE AS WELL AS COMMUNICATION. HE CHOSE ME TO BE THE CEO FROM DAY ONE SO I MANAGED THE COMPANY AND PUT THE TEAM TOGETHER. I DECIDED TO PUT LUCA IN CHARGE OF THE COMMERCIAL. MICHELE WAS INVOLVED IN THE REVILLON FUR COLLECTION, THEN SHE STARTED THE FURNITURE BUSINESS. WE’VE ALL EVOLVED WITH OUR ROLES AS THE COMPANY HAS GROWN. IMAGINE: AT THE BEGINNING WE HAD 50 RETAILERS; TODAY WE’VE GOT 800. RICK STARTED OUT DOING TWO COLLECTIONS A YEAR; NOW IT’S 18. WE STARTED AS FOUR; TODAY WE EMPLOY 250 PEOPLE. LUCA: IN 2001 WE RENTED A SHOWROOM IN NEW YORK TO INTRODUCE RICK OWENS TO THE BUSINESS - THEN SEPTEMBER 11 HAPPENED. THE PRESENTATION GOT CANCELLED, AND WE ALL GOT STUCK IN NEW YORK. IT WAS A VERY STRANGE MOMENT. ELSA: IT WAS SUCH A DIFFICULT MOMENT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WAS VERY BONDING FOR US. LUCA: THREE WEEKS LATER WE HAD A PRESENTATION IN PARIS INSTEAD BECAUSE THE SHOW MUST GO ON. I THINK WE GOT 65 CLIENTS AFTER THAT SEASON: 15 OF THOSE WE STILL WORK WITH, CAN YOU IMAGINE? ELSA: I KNEW WE WERE ON TO SOMETHING FROM THE GET GO: THE FIRST 50 CLIENTS CAME EASY, AND THE COLLECTION SOLD OUT STRAIGHT AWAY. YOU CAN’T GET A MUCH BETTER SIGN THAT THAT. WE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT OUR CLIENTS PAID IN ADVANCE, WHICH THEY DID SINCE THEY ALREADY KNEW AND TRUSTED LUCA AND ME. WE WERE VERY TOUGH ON THAT: EITHER THE CLIENT ACCEPTED OUR TERMS OR WE WERE NOT THE RIGHT BRAND FOR THEM. LUCA: I REMEMBER ASKING RICK EARLY ON WHETHER HE’D EVER CONSIDER DOING A SHOW AND HE SAID NO. BUT LATER IN FACT, IN NOVEMBER 2001, HE HOSTED HIS VERY FIRST SHOW AT LES DEUX CAFES IN L.A. ON HIS 40TH BIRTHDAY. IT WAS VERY SMALL, JUST FOR FRIENDS AND CLIENTS. BUT I THINK IT GAVE HIM THE CONFIDENCE TO DO IT ON A BIGGER SCALE, AND THE YEAR AFTER AMERICAN VOGUE SPONSORED HIS FIRST OFFICIAL SHOW IN NEW YORK. RICK: WHEN VOGUE OFFERED ME MY FIRST RUNWAY SHOW I WAS NERVOUS; I DIDN’T KNOW WHERE IT WOULD TAKE ME. BY THAT TIME I WAS ENVISIONING A LIFE AS AN OBSCURE DESIGNER ON THE FRINGES OF THE BUSINESS, A CHARLES JAMES TYPE FIGURE MAKING EXQUISITE CLOTHES IN HIS OWN WAY, LIVING IN GLAMOROUS SQUALOR. SO WHEN I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MY FIRST SHOW I KNEW IT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE FOREVER. WHEN YOU GET ON THAT TRAIN YOU HAVE TO RIDE IT TILL THE END. LUCA: THAT FIRST SHOW WAS LIKE A PUNCH IN THE FACE, IN A GOOD WAY. IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE: THE COLOUR PALETTE, THE MUSIC, THE LIGHTS, THE MODELS. OH MY GOD THE MODELS WERE COMPLETELY OTHERWORLDLY. HAVE YOU SEE PICTURES? THE AESTHETIC WAS ALREADY THERE, AND A LOT OF DESIGNS WE STILL PRODUCE 20 YEARS LATER. I REMEMBER SEEING FARAH FAWCETT IN THE AUDIENCE, AND JULIANNE MOORE. EVERYONE WAS REALLY HAPPY AFTERWARDS. RICK: I KNEW HOW NARROW MY AESTHETIC IS SO I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SUSTAIN IT. MY EVOLUTION WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SLOW, AND I KNEW IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO BURN OUT FAST. AND THE FIVE FIRST YEARS AFTER MY VOGUE SHOW I DID WOBBLE AT TIMES. I FELT THE PRESSURE TO ENTERTAIN, PROVIDE EXCITEMENT. AT THE SAME TIME I KNEW I WASN’T ALEXANDER MCQUEEN. I WASN’T FULLY CONFIDENT YET. SO AT THE BEGINNING I JUST HAD TO FAKE IT. BUT THAT SAID I HAD HELP: I’D MET THE PHOTOGRAPHER CORINNE DAY, AND THROUGH HER THE STYLIST PANOS YIAPANIS. HE JUST KIND OF SHOWED UP FOR MY FIRST SHOW IN NEW YORK AND HELPED OUT, AND NEVER LEFT. WE WORKED TOGETHER FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. HE WAS A FASHION FREAK, AND VERY INFLUENTIAL TOO. I’M SURE HE STOPPED ME FROM MAKING MANY MISTAKES. AND AS I LEARNED MORE MY INITIAL ARROGANCE WAS REPLACED BY A QUIET CONFIDENCE. MICHELE: THERE WAS A TIME WHEN ELSA AND LUCA DIDN’T WANT THEIR CLIENTS TO COME TO THE SHOWS :THEY WERE AFRAID THEY’D BE OFFENDED OR FRIGHTENED BECAUSE THEY COULD BE SO EXTREME. BUT PEOPLE KEPT BUYING THE CLOTHES. LUCA: MICHELE REALLY STARTED TO SHINE IN OUR LIFE WHEN SHE MOVED WITH RICK TO PARIS: SHE BECAME LIKE THE COMPANY VISIONARY. SHE’S THE ONE THAT PUSHED RICK TO ACCEPT THE OFFER OF CREATIVE DIRECTING REVILLON, THE FRENCH FUR COMPANY, WHICH I THINK WAS GENIUS. RICK: I WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH TO THE FACTORY IN ITALY SO OFTEN THAT I EVENTUALLY REALISED THAT TRAVELLING LIKE THAT JUST WASN’T GOING TO WORK. MICHELE STARTED COMING WITH ME, AND ON ONE TRIP I NOTICED HAT SHE HAD PACKED A BIT MORE THAN USUAL. I REMEMBER SAYING TO HER: ‘YOU’RE NOT GOING BACK TO L.A. ARE YOU?’ AND SHE DIDN’T. SO WE BOTH ENDED UP MOVING TO EUROPE JUST LIKE THAT, VERY SPONTANEOUSLY. WE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND, NOTHING WAS ORGANISED. MICHELE WAS READY FOR A NEW ADVENTURE SO SHE LEFT LES DEUX CAFES, AND WE HIRED SOMEONE TO PACK AND SHIP EVERYTHING IN OUR APARTMENT AND STUDIO. AND THAT WAS THAT. MICHELE: I USED TO SAY TO FRENCH PEOPLE IN L.A. WHO ASKED, ‘SO WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK TO PARIS:’ I’LL GO BACK WHEN I CAN LIVE AT THE PALAIS BOURBON. AND NOW WE DO. RICK: BY THE TIME WE MOVED I HAD SIGNED DEAL WITH REVILLON. I’D ACTUALLY ASKED ANNA WINTOUR FOR ADVICE WHEN THEY REACHED OUT TO OFFER ME THE ROLE AS CREATIVE DIRECTOR, AND I REMEMBER HER RESPONSE WAS VERY BRIEF: ‘THERE’S NO MONEY, DON’T DO IT.’ BUT I DID IT ANYWAY. [LAUGHS] LUCA: I CAN CONFIRM THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THAT DEAL. BUT STILL, IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. IT OPENED A LOT OF DOORS. AND SOON AFTER RICK AND MICHELE MOVED TO PARIS THEY STARTED MAKING FURNITURE AS WELL. THEN IN 2006 WE OPENED OUR FIRST RICK OWENS STORE IN PALAIS ROYALE - WE STILL HAVE IT. ELSA: WE DIDN’T WANT OUTSIDE INVESTMENT SO WE BUILT EVERYTHING SLOWLY USING OUR OWN MONEY. THAT WAS KEY I THINK BECAUSE WE ALL AGREED THAT MONEY WASN’T THE MOST IMPORTANT, BUT RATHER THE AESTHETIC VALUE OF WHAT WE WERE CREATING. RICK: I’VE HAD OFFERS OVER THE YEARS TO CREATIVE DIRECT ANOTHER COMPANY BUT WHEN THEY CAME ALONG I COULD AFFORD TO FOCUS ON MY OWN HOUSE SO SAYING NO WAS EASY. NOW I THINK THAT’S THE GENERAL CONSENSUS BECAUSE I HAVEN’T BEEN ASKED TO GO ELSEWHERE FOR A LONG TIME. TO ME WORKING FOR ANYONE BUT MYSELF WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE: HAVING TO MAKE COMMITTEE DECISIONS, HAVING TO COMPROMISE ALL THE TIME AND JUSTIFY YOUR DECISIONS TO A BOSS. NEVER KNOWING IF YOUR CONTRACT WILL BE RENEWED. OH GOD NO I COULDN’T DO IT. LUCA: OF COURSE OVER THE YEARS WE’VE CONSIDERED WHETHER TO SELL A STAKE IN THE COMPANY, OR WHETHER TO STAY INDEPENDENT. THERE ARE PROS AND CONS, AS WITH EVERYTHING. BUT ULTIMATELY WHEN YOU SELL, YOU LOSE YOUR SOUL. I’M SORRY BUT THAT’S MY OPINION. IT’S THE BEGINNING OF THE END. AN INVESTOR WILL ALWAYS LOOK AT A BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY FROM ITS FOUNDER. IT’S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH: THEY’RE LOOKING FOR RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT IN 3-5 YEARS. SO IF YOU’RE READY TO RETIRE, THAT’S THE TIME TO SELL. YOU TAKE THE MONEY, AND YOU GO ON TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. ELSA: THE DECISION TO STAY INDEPENDENT HASN’T BEEN EASY BECAUSE AS A PART OF A CONGLOMERATE YOU HAVE MANY ADVANTAGES, AND YOU CAN GROWN MUCH FASTER. BUT YOU’RE BEHOLDEN TO SOMEONE ELSE; YOU DON’T GET TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS ANYMORE. ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE DID SERIOUSLY CONSIDER IT BUT DECIDED THAT THE TIME WASN’T RIGHT: WE WERE TOO YOUNG, AND WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH OURSELVES ON OUR OWN TERMS. RICK IS SO SPECIFIC IN EVERY ASPECT OF HIS WORK, AND WE WANTED TO PROTECT HIS VISION AND ENSURE IT WASN’T DILUTED. MICHELE: STAYING INDEPENDENT IS PERFECT FOR RICK, AND IT’S A TRIUMPH FOR ELSA. AS FOR ME, I DON’T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT. SOME PEOPLE WERE DISCARDED ALONG THE WAY, LIKE EO BOCCI. BUT I SUPPOSE THAT’S THE WAY IT GOES. LUCA: WHEN WE STARTED THIS BUSINESS IT WAS EASY TO GET INVESTMENT FROM ITALIAN MANUFACTURERS. THERE WERE SO MANY FACTORIES IN ITALY STILL, AND THEY WERE DOING BIG BUSINESS. TO INVEST IN A NEW DESIGNER WAS NOT A BIG RISK, AND IF THE DESIGNER HIT THE BIG TIME THE PAYOFF WAS GREAT. NOW UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THOSE FACTORIES HAVE CLOSED, AND MANUFACTURING HAS MOVED ELSEWHERE: TURKEY, PORTUGAL, MOLDAVIA. IF YOU GO TO PORTUGAL YOU PAY 30% LESS. IN TURKEY 50% LESS. IF YOU GO TO NORTH AFRICA YOU PAY EVEN LESS. SINCE THE EARLY 2000S ITALY HAS LOST THE ADVANTAGE THEY USED TO HAVE, AND ‘MADE IN ITALY’ DOESN’T MEAN AS MUCH. SO YOUNG DESIGNERS HAVE TO GET INVESTMENT IN OTHER WAYS: YOU CAN SEE WHY SELLING 40% OF YOUR BRAND TO A CONGLOMERATE LIKE LVMH IS TEMPTING. ELSA: IT’S TRUE. WHEN WE STARTED IN THE EARLY 2000S THE MARKET LOOKED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT: INDEPENDENT RETAILERS WERE STILL VERY IMPORTANT, THERE WAS NO E-COMMERCE, NO SOCIAL MEDIA AND NO SMART PHONES, THE CHINESE MARKET DIDN’T EXIST FOR WESTERN BRANDS. BACK THEN THE GOAL WAS TO START SELLING WHOLESALE, AND EVENTUALLY TO OPEN YOUR OWN RETAIL SPACES. WE STARTED WITH FIFTY STORES THE VERY FIRST SEASON WE WORKED TOGETHER, AND IT GREW FROM THERE. PRICE WISE WE LOOKED AT POSITIONING RICK ALONGSIDE CORRESPONDING BRANDS: MARGIELA, OLIVIER THEYSKENS, ANN DEMEULEMEESTER. WE REALLY PAID ATTENTION TO THE PRICE STRATEGY: WE DIDN’T WANT IT TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN HIS COMPETITORS. WHEN CUSTOMERS CHOOSE WHAT TO BUY, THEY SELECT SOMETHING WITHIN A CERTAIN BENCHMARK SO IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NEITHER BE TOO EXPENSIVE NOR TOO CHEAP. MICHELE: THE MODEL I USE IS COMME DE GARÇONS. IF IT WASN’T FOR RICK, I’D WEAR COMME ALL THE TIME. THEY HAVE FOUND THEIR OWN WAY, AND THEY’VE STAYED INDEPENDENT ALL THESE YEARS. I USED TO TALK A LOT WITH ADRIAN JOFFE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR COMPANY; AT ONE POINT I PROBABLY KNEW MORE ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE THAN I DID IN MY HOUSE. [LAUGHS] LUCA: IT’S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR YOUNG DESIGNERS TODAY: THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAS CHANGED, THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT. THINK OF THE LVMH PRIZE. I’M SURE IT’S HELPFUL TO SOME YOUNG DESIGNERS, BUT IT’S ALSO THERE TO FUNNEL IDEAS STRAIGHT INTO THE CONGLOMERATE - AND TO GET YOUNG DESIGNERS USED TO WORKING WITH THEM. I DON’T BLAME THEM, THOUGH. STAYING INDEPENDENT TODAY IS NIGH ON IMPOSSIBLE. ELSA: IT DOESN’T MEAN THAT WE WOULD NEVER CONSIDER BECOMING A PART OF A GROUP, CONSIDERING ALL AVENUES IS PART OF MY JOB. IF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY COMES ALONG, YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO TAKE IT. ANYWAY, TODAY WE’RE A MATURE COMPANY, STABLE AND VERY CONSISTENT. SO OUR BARGAINING POWER, OUR LEVERAGE IS MUCH GREATER. WHAT I WANT FOR THE FUTURE NOW IS TO ENSURE THAT RICK OWENS REMAINS A STRONG BRAND, UNAFFECTED BY HYPE, AND BUILT TO LAST. AND I THINK WE’RE GETTING THERE. RICK: MY PATH HAS BEEN A FAIRY TALE. BECAUSE VERY INNOCENTLY I JUST MADE STUFF AND I PUT IT OUT THERE AND HOPED SOMEONE WOULD COME ALONG TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. AND THEY DID, AND IT DID. THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS THAT COULD GO WRONG; HAVING BUSINESS PARTNERS THAT ARE GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO AND THAT PROTECT YOU AND ALLOW YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU’RE GOOD AT IS SUCH AN UNUSUAL THING. I KNOW HOW LUCKY I AM TO WORK WITH HONEST AND RELIABLE PEOPLE. I’M VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT I’VE HAD MORE THAN MY SHARE OF VALIDATION. GETTING THE AMOUNT OF SUCCESS AND RECOGNITION I’VE HAD IS HUGE AND VERY RARE.

HE SPOKE CANDIDLY ABOUT HIS ENCOUNTERS WITH PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVITT, HIS THOUGHTS ON EACH SEASON&#39;S COLLECTION, AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY. ON THE DAY OF THE INTERVIEW, I HEADED TO THE RICK OWENS TOKYO STORE IN MINAMI AOYAMA AND FOUND HIS STAFF, ALL DRESSED IN BLACK, GATHERED AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE. AMONG THEM WAS HIS WIFE, MICHELE LAMY, WHO SAID, &quot;I WANT A BLACK CRAYON EYELINER.&quot; WHEN I ENTERED THE STORE AND WENT TO THE SOFA AREA IN THE BACK, I WAS GREETED BY RICK OWENS, WHO HAD A STRONG PRESENCE. HE WAS DRESSED IN HIS CLASSIC STYLE, SPORTING A BLACK SHIRT, SHORTS, A CAP, AND BOOTS. WHEN I SHOWED HIM MY NAILS DECORATED WITH &quot;RICK OWENS&quot; FOR THE DAY, HE SMILED AND SAID, &quot;I LOVE IT! THAT’S SO COOL!&quot; HE EVEN TOOK A PHOTO OF MY NAILS AND POSTED IT ON THE BRAND&#39;S OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM. HE ALSO SHOWED US SOME PHOTOS HE HAD TAKEN ON HIS TRIP OF THE SUNSET AND A MYSTERIOUS CAVE COVERED IN SPIDERWEBS. THIS GAVE US A GLIMPSE INTO HIS GENEROUS AND KIND PERSONALITY. WHEN ASKED ABOUT SHOOTING WITH DANIELLE LEVITT AND HIS LATEST COLLECTION, HE SHARED HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT HESITATION. THE VISUALS PUBLISHED IN THIS BOOK, MORE RICK OWENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY DANIELLE LEVITT, ARE IMPRESSIVE IN THEIR UNIFIED WHITE BACKGROUND. IS THERE A REASON FOR THIS? I FIRST MET DANIELLE WHILE FILMING A DOCUMENTARY. AT THE TIME, SHE WAS PHOTOGRAPHING COMMUNITIES OF MARGINALIZED PEOPLE CONNECTED THROUGH SHARED VALUES. AMONG THEM WERE A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO CALLED THEMSELVES THE WOLF PACK, A GROUP OF OLDER GAY MEN, CHEERLEADERS, AND A SOCCER TEAM. THROUGH HER WORK, YOU COULD TELL SHE HAD A VERY DEEP LOVE FOR OTHERS, AND I REMEMBER BEING FASCINATED BY HER KINDNESS. I LIKE THE ENERGY SHE HAS AND HER WORK. YOU CAN SAY THAT BEING AROUND DANIELLE’S ENERGY IS AN INSPIRATION IN ITSELF. I HAVE A HARD TIME SURRENDERING TO MY EMOTIONS, AND I DON&#39;T HAVE THE SPONTANEITY THAT DANIELLE DOES. MY DRIVING FORCE IS TO MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE HONEST, SINCERE, AND SPONTANEOUS, WHICH I DON&#39;T HAVE MYSELF. I STARTED WORKING WITH DANIELLE 10 YEARS AGO, AND ABOUT 5 AGO, SHE SUGGESTED SOMETHING TO ME, “WHY DON&#39;T YOU CHANGE THE LIGHTING? HOW ABOUT SHOOTING OUTSIDE?&#39;&#39; MY ANSWER, HOWEVER, WAS NO BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT A LARGE COLLECTION THAT TOOK SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY TO PUT TOGETHER HAD TO BE CONSISTENT. I PERSONALLY CHOOSE THE MODELS, STYLE THEM, AND THEN DO ANOTHER FINAL CHECK. THIS PROCESS MUST ALWAYS BE FLAWLESS. IN ONE CORNER OF THE STUDIO, WE HAVE THE HAIR AND MAKEUP TEAM’S SETUP; IN THE BACKGROUND, WE HAVE MUSIC BY BRUTALISM 3000, AND THE SPACE IS FILLED WITH THE SMELL OF HAIRSPRAY AND CIGARETTES. WE BELIEVE THERE IS VALUE IN PHOTOGRAPHING THE COLLECTION IN THIS SPECIAL, ENERGY-FILLED SPACE. THE PHOTOS IN THIS BOOK WERE TAKEN BACKSTAGE JUST BEFORE THE SHOW, AND YOU CAN SEE EACH IMAGE COME TO LIFE. DANIELLE AGREED TO THIS PROCESS. SHE TAUGHT ME THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING LONG-LASTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN GOOD AT OPENING UP TO PEOPLE AND HAVE AVOIDED GETTING INVOLVED WITH MANY PEOPLE, BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH, I FEEL A SPECIAL SENSE OF SECURITY WITH DANIELLE. IN THE PREFACE OF THE BOOK YOU WROTE, &quot;DANIELLE HAD A GENTLENESS AND WARMTH THAT WAS THE OPPOSITE OF THE DARKNESS THAT PEOPLE EXPECTED FROM ME.&quot; DID YOU MEAN THAT AT THAT TIME, THE RICK OWENS BRAND NEEDED ELEMENTS LIKE HER PERSONALITY AND WORK? NO, THAT&#39;S NOT THE CASE. NOWADAYS, MANY DESIGNERS THINK ABOUT THE ARCHIVE BEFORE THE COLLECTION. WHEN I STARTED MY BRAND, I DIDN&#39;T KNOW IF THE BRAND WOULD SURVIVE, AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HOLDING ON UNTIL THE NEXT SEASON, SO I SOLD SAMPLE LOOKS WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE ARCHIVE. HOWEVER, RECENTLY, THAT CONCEPT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. I AM LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BRAND&#39;S SURVIVAL AND CAN NOW THINK ABOUT THE ARCHIVE EVEN BEFORE THE COLLECTION. I HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTING MY COLLECTIONS WITH PHOTOGRAPHS, BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, I HAVE BEGUN BUILDING A SOLID ARCHIVE COLLECTION. I HAD NEVER CONSIDERED THE BRAND&#39;S FUTURE, SO BUILDING THIS ARCHIVE COLLECTION IS A BIG STEP FORWARD. IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE GAINED CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF THE BRAND. THE RECENT SPRING/SUMMER 2024 COLLECTION IN PARIS WAS COLORFUL AND FILLED WITH POSITIVE ENERGY. IT ALSO SEEMED TO CELEBRATE FEMININE STRENGTH. IN TERMS OF INSPIRATION FOR THIS COLLECTION, I WAS INFLUENCED BY DIANA ROSS. WHEN WE THINK OF A FASHION SHOW, WE START WITH THE MUSIC AND THE SHOES. THESE ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE SHOW. SHOES TAKE TIME TO CREATE, SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEM FROM THE BEGINNING, BUT WE THINK ABOUT THE MUSIC PARALLEL TO THE COLLECTION. WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC, I WORK WITH FRIENDS TO CREATE REMIXES OF 3 TO 15 MINUTES. WE COMPLETELY DECONSTRUCT AND REMIX AN EXISTING SONG BY REPEATING OR EXPANDING PARTS TO BEST SUIT OUR COLLECTION. THE MUSIC BY DIANA ROSS HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF MY LIFE SINCE I FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN MUSIC IN THE 70S. I FIRST HEARD &quot;MAHOGANY&quot; AS THE THEME SONG TO THE MOVIE &quot;MAHOGANY TALES&quot; IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. I STILL LISTEN TO &quot;LOVE HANGOVER&quot; WHEN I GO FOR WALKS AND &quot;MUSCLES&quot; AT THE GYM. WHILE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS COLLECTION, A FRIEND PLAYED ME THE NEW DIANA ROSS ALBUM, AND MY WIFE MICHELE ASKED THROUGH DIANA&#39;S SON IF WE COULD USE IT IN THE SHOW, AND TO MY DELIGHT, SHE SENT ME A TRACK FROM THE ALBUM. INITIALLY, THE SONG WAS A CHEERFUL POP DISCO TUNE, BUT WE DECIDED TO ONLY KEEP HER VOCALS AND CHANGE THE TUNE. AT NEARLY 80 YEARS OLD, HER VOICE IS PRECIOUS, RAW, AND POWERFUL. THE REMIXED VERSION GAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IMPRESSION FROM THE ORIGINAL TUNE. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF DIANA HERSELF SAW MY SHOW, BUT IF I HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET HER, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK HER. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE INSPIRED BY A BJÖRK CONCERT YOU ATTENDED. BJORK&#39;S CONCERT WAS MORE THAN INSPIRATIONAL; IT WAS A REMINDER OF POSITIVE THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS. SHE WAS ARTICULATE AND PERSUASIVE, WITH A STRONG AWARENESS OF SOCIAL ISSUES. SEEING HER LIKE THAT MAKES ME ASK MYSELF IF I MIGHT NEED TO BE MORE ACTIVE. BUT THAT IS NOT JUST A PESSIMISTIC WAY OF PUTTING IT; I BELIEVE THERE IS HOPE IN CREATING SOMETHING. THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IS A PLACE WHERE SPLENDOR AND DISAPPOINTMENT ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER. SO, I FOCUS ON THAT REALITY IN EVERYTHING I DO. RICK OWENS&#39; CLOTHES ARE SURPRISING AND IMPRESSIVE WHEN YOU TOUCH THEM. ONE EXAMPLE IS USING UNEXPECTED MATERIALS SUCH AS TRANSLUCENT COWHIDE AND PIRARUCU SKIN. FUSING THESE MATERIALS WITH A CREATIVE APPROACH TO SILHOUETTES AND SHAPES IS ALSO A MASTERSTROKE. WHAT ARE YOU MOST CONSCIOUS OF WHEN CHOOSING UNIQUE FABRICS AND SILHOUETTES? SPEAKING OF SILHOUETTES, I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF DESIGNS THAT BREAK UP THE BODY SILHOUETTE. FOR EXAMPLE, I AM FASCINATED BY STYLES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE REST, SUCH AS SILHOUETTES THAT BREAK THE STEREOTYPES OF THE BODY SHAPE AND OFFER A NEW INTERPRETATION, RATHER THAN A BLOUSE AND AN A-LINE SKIRT WITH A MARY JANE. MY FIRST DESIGN WAS A PLAIN T-SHIRT, BUT I DARED TO MAKE THE LENGTH AND SLEEVES A LITTLE LONGER. IT IS A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE, BUT I AM CONSCIOUS OF DESIGNING UNCONVENTIONALLY BY CHOOSING MATERIALS AND EXAGGERATED SILHOUETTES UNAVAILABLE ELSEWHERE. THIS AWARENESS OF DESIGN STEMS FROM MY UPBRINGING. I GREW UP IN A CONSERVATIVE AND CRITICAL FAMILY ENVIRONMENT. I DEVELOPED A SENSE OF RIVALRY FROM BEING IN THAT CONSERVATIVE ENVIRONMENT. IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO BROADEN THE EXISTING AESTHETIC STANDARDS THAT TEND TO NARROW AND TO SHOW WHAT IS POSSIBLE. THE DRESSES MADE OF PIRARUCU SKIN ARE PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE. WHAT MADE YOU FOCUS ON SUCH MATERIALS? PIRARUCU IS CONSUMED FOR FOOD, BUT THE SKIN IS DISPOSED OF AS WASTE. HOWEVER, BY TURNING PIRARUCU SKINS, WHICH ARE USUALLY DISCARDED, INTO A PRODUCT, WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE AMAZONIAN COMMUNITY. IT LOOKS EERILY LIKE DINOSAUR SKIN, BUT TRANSFORMING IT INTO A BEAUTIFUL CREATION IS FASCINATING, AND FOR ME, IT IS THE PERFECT LEATHER MATERIAL. IT ALSO MEANS I CAN REDUCE WASTE AND GIVE BACK TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. PLEASE TELL US ABOUT YOUR VISION AND GOALS FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS. IT&#39;S ABOUT GETTING BETTER. I WANT TO BE AS VOCAL AS POSSIBLE ON ISSUES OF INCLUSION, BIAS, AND DISCRIMINATION. AS I HAVE TOLD MY TEAM, I WOULD LIKE TO PLACE MORE IMPORTANCE ON GROWTH THAN EXPANDING THE BRAND. I&#39;M GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING I&#39;VE ACCOMPLISHED, BUT I&#39;D RATHER STAY HUMBLE THAN GAIN STATUS OR POWER. FASHION OFTEN GETS CAUGHT UP IN EGO AND STATUS, BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON FASHION&#39;S GENTLE AND SOFTER SIDE. COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND MICHELE LAMY IN ONE WORD? SYMBIOSIS. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS WORD? SYMBIOSIS MEANS TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. WHAT I HAVE, SHE DOES NOT HAVE. CONVERSELY, I DON&#39;T HAVE WHAT SHE HAS. IT&#39;S A GOOD HARMONY.

WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF DOWN JACKETS DRAWN BY RICK OWENS? WE SPOKE TO THE DESIGNER HIMSELF — NOVEMBER 30, 2023 — BY NAOKO SASAKI RICK OWENS IS KNOWN FOR HIS UNIQUE AND AVANT-GARDE CREATIONS AND HAS NOW COLLABORATED WITH MONCLER ON THE MONCLER + RICK OWENS COLLECTION, WHICH FINALLY LAUNCHED IN JAPAN. WE INTERVIEWED RICK OWENS, THE DESIGNER WHO MASTERFULLY MANIPULATES JACKETS. THIS MONCLER + RICK OWENS COLLECTION WAS ORIGINALLY UNVEILED IN FEBRUARY DURING LONDON FASHION. THIS IS THE THIRD COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES, FOLLOWING THEIR FIRST COLLABORATION IN OCTOBER 2020 AND LAST YEAR&#39;S PROJECT FOR MONCLER’S 70TH ANNIVERSARY. WE SPOKE TO RICK OWENS ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ON DESIGNING DOWN JACKETS AND THE SLEEPING POD. YOUR BRAND HAS A LOT OF PASSIONATE FANS. DID YOU NEED A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO WORK WITH MONCLER?RICK OWENS: MY APPROACH IS THE SAME WITH ANY PROJECT- HOW CAN I CREATE SOMETHING HONORABLE AND HONEST WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS AND RESOURCES PROVIDED? MONCLER OPERATES AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF PRESENTATION, AND MAKING SOMETHING POWERFUL BUT RESPONSIBLE IS MY PRIORITY WHEN WORKING WITH THEM. WE BELIEVE THAT YOU PRIORITIZE HIGH-QUALITY MATERIALS IN YOUR DESIGNS. IS THIS REFLECTED IN THIS COLLECTION?RICK OWENS: I WANTED TO EXPLORE WORKING WITH DENIMS WOVEN WITH ECO-CONSCIOUS COTTONS DYED RESPONSIBLY. I WANTED A SOFT, EARTHY, AND SYLVAN MOOD. WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE SPACE YOU PRESENTED? RICK OWENS: I ALWAYS START WITH MY OWN PERSONAL NEEDS- I HAD BEEN CONSIDERING GETTING AN APARTMENT IN NY BUT WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE CONSTANT BUZZ OF ENERGY AND CONSTRUCTION THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE THERE- I THOUGHT AN ISOLATION POD PANIC CHAMBER WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA AND CAME UP WITH THIS SLEEPING POD. I DECIDED AGAINST GETTING A PLACE IN NY AND AM NOW INSTALLING THIS BED IN MY HOUSE IN PARIS. IS THE SLEEPING POD ITSELF A SPACESHIP? IT LOOKS LIKE A BED WITH A FUTON ON IT. IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPACE AND &#39;SLEEP’?RICK OWENS: IT IS A PRIVATE AND INSULATED PLACE OF REPOSE, RETREAT, REJUVENATION, AND RECHARGE. AN EXQUISITE ESCAPE. PHYSICAL BEAUTY SEEMS TO BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO YOU. DOWN JACKETS TEND TO BE LIKE A QUILT COVERING UP THE BODY&#39;S LINES. IS THERE A SPECIFIC AREA IN YOUR COLLECTION THAT YOU WANTED TO AVOID?RICK OWENS: I LOVE TO DISTORT THE BODY AND PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES TO WHAT THE RULES ARE REGARDING WHAT IS FLATTERING AND WHY THAT MATTERS. I RESPECT CLASSICAL BEAUTY BUT ENJOY PROPOSING FLEXIBILITY. THE RICK OWENS COLLECTION IN 2017 FW WAS IMPRESSIVE FOR ITS EXTENSIVE USE OF COLORFUL DOWN MATERIALS. HAVE DOWN JACKETS ALWAYS BEEN A SPECIAL ITEM FOR YOU?RICK OWENS: PROTECTION AGAINST THE ELEMENTS WITH FEATHERS IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL DESIGN STORY… GENERALLY, DOWN JACKETS OFTEN LOOK LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF THE FASHIONABLE WITH DENIM. HOWEVER, DOWN JACKETS FEEL VERY FREE IN YOUR COLLECTION. ISN&#39;T IT CHALLENGING TO CREATE A DOWN JACKET THAT IS BOTH WEARABLE AND INTERESTING IN TERMS OF DESIGN?RICK OWENS: ANYTHING CAN BE FASHIONABLE WITH INTEGRITY AND BOLDNESS YOUR COLLECTIONS ARE ALWAYS SCULPTURAL, WITH BEAUTIFUL SILHOUETTES FROM ALL ANGLES. DO YOU THINK QUILTING IS THE KEY TO CREATING DOWN SILHOUETTES?RICK OWENS: BEING ABLE TO SCULPT WITH FEATHERS IS POETIC- AND BEING ABLE TO ADD NEW VOLUMES TO THE BODY IN UNEXPECTED PLACES IS A MESSAGE THAT STANDARD EXPRESSIONS OF BEAUTY NEED NOT BE SO STRICT. WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION OF DOWN JACKETS TO YOU?RICK OWENS: I LOVE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF SOMETHING SO LIGHT AND COMPRESSIBLE WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE AND IN WHAT SITUATIONS WOULD YOU LIKE THIS DOWN TO BE WORN BY? RICK OWENS: I WOULD LOVE ALL MY CLOTHES TO BE WORN BY GENTLE SOULS WITH OPEN SPIRITS WHO ARE ACTIVELY FOLLOWING KIND PURSUITS.

OWENS: “I FEEL LOVE,” THE BEST SONG EVER IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. OTTENBERG: HOW MANY SIT-UPS DO YOU DO? OWENS: I JUST DO 200 AT MOST, 100 IF I’M LAZY. OTTENBERG: I THINK I’M GOING TO LISTEN TO “MACARTHUR PARK SUITE” AFTER THIS REALLY LOUD AND DO SIT-UPS. I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE GYM THIS MORNING, BUT I SKIPPED IT BECAUSE WE HAD A PARTY LAST NIGHT. OWENS: ARE YOU STILL SOBER? OTTENBERG: YES. OWENS: HOW DOES THAT WORK? OTTENBERG: IT WORKS FINE. MAYBE I’M A BIT MORE BORING BECAUSE I’M MORE PRACTICAL, BUT I THINK AT THIS TIME IN MY LIFE, IT’S THE ONLY WAY TO BE. I HAVE A CLEAN MIND AND I’M VERY AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE’S BULLSHIT. IT’S AN EASY WAY TO KEEP THE GOOD ONES IN AND KEEP THE BAD SHIT OUT. OWENS: I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU MAINTAIN INTEREST THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU’RE A SMART, FUNNY GUY, BUT THERE’S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO AREN’T SMART AND FUNNY THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHEN YOU GO OUT, AND IT’S NOT WORTH IT TO ME SOMETIMES. OTTENBERG: I DON’T GO OUT THAT OFTEN. OWENS: GOING OUT FOR YOU THOUGH IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE YOUR ROLE IS TO SEEK OUT PEOPLE THAT ARE SPARKLING. IT’S ALWAYS BEEN HARD FOR ME TO FIND THEM. I’M NOT SAYING THAT’S BECAUSE MY TASTES ARE SO ELEVATED, IT’S JUST THAT THERE’S A LOT OF BAD STUFF OUT THERE. THERE’S SO MANY LOUD VOICES LOOKING FOR ATTENTION IN THE WRONG WAYS. OTTENBERG: YES. OWENS: BOTH OF OUR JOBS ARE TO EDIT AND BE SELECTIVE, AND THAT SOUNDS SO ELITIST AND JUDGY, BUT I HOPE THAT WE DO IT KINDLY. I WAS JUST READING CATHY HORYN IN THE CUT TODAY AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF FASHION. SHE’S SMART, BUT HER TONE CAN BE SO SNARKY. OTTENBERG:I THINK YOU AND I, AND WE’VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR QUITE A LONG TIME, ARE NOT ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH WHAT WE’RE FINDING, BUT WE’RE DEFINITELY OPEN TO FINDING IT. OWENS: WE’VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR AROUND 20 YEARS. OTTENBERG: I WAS AT YOUR FIRST FASHION SHOW IN NEW YORK IN 2002. I WAS INTERNING BACKSTAGE, PUTTING SHOELACES THROUGH EVERYONE’S BELT LOOPS. OWENS: YEAH. THE FIRST SONG TO THE FIRST FASHION SHOW THAT I EVER DID IS STILL AN ANTHEM FOR ME. IT WAS ALICE COOPER’S “SICK THINGS.” OTTENBERG: WAIT, HOLD ON. I REALLY LIKE LOOKING UP LYRICS. OWENS: I DO THAT, TOO. READ THE WHOLE THING, IT’S REALLY GOOD. IT COULD BE MY MANIFESTO. OTTENBERG: “SICK THINGS IN CARS/ ROTATE ROUND MY STARS/ SICK THINGS, MY THINGS/ MY PETS, MY THINGS./ I LOVE YOU THINGS I SEE AS MUCH/ AS YOU LOVE ME/ YOU THINGS ARE HEAVENLY WHEN/ YOU COME WORSHIP ME./ YOUR THINGS ARE CHILLED WITH/ FRIGHT FOR I AM OUT TONIGHT./ YOU FILL ME WITH DELIGHT, YOU/ WHET MY APPETITE.” THOSE WERE THE LYRICS TO YOUR FIRST FASHION SHOW. TALK ABOUT AN EDITOR. YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR SHIT, BABY. OWENS: I STAND BY THOSE LYRICS. I SHOULD PRINT THEM ON SOMETHING. OTTENBERG: YOU SHOULD. IS ALICE COOPER ONE OF THE FOREFATHERS THAT CREATED YOUR AESTHETIC? OWENS: HE ABSOLUTELY IS, BUT LIKE A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE, HE SLIPPED OVER INTO SOMETHING COMICAL. IT’S A TRICKY THING. YOU SEE PEOPLE EMBRACING SOMETHING THAT’S NEW, THAT FEELS GROTESQUE AND ALMOST THREATENING, AND THEN IT LOSES ITS BITE. KISS WAS LIKE THAT. WHEN KISS WAS STARTING OUT THEY WERE GENUINELY A THREAT AND I GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT GENE SIMMONS WAS VOMITING BLOOD AND THAT HE HAD REALLY SLIT HIS TONGUE. THEY REALLY WERE SCARY. THEN AFTER A WHILE THEY BECAME CARTOONS. OTTENBERG: IT’S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU’RE GOING OUT ON A LIMB AND YOU’VE REALLY GOT A LOOK, TO ALWAYS BE OPEN TO THE EVOLUTION OF SAID LOOK. OTHERWISE, YOU’RE JUST GOING TO BECOME A TROPE OF YOURSELF. HOW DO YOU AVOID GOING SOFT LIKE ALICE COOPER OR KISS? OWENS: IT’S ALWAYS HONEST AND IT’S GOT TO BE REAL. I REMEMBER READING AN INTERVIEW WHERE ALICE COOPER SAID, “PEOPLE NEED TO SEPARATE ME FROM MY STAGE PERSONA.” I WAS CRUSHED. I WAS LIKE, “YOU DON’T REALLY MEAN IT?” THAT WAS A BIG LESSON FOR ME. YOU CAN’T PUT SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT YOU DON’T BELIEVE IN, OR ELSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE THROUGH IT. I DON’T LIKE PHONINESS. NOW, THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEBODY WHO DOES SHOWS WITH SMOKE AND MIRRORS AND FIREBOMBS. I BELIEVE IN ARTIFICE AND THEATER, BUT BEHIND IT, THERE HAS TO BE A GENUINE ETHOS AND A GENUINE CONNECTION. OTTENBERG: TOTALLY. OWENS: HONESTY IS THE MAIN THING. AND I ALSO WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED. I WANT EXCITEMENT. I WANT TO BE SHOCKED. AND I WANT TO PUT STUFF OUT THERE THAT I WANT TO SEE. RIGHT NOW I’M READING BIOGRAPHIES ABOUT THE AESTHETIC PEAKS PEOPLE REACHED IN THE PAST AND IT MAKES ME COMPETITIVE AND HUNGRY FOR THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. OTTENBERG: ARE YOU A HARSH CRITIC OF YOUR OWN WORK? OWENS: IT WOULD BE TOO DRAMA QUEEN TO TORTURE MYSELF. SOMETIMES I THINK, “I REALLY HIT A BULLSEYE THERE.” AND THEN SOMETIMES I THINK, “THAT WAS NICE,” OR, “THAT’S ADEQUATE.” I’M RARELY EVER DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I WORK TOO HARD ON THINGS. IT TAKES A LONG TIME AND A LOT OF ENERGY, BUT IF YOU HAVE AN END GOAL THAT YOU CAN VISUALIZE, YOU CAN GET THERE. SO EVERY FASHION SHOW IS REALLY A PLEASURE. I DON’T KNOW IF THIS WILL LAST FOREVER, BUT THIS IS THE WAY IT’S WORKED FOR ME. OTTENBERG: RIGHT. OWENS: BECAUSE AT THE BEGINNING I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING AND I WAS GRASPING A BIT, I WAS MAKING SOME MISTAKES. BUT THEN AFTER A WHILE I LEARNED HOW TO OPERATE WITH WHAT I HAD. AND ONCE I GOT BETTER AT IT, I LEARNED TO RELAX AND HAVE FUN. IF YOU DON’T TRY AND PRETEND TO BE SOMEBODY YOU’RE NOT, YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING GOOD. OTTENBERG: GOOD ADVICE. OWENS: BY THE TIME THE SHOW COMES AROUND, I’VE PUT TOGETHER THE BEST OF WHAT I CAN AS HONESTLY AS I CAN DO IT. USUALLY, I THINK, “OKAY, THIS IS NICE AND THIS’LL WORK.” AND SO SHOW DAY IS USUALLY A REALLY RELAXED DAY FOR ME. IT’S LIKE A BIRTHDAY PARTY. WE MET THE DEADLINE AND WE GOT IT THERE. AND NOW ALL THAT’S LEFT IS TO ENJOY UNWRAPPING IT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY. MAYBE SOMEDAY IT’LL CHANGE, BUT I DON’T REALLY HAVE THAT STRESS OF, “ARE PEOPLE GOING TO LIKE IT?” I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S SELF-SATISFACTION, BUT BY THE TIME IT’S THERE, I’M THINKING, “IF I LIKE IT, SOMEBODY’S GOT TO LIKE IT.” OTTENBERG: FUCK YEAH. I LIKE IT. WE LIKE IT. OWENS: THANKS, MEL. OTTENBERG: SURE, RICK. I’M GOING TO ASK YOU SOME RAPID-FIRE QUESTIONS. ARE YOU READY ? OWENS: GO. OTTENBERG: DO YOU LIKE ANSWERING QUESTIONS? OWENS: PROBABLY TOO MUCH. SOMETIMES I DO THESE THINGS AND I’M THINKING, “WOW, YOU REALLY LIKE THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN VOICE, DON’T YOU?” OTTENBERG: WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW? OWENS: I’M LISTENING TO UNICORN ON KETAMINE, WHICH IS GABBER TECHNO, AND SHIRLEY HORN—OLD JAZZ—AND JULIE LONDON. OTTENBERG: FABULOUS. OKAY. WHAT DO YOU COLLECT? OWENS: I DON’T COLLECT ANYTHING. I GET RID OF STUFF ALL THE TIME. THE THING ABOUT HAVING THINGS AROUND IS THAT THEY BECOME INVISIBLE, THEY JUST BECOME TROPHIES. THAT BEING SAID, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME IS THIS BRONZE FUTURIST HEAD ON TOP OF A PILLAR THAT I HAVE HERE PROUDLY IN MY APARTMENT IN LIDO. SO I DO COLLECT A FEW THINGS, BUT NOT A LOT. OTTENBERG: SO WHAT’S YOUR BAD HABIT, RICK? OWENS: SMOKING, I GUESS. I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S THAT BAD. OTTENBERG: CIGARETTES? OWENS: YEAH. OTTENBERG: WHAT BRAND? OWENS: MARLBORO LIGHT 100S. OTTENBERG: TRUE GLAMOUR. OWENS: WELL, WHAT’S TRULY GLAMOROUS IS I HAVE A STASH THAT THEY SEND ME FROM JAPAN BECAUSE THE PACKS ARE WHITE AND THE CIGARETTES ARE ALL WHITE AND THEY’RE PRETTIER. OTTENBERG: HOW MANY A DAY? OWENS: OH, LIKE EIGHT. OTTENBERG: WOW. FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU WAKE UP? OWENS: MAKE COFFEE. OTTENBERG: HOW DO YOU TAKE YOUR COFFEE? OWENS: BLACK, ESPRESSO. OTTENBERG: SAME. OKAY. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR GYM ROUTINE—WAIT, WE ALREADY DID DONNA SUMMER. FYI, I’M GOING TO WEAR A SILICONE ABS MUSCLE OUTFIT WHEN I’M MODELING YOUR MONCLER COLLAB BECAUSE I’M FEELING FAT, AND I DON’T WANT TO GO ON OZEMPIC BECAUSE I DON’T THINK THAT’S HOT FOR ME. IT’S THE SAME AS BOTOX. OWENS: IT’S TOTALLY VALID TO DO DRUGS FOR A WEEK JUST TO GET YOURSELF OVER SOME KIND OF HUMP. I DON’T THINK I WOULD HAVE THE BODY THAT I DID IF I HADN’T TAKEN STEROIDS 20, 25 YEARS AGO. OTTENBERG: THEY SET YOUR BODY RIGHT? LOOK AT THIS. [LIFTS UP SHIRT] OWENS: OH, MY GOD. OTTENBERG: THAT’S NOT GIVING STEROIDS. RICK, IT’S FAT. OWENS: YEAH, BUT THAT’S GIVING A DIFFERENT KIND OF HOTNESS. THERE’S A MARKET FOR THAT. OTTENBERG: YEAH, I DO FINE. I JUST WANT TO LOOK GOOD IN CLOTHES. BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT’S ABOUT YOU. WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO EAT? OWENS: CAKE. OTTENBERG: OH MY GOD, YOU’RE IN VENICE. HARRY’S BAR, THAT FUCKING CAKE. OWENS: YOU KNOW I GET THOSE TO GO. OTTENBERG: WOW. SO YOU HAVE THAT BODY RIGHT NOW AND YOU STILL EAT THAT HARRY’S BAR CAKE BECAUSE YOU TOOK STEROIDS 25 YEARS AGO. WE ARE REALLY TEACHING THE PEOPLE THINGS TODAY. WAIT, WHAT IS THAT CAKE CALLED? OWENS: VANILLA CREAM MERINGUE. OTTENBERG:I HAVEN’T EATEN SUGAR IN 51 DAYS, BUT I WILL DEFINITELY BE EATING THAT CAKE AGAIN SOON. WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE INTERNET RABBIT HOLE? OWENS: GOD, I CAN’T THINK OF ONE. PORN, I GUESS. PORN WILL LEAD YOU TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF PORN, TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF PORN, AND I’M ALWAYS GOING, “HOW MANY DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS CAN I LOOK AT?” AND THEN AN HOUR LATER, IT’S— OTTENBERG: RIGHT. YOU’RE STILL LOOKING AN HOUR LATER. WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE BODY PART, RICK? OWENS: OF MINE OR OF SOMEBODY ELSE’S? OTTENBERG: YOURS. OWENS: I GUESS MY TITS ARE PRETTY GOOD. OTTENBERG: THEY ARE. OWENS: I’VE BEEN WEARING A LOT OF DEEP V-NECKS AND I SHOW MY TITS A LOT. I’M NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM FOREVER, SO I’M GOING TO WORK THEM WHILE I CAN. OTTENBERG: THOUGHTS ON PLASTIC SURGERY FOR YOURSELF, FOR OTHERS? OWENS: I HAVEN’T DONE SURGERY, BUT I’VE TRIED PROCEDURES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN, AND IT WAS SO DARK. I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS WAS CALLED, BUT IT’S LIKE A NEEDLE UNDER YOUR—I’LL HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE NAME OF THIS PROCEDURE IS. THEY MOVE THE NEEDLE AROUND AND INJECT LORD KNOWS WHAT. THEY HAD TO PUT NOVOCAINE IN, AND THEN I’M GOING, “WAIT. MY TEETH FEEL LIKE THEY’RE DECOMPOSING. I CAN HEAR THEY’RE TURNING TO SAND.” IS THAT— OTTENBERG: IS THAT GOOD? OWENS: I REALLY TRUST THIS GUY IN PARIS, AND HE GOES, “THAT HAPPENS. DON’T FREAK OUT.” BUT I WAS, BECAUSE I WAS THINKING, “WHAT HAVE I BEEN TALKED INTO?” IT WAS LIKE BEING IN A K-HOLE. I WAS GOING, “I’M NOT COMING BACK FROM THIS.” IT WAS SO DARK AND SCARY, AND THE LAST TIME I EVER DID ANYTHING. BUT I HAVE NEVER DONE FILLERS. I’VE DONE BOTOX, BUT TO BE HONEST, I COULDN’T REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE THAT MUCH, SO I JUST STOPPED. OTTENBERG: OKAY. OWENS: FILLERS ALWAYS END UP LOOKING FAT. MY GUY WAS GOING, “THERE’S A GAUNTNESS THERE THAT WE COULD FILL IN.” AND I’M GOING, “BUT THAT GAUNTNESS IS WHO I AM.”I WANT TO END UP LOOKING LIKE A SLEAZY CREEP. OTTENBERG: RIGHT. I’M REALLY FASCINATED BY THESE SQUARE JAWS. THEY’VE TAKEN OVER AMERICA. IT’S LIKE THEY FILL YOUR JAW WITH SOME CEMENT AND THEN THEY SMUSH IT INTO A SQUARE. SOMEONE SAID I ALREADY HAVE THAT KIND OF JAW, WHICH I APPRECIATE. OWENS: I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY YOU AND I ARE OKAY BECAUSE WE’VE GOT SQUARE JAWS, SO WE DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. OTTENBERG: RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING ON TV? OWENS: I JUST WATCHED THE LAST DOWNTON ABBEY AND WE’RE GOING TO KEEP WATCHING THE GREAT WITH ELLE FANNING AS CATHERINE THE GREAT. IT’S PRETTY FUNNY. OTTENBERG: IT IS PRETTY FUNNY. OWENS: BUT IT’S ALSO VERY IMPRESSIVE. THE COSTUMES AND THE SETS AND THE SCENERY ARE JUST TOP-NOTCH, BEAUTIFUL. OTTENBERG: WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE CLUB? OWENS: OF ALL TIME? I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS, AND MICHELE [LAMY, OWENS’S WIFE] AND I USED TO GO TO SALLY’S HIDEAWAY IN TIMES SQUARE. DO YOU REMEMBER SALLY’S HIDEAWAY? OTTENBERG: SALLY’S IS PRE–MY TIME, BUT THE PICTURES ARE BURNED INTO MY HEAD OF THE DOLLS IN FRONT OF SALLY’S. INCREDIBLE. OWENS: THERE WAS SALLY’S HIDEAWAY AND THEN SALLY’S II. AND I WAS HAVING THESE VISUALIZATIONS OF THE DANCE FLOOR THERE AND THE WEIRD STRIP SHOWS, AND ALSO THE SPOTLIGHT BAR IN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, AND HOW MICHELE AND I USED TO GO THERE A LOT. I WAS THINKING, “WOW, WE RAN THIS HISTORY OF SUPER SLEAZY DIVE BARS.” OTTENBERG: I’VE BEEN FRIENDS WITH YOU GUYS FOR SO LONG, I HAVE MET YOU TOGETHER OR SEPARATELY ON A LOT OF 7 A.M., 8 A.M. DANCE FLOORS. MICHELE IS SUCH A GOOD DANCER. SHE’S ONE OF THE BEST, AS ARE YOU. OWENS: ACTUALLY, WE JUST WENT DANCING LAST SATURDAY NIGHT. THEY’RE DOING THESE THINGS AT THE BOURSE DE COMMERCE, THE MUSEUM IN PARIS. THERE’S THIS REALLY GOOD BASEMENT, AND LAST SATURDAY, DJ YOUSUKE YUKIMATSU FROM JAPAN WAS PLAYING THERE. THE ONLY REASON I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS SPACE WAS BECAUSE I HIRED HIM TO DJ THIS PARTY THAT I’M GOING TO BE HAVING IN JAPAN IN OCTOBER. I’M DOING A PARTY IN JAPAN IN OCTOBER, BY THE WAY. YOU’RE INVITED. OTTENBERG: FANTASTIC. OWENS: ANYWAY, SO WE WENT TO GO CHECK HIM OUT, AND IT’S PART OF AN ART EVENT, SO IT ENDED AT 12:30, BUT MICHELE AND I GET THERE AT 11 BECAUSE THAT’S WHEN HE WENT ON, AND HE WAS SO FUCKING GOOD. THAT’S THE LAST TIME I WENT DANCING. OTTENBERG: I LOVE DANCING. WHAT’S THE BEST PLACE FOR PEOPLE-WATCHING? OWENS: THE AIRPORT IS ALWAYS INTERESTING. IT’S LIKE BEING AT A ROCK CONCERT. IT’S EVERYBODY FROM ANYWHERE AND NO MATTER HOW FABULOUS YOU ARE, YOU ALL HAVE TO GO PISS IN THAT TINY STUPID BATHROOM ON THE AIRPLANE. OTTENBERG: WHERE DO YOU GO TO HIDE, RICK? OWENS: OH, MY MONCLER SLEEP POD. OTTENBERG: OH MY GOD, ABSOLUTELY. ALRIGHT, I’M GOING TO STOP TALKING TO YOU NOW BECAUSE WE’VE BEEN TALKING FOR 90 MINUTES AND I WANT THE WHOLE THING TO GO IN THE MAGAZINE, BUT I COULD TALK TO YOU FOREVER. WILL YOU HAVE A PARTY DURING PARIS [FASHION WEEK] SO WE CAN DANCE? OWENS: COME TO THE HOUSE THE NIGHT OF THE SHOW. I KNOW WE’RE HAVING A DINNER, I DON’T KNOW HOW BIG IT IS, BUT COME. OTTENBERG: WELL, BIG OR SMALL, I’LL BE THERE. LOVE YOU, THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO ME TODAY. OWENS: WELL, WE NEEDED AN EXCUSE TO CATCH UP ANYWAY. OTTENBERG: FANTASTIC. ALRIGHT. BYE, RICK. LOVE YOU. OWENS: BYE. LOVE YOU. Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

HE HELD A BOOK SIGNING AT THE BOON THE SHOP GALLERY IN CHEONGDAM, SEOUL, TO CELEBRATE THE RELEASE, TO WHICH ALL HIS KOREAN FANS WERE INVITED. &#39;MORE RICK OWENS&#39; IS A PHOTO BOOK CREATED WITH HIS LONGTIME FRIEND AND PHOTOGRAPHER, DANIELLE LEVITT. IT FEATURES A COLLECTION OF IMAGES FROM THE BRAND’S COLLECTIONS FROM THE 2019 FALL/WINTER SEASON TO THE 2023 SPRING/SUMMER SEASON. THE GARMENTS FEATURED IN THE BOOK ARE QUITE DARING FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE TO WEAR. NEVERTHELESS, RICK OWENS&#39; CLOTHING STRONGLY INFLUENCES &quot;CITY NOMAD&quot; FASHION IN THE GLOBAL GENERATION 2030. ENTHUSIASTS OF HIS STYLE DON&#39;T REFER TO THEMSELVES AS &quot;FANS&quot; BUT AS &quot;FOLLOWERS.&quot; WHAT COULD BE THE REASON BEHIND THIS? RICK OWENS WAS BORN IN CALIFORNIA, USA IN 1961. HE STUDIED ART FOR TWO YEARS AT OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN. HE THEN TOOK PATTERNMAKING AND DRAPING COURSES AT LOS ANGELES TRADE-TECHNICAL COLLEGE. AFTER WORKING FOR SEVERAL CLOTHING COMPANIES, HE LAUNCHED HIS OWN BRAND IN 1994 AND GAINED RECOGNITION WHEN HE MADE HIS DEBUT IN 2002 NEW YORK FASHION WEEK. IN 2004, HE RELOCATED TO PARIS, WHERE HE HAS BEEN RUNNING HIS FASHION EMPIRE AND PARTICIPATING IN PARIS FASHION WEEK TO THIS DAY. HE IS ONE OF THE FEW COMPANIES THAT OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT BEING SOLD BY LARGE GROUPS LIKE LVMH. RICK OWENS IS OFTEN CALLED &quot;THE LORD OF DARK FASHION&quot; AND &quot;A DESIGNER&#39;S DESIGNER.&quot; THIS IS BECAUSE HE CONSISTENTLY SHOWCASES REMARKABLE CREATIVITY IN DESIGNING DARK, MELANCHOLIC, YET ALLURING CLOTHING, ALONG WITH BLACK AS A CENTRAL COLOR. HIS FASHION SHOWS ALSO CONSISTENTLY GENERATE ATTENTION IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. IN OCTOBER 2015, HIS COLLECTION WAS SHOWCASED ON FEMALE MODELS WHO CARRIED OTHER MODELS AS IF THEY WERE BACKPACKS. RICK OWENS EXPLAINED THAT HE WANTED TO EXPRESS A SENSE OF REVERENCE FOR THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WOMEN. IN JANUARY OF THE SAME YEAR, DURING ANOTHER SHOW, MALE MODELS WORE OUTFITS WITH HOLES IN THE CROTCH AREA, WHICH LED TO A CONTROVERSY ABOUT OBSCENITY. EVENTUALLY, HE ACQUIRED THE NICKNAME &#39;DICK OWENS,&#39; BUT EVEN THEN, RICK OWENS EXPRESSED A NONCHALANT REACTION, STATING THAT NUDITY IS THE SIMPLEST AND MOST PRIMAL FORM OF EXPRESSION. WHEN HE HAD MALE AND FEMALE MODELS WEAR UNCONVENTIONAL HEADPIECES AS HAIRSTYLES, HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS INSPIRED BY LONG HAIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE &#39;HIPPIE STYLE&#39; AND WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF REBELLION AND SUBVERSION. INNOVATIVE CREATIVITY VS BIZARRE SHOWS, WHAT IS THE REAL STORY THAT RICK OWENS WANTS TO TELL? WHEN I MET HIM AT THE BOON THE SHOP GALLERY EVENT, I ASKED HIM TO DEFINE &#39;RICK OWENS CLOTHING.&#39; Q. WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE MESSAGE YOU WANT TO CONVEY THROUGH FASHION? A: IT&#39;S AN EMPATHETIC ALTERNATIVE. TODAY&#39;S CULTURE IS FILLED WITH EXCESSIVELY STRICT, NARROW, AND SOMETIMES CRUEL AESTHETIC STANDARDS. WHILE MY DESIGNS MAY NOT SATISFY EVERYONE, I HOPE THEY PROVIDE SOME ALTERNATIVE TO THE HOMOGENIZED NORMS IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY TODAY. ULTIMATELY, I WANT TO REVEAL THE ECCENTRIC TRAITS THAT RESIDE IN PEOPLE. EVERY PERSON HAS THEIR ECCENTRIC QUALITIES. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE UNIQUE, INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS. THIS IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT THE TOLERANCE THAT IS ESSENTIAL AS WE LIVE IN THE WORLD. I HOPE WE CAN ACCEPT AND EMBRACE OTHERS ENTIRELY WITHOUT HASTY JUDGMENT OR CONDEMNATION. Q. MANY OF YOUR DESIGNS ARE RADICAL AND UNCONVENTIONAL. A: OF COURSE, IT MAY BE SEEN AS BIZARRE, BUT I THINK TO SOME EXTENT I’VE SUCCEEDED IN CREATING DESIGNS THAT ARE ELEGANT AND CONVINCING ENOUGH FOR A PROMINENT KOREAN MEDIA OUTLET TO WANT TO INTERVIEW ME. (LAUGHS) Q. IS THERE A REASON YOU LIKE THE COLOR BLACK? A: BLACK IS INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC AND SOPHISTICATED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT&#39;S A VERY HUMBLE COLOR. IT HAS THE ABILITY TO GIVE OFF A VERY POLITE ATTITUDE. IT&#39;S A COLOR THAT ALLOWS OTHERS TO STAND OUT. IT&#39;S ALSO A COLOR THAT PROVIDES COMFORT FOR THE EYES IN A CHAOTIC, MESSY, AND COMPLICATED WORLD. Q. TO PULL OFF YOUR CLOTHES WELL, DO I NEED TO BE TALL AND SLIM LIKE A FASHION MODEL? A: MY MOTHER USED TO SAY THE SAME THING, AND I WOULD ALWAYS RESPOND LIKE THIS: MICHELE (MY WIFE) WEARS THEM JUST FINE TOO (LAUGHS) IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, IT IS COMMON THAT THE STYLES SHOWCASED ON THE RUNWAY ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS SOLD IN STORES. DURING FASHION CAMPAIGNS AND SHOWS, DESIGNERS OFTEN EXAGGERATE AND EMPHASIZE THE ASPECTS THEY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE SEASON. HOWEVER, THE CLOTHING AVAILABLE IN STORES IS TYPICALLY MORE REFINED AND PRACTICAL FOR EVERYDAY WEAR. IT&#39;S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT EVEN KOREAN CELEBRITIES LIKE G-DRAGON, SANDARA PARK, AND BTS&#39;S V ARE NOT AS TALL AS FOREIGN MODELS BUT ARE STILL KNOWN TO ENJOY WEARING RICK OWENS&#39; CLOTHING. Q. WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE WORDS? A: SOME OF MY FAVORITE WORDS ARE EMPATHY, EMBRACEMENT, LOVE, TENDERNESS, WARMTH, FAMILY, GARDEN, GRANDCHILDREN, CAKE, ESPRESSO, ME, LAVENDER, COASTLINE, NAP.&quot; (LAUGHS) WITH HIS LONG, BLACK HAIR AND BLACK LEATHER 4-INCH-HIGH HEELS, RICK OWENS CERTAINLY EMPHASIZES THE LOOK OF A &quot;DARK FASHION LORD.&quot; HOWEVER, WHEN YOU ACTUALLY MEET HIM, HE APPEARS TO BE MORE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER WHO LOVES ROMANCE. I UNDERSTAND THE FEELINGS OF HIS FOLLOWERS WHO LOVE HIS CLOTHING. AND RICK OWENS TRULY LOVES THE COLOR BLACK. DESPITE HIS SHORT VISIT TO KOREA, AFTER THE INTERVIEW, HE PERSONALLY VISITED A PHOTO EXHIBITION BY THE KOREAN PHOTOGRAPHER MIN BYUNG-HUN CALLED &#39;戒(계).&#39; MIN BYUNG-HUN IS A PHOTOGRAPHER SPECIALIZING IN UNIQUE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS WITH A DISTINCTIVE COLOR PALETTE KNOWN AS &#39;MIN BYUNG-HUN GREY.&#39; Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

FROM THERE, OWENS’S SUCCESS HAS ONLY CONTINUED TO GROW, AS HE HAS FOUND NEW WAYS TO PROVOKE THE FASHION WORLD WHILE ALSO TAPPING INTO TODAY’S YOUTH CULTURE. INTERSPERSED WITH IMAGERY FROM PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVITT, THIS PHYSICAL LOOKING GLASS INTO OWENS’S MIND EXPLORES HIS PERSPECTIVE ON VISUAL MEDIA. AHEAD OF THE BOOK’S LAUNCH, OWENS SPOKE WITH L’OFFICIEL FROM THE COMFORT OF HIS PARISIAN APARTMENT ABOUT HIS CREATIVE PROCESS AND THE LEGACY HE’S CREATED OVER NEARLY THREE DECADES. L’OFFICIEL: WHILE YOU ARE WORKING ON THE BOOK, DID YOU NOTICE ANY CHANGES IN YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS SINCE YOUR EARLY DAYS AS A DESIGNER? RICK OWENS: I DON’T THINK SO. MAYBE IN 10 YEARS, I’LL LOOK BACK ON IT AND I’LL SEE SOME KIND OF PATTERN OR A VARIATION, BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT’S SUCH A ROLLING-ALONG PROCESS THAT EVERY COLLECTION IS AN EVOLUTION OF THE ONE BEFORE IT. SO I DON’T REALLY SEE DIPS AND PEAKS; I’M JUST AT THE FRONT OF THE TRAIN. BUT I’M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PACE OF FASHION AT ALL, BECAUSE I LOVE IT. I WOULDN’T WANT IT ANY SLOWER BECAUSE IT GIVES ME A GREAT SENSE OF PURPOSE AND IT KEEPS A RHYTHM IN MY LIFE. HAVING DEADLINES, IT’S LIKE BIRTHDAYS AND ANNIVERSARIES—THEY MARK TIME. THE PERIOD IN BETWEEN EACH RUNWAY SHOW IS KIND OF LIKE A PUZZLE, BECAUSE I HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AND A CERTAIN BUDGET, AND I NEED TO USE THOSE RESOURCES IN THE SMARTEST WAY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SOMETHING COMPELLING. IF I HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD AND ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE HARD TO FOCUS. SO IT’S GREAT TO HAVE THOSE PARAMETERS AND THOSE BOUNDARIES TO KEEP [ME] IN LINE. L’O: YOU SAID THAT EVERY COLLECTION IS AN EVOLUTION OF THE ONE BEFORE IT. HOW DO YOU TAKE A COLLECTION AND WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER? RO: WELL, IF I KNEW THE RECIPE, I WOULD SELL IT AND MAYBE MAKE MORE MONEY THAN I DO NOW. CLOTHES THEMSELVES ARE SUCH A STRONG FORM OF COMMUNICATION. THEY’RE LIKE THE FIRST METHOD OF COMMUNICATION WHEN WE CONFRONT SOMEBODY. CLOTHES AND PERSONAL ADORNMENT HAVE BEEN USED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME TO SIGNIFY OUR CONNECTION TO HUMANITY OR TO SIGNIFY POWER OR STATUS; TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHO WE ARE OR WHO WE WANT TO BE.!EN ON TOP OF THAT, THERE’S MY ROLE, SOMEBODY WHO CREATES. LIKE A WRITER OR AN ARTIST, YOU CREATE AS A MEANS TO COMMUNICATE. SO I’M COMMUNICATING ABOUT COMMUNICATING, AND COMMUNICATION IS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE. THAT’S WHAT WE ALL NEED THE MOST. THAT’S WHAT WE’RE HERE TO DO. WE WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR LOVED ONES; WE WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PEOPLE. WE WANT TO BE LISTENED TO BY PEOPLE AROUND US, BY OUR CHILDREN. AND THAT’S WHAT WE WANT THE MOST, UNTIL WE DIE. I HAVE BEEN VALIDATED SO MUCH MORE THAN I EVER FANTASIZED. I FEEL LIKE I’VE BEEN HEARD; I’VE BEEN LISTENED TO IN SUCH A HUGE, PROFOUND WAY. I’M NOT REALLY GOING ANYWHERE WITH THAT. IT WAS AN OBSERVATION. L’O: WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR WORK? RO: I WANTED TO REACT AGAINST BIGOTRY. WE CAN SEE THIS ONLINE; WE CAN SEE JUDGMENT, MORALISTIC JUDGMENT, AND SUPERIOR JUDGMENT. I CONFRONTED THAT A LOT IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS YOUNG, AND I ALWAYS RESENTED IT SO PROFOUNDLY. STANDARDS OF BEAUTY CAN BE VERY RIGID AND THEY CAN BE CRUEL BECAUSE NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE CAN REACH THOSE STANDARDS. SO WHAT I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IS PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE: A WORLD WHERE THERE ARE OTHER VALUES THAT AREN’T SO MUCH ABOUT PROMOTING CLICHÉS OR PROMOTING ENVY AND STATUS SYMBOLS. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT I KIND OF DID SUCH A GOOD JOB AT IT THAT I CREATED A THING THAT BECAME A WALL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE THE RICK OWENS THING AND THEY SAY, “OH, THAT’S TOO MUCH FOR ME. I WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THAT,” WHEN ORIGINALLY THE INTENT WAS TO CREATE [THE EXACT OPPOSITE]. I MEAN, THAT’S JUST INEVITABLE I GUESS. EVERY UTOPIAN URGE USUALLY ENDS UP BECOMING CORRUPTED SOMEHOW, AND THAT’S JUST THE WAY THAT LIFE WORKS. BUT THAT WAS ALWAYS MY BIGGEST URGE, TO CELEBRATE THE FREAK IN ALL OF US AND TO LIBERATE THAT. WHEN I WAS A KID, IN MY SMALL TOWN IN CALIFORNIA, THERE WAS A SALE IN THE BASEMENT OF THE CHIEF DEPARTMENT STORE, AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW THE COVER OF DAVID BOWIE’S DIAMOND DOGS. AND THAT WAS IN THE ‘70S. I SAW THIS COVER, AND IT MADE ME SO NERVOUS BECAUSE IT WAS PRESSING ALL OF THE BUTTONS OF EVERYTHING THAT I’D EVER WANTED. THERE WAS GLAMOUR, BUT IT WAS KIND OF A SLEAZY GLAMOUR. THERE WAS HOMOEROTICISM AND THERE WAS SEXUAL AMBIGUITY, AND I WAS DISTURBED, DEEPLY DISTURBED, BUT IT WAS SO LIBERATING. AND IF I CAN DO THAT TO SOME KID IN A SMALL TOWN, THAT WOULD BE A THRILL. THAT’S WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO. I WOULD LOVE TO LIBERATE PEOPLE FROM FEELING THAT THEY NEED TO CONFORM TO CERTAIN STANDARDS. SO THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DRIVE AND TO DO IT IN A CONVINCING, COMPELLING, SOPHISTICATED WAY. L’O: THIS IDEA OF FREEDOM AND LIBERATING PEOPLE, IT’S SOMETHING THAT YOU APPLY IN FASHION, BUT ALSO IN YOUR OTHER VISUAL WORKS LIKE ART OR DESIGN. YOU’VE CREATED YOUR OWN RICK OWENS UNIVERSE. RO: WELL, I HAVEN’T DONE PERFUME OR MAKEUP YET. L’O: WOULD YOU LIKE TO? RO: THAT WOULD BE NICE TO DO. BUT THAT’S A TRICKY WORLD TO ENTER BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS. AND IF YOU DON’T SUCCEED THE FIRST TIME, IT’S VERY DAMAGING. AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER FACTORS; YOU HAVE TO JOIN POWERFUL PARTNERS BECAUSE IT IS SO RUTHLESSLY COMPETITIVE. BUT IT’S NOT LIKE A DREAM OF MINE TO ENTER PERFUME AND MAKEUP BECAUSE MAYBE [I JUST DON’T BELONG IN] THAT WORLD. AND THAT’S FINE, BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH A GREAT LIFE ANYWAY. I DON’T REALLY NEED TO PUSH MYSELF INTO AN ARENA WHERE I DON’T BELONG, BECAUSE MY IDEAS WOULDN’T BE AS POPULAR AS THEY NEED TO BE TO COMPETE. [BEAUTY] IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF COMPETITION THAN FASHION. IT’S HARDER. IT’S WAY MORE NARROW. I’VE BEEN THINKING, I DON’T REALLY LIKE TO TRAVEL THAT MUCH, BECAUSE THE EFFORT OF TRAVELING IS USUALLY MORE UNPLEASANT THAN WHAT IT’S WORTH TO ARRIVE. I LIVE IN PARIS AND VENICE AND THEY’RE SO MAGICAL. I FEEL LIKE I COULD SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE JUST EXPLORING THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN AIRPORTS. THE THING ABOUT AIRPORTS IS THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO GO THROUGH THOSE DUTY-FREE SHOPS THAT ASSAULT YOU WITH A VERY SPECIFIC KIND OF BEAUTY STANDARD, ASPIRATIONAL VALUE SYSTEM, AND SEXUALITY AND BODY IMAGE. AND I RESENT THAT. AND THIS IS ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT’S NOT THE BIG BRANDS THAT ARE FORCING THIS ON US—THIS IS WHAT CONSUMERS WANT. THIS IS WHAT THE WORLD WANTS. THESE ARE THE STANDARDS THAT THEY’VE ALL AGREED ON, AND IT’S VERY RIGID. IT JUST REMINDS ME THAT I JUST NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING ELSE. L’O: YOU HAVE A DEEP CONNECTION WITH VENICE, EVEN THOUGH IT’S NOT THE OBVIOUS CHOICE OF RESIDENCE FOR A DESIGNER. WHAT IS IT ABOUT VENICE THAT DRAWS YOU IN? RO: WELL, PRACTICALITY. IT’S TWO HOURS AWAY FROM THE FACTORY, AND I ENDED UP AT THE FACTORY, NOT BECAUSE I CHOSE IT, BUT BECAUSE THEY CHOSE ME. WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT, I WAS LOOKING TO LICENSE MY COLLECTION, AND I WAS TRAVELING TO DIFFERENT SMALL FACTORIES THAT MIGHT ACCEPT DOING A LICENSE WITH ME. AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT ACCEPTED. I JUST GREW UP THERE. I ENDED UP BUYING THE FACTORY ONCE WE’D GROWN BIG ENOUGH. VENICE WAS THE CLOSEST MAGICAL SPOT, BUT IT HAS ALWAYS HELD SO MUCH ALLURE FOR ME. IT IS THE MOST IMPROBABLE, IMPRACTICAL CITY EVER, WHICH MAKES ME LOVE IT, BECAUSE IT BREAKS ALL OF THE RULES. THERE’S AN EXTRAVAGANCE AND A FOLLY TO IT THAT I JUST LOVE. NOT ONLY IS IT MAGICAL, IT’S ACTUALLY AN ART HUB. WITH THE BIENNALE AND THE MUSEUMS THAT HAD BEEN SET UP THERE, IT’S AN IMPORTANT PLACE FOR CONTEMPORARY ART AT THE SAME TIME AS BEING THIS COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL PIECE OF CAKE. L’O: WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ART? RO: I’M A FAN. I’M NOT A CONNOISSEUR, BUT IT’S THE CLOSEST THING TO SPIRITUALITY THAT I KNOW OF FROM DAY TO DAY. I LIVE IN PLACE DE LA CONCORDE IN PARIS. AND SO I CAN JUST WALK THROUGH THE TUILERIES GARDEN TO THE LOUVRE AND IT CAN BE PART OF MY DAY. AND I LOVE THAT. I LOVE HAVING THAT ACCESS TO A GRAND CATHEDRAL OF ART. WHEN YOU GO TO THE LOUVRE, IT HAS EVERYTHING: LIFE, DEATH, LUST, CORRUPTION, WAR, BLOOD, ALL OF THE ART THAT WAS STOLEN FROM OTHER PEOPLE, AND THE LUST OF THINGS THAT ARE PORTRAYED THAT WENT ON BEHIND THE SCENES. IT’S JUST THIS CARNAL ORGY. IT’S SO SOPHISTICATED, BUT IT’S SO PRIMITIVE AT THE SAME TIME. IT’S A CATHEDRAL TO LIFE. SO THAT’S OLD ART, BUT THEN THERE’S CONTEMPORARY ART, WHICH IS NEW LIFE AND NEW URGES AND NEW AMBITIONS AND EMOTIONS. IT’S THRILLING. L’O: HOW DO YOU APPROACH AN IDEA AND TRANSFORM IT INTO A RUNWAY COLLECTION? RO: I DON’T KNOW HOW THIS EXPRESSES ITSELF IN A BLACK SKIRT THAT YOU SEE ON SALE IN A DEPARTMENT STORE, BUT BEHIND EVERY COLLECTION, WHAT I’M THINKING ABOUT IS ALL OF THE ANXIETIES AND THE ELATIONS AND THE TRIBULATIONS THAT ALL OF US ARE PROCESSING AND GOING THROUGH. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MY CLOTHES BEING DARK. I THINK, HOW CAN YOU NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE REAL WORLD? THERE ARE DESIGNERS WHO ARE OBLIVIOUS AND WHO PRESENT TOTAL DISNEYLAND ESCAPISM. AND THAT’S FINE. IF PEOPLE WANT THAT, THAT’S A TOTALLY VALID CHOICE. I DON’T INVALIDATE IT, BUT I PREFER SOMETHING THAT’S A LITTLE BIT MORE HONEST. WHEN I TALK ABOUT PRIMAL URGES, THOSE ARE HONEST URGES THAT ALL OF US SHARE, AND TO TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN I AM PRESENTING OR MAKING THINGS IS THE MOST HONEST PROCESSING THAT I CAN DO. L’O: YOUR WORK HAS OFTEN BEEN CALLED PROVOCATIVE BY THOSE WITHIN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COMES WITH INSTINCT? RO: I PUT OUT THERE WHAT I WANT TO SEE. I WANT TO BE SHOCKED. I WANT TO BE SURPRISED. I WANT TO BE PROVOKED. I WANT TO BE STIMULATED. I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING THAT PUSHES THINGS. THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO SEE. SO I JUST DO STUFF THAT I WANT TO SEE. L’O: IN PREVIOUS COLLECTIONS, THERE HAVE BEEN REFERENCES TO EGYPT, THE ‘70S, AND OTHER PERIODS IN HISTORY. HOW DOES THE PAST INSPIRE YOU? RO: I LIVE IN THE PAST FOR SURE. I THINK IT’S BECAUSE I LIKE SEEING WHAT HAPPENS FROM POINT A TO POINT B. FOR INSTANCE, I PREFER DEAD ARTISTS BECAUSE I LIKE TO SEE HOW THEY EVOLVED FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. WITH NEW ARTISTS, I CAN’T SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE YET. AND THEY MIGHT CHANGE. THEY MIGHT GOIN A WEIRD DIRECTION OR SOMETHING. I CAN’T REALLY COMMIT, BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH EXAMPLES OF OLD DEAD ARTISTS THAT HAVE CREATED A CONVINCING MONUMENT, AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I LOOK TO BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE HOW THEY DID IT. I READ BIOGRAPHIES OF ARTISTS AND CREATORS BECAUSE I’M CURIOUS AND PROBABLY REASSURED BY HOW MESSY THEY WERE. I JUST LIKE SEEING HOW AN AESTHETIC MONUMENT IS MADE BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT I’D LIKE TO DO. L’O: LOOKING BACK AT YOUR CAREER, WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR MOST CHALLENGING MOMENT? RO: I GUESS STARTING TO DO RUNWAY SHOWS, BECAUSE I’D NEVER REALLY CONSIDERED DOING THEM. I HAD ONLY EVER SOLD TO STORES ON MY OWN. COMING FROM LA, I HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN TO A RUNWAY SHOW. AMERICAN VOGUE REACHED OUT AND OFFERED TO SPONSOR A SHOW FOR ME. THAT KIND OF ENDORSEMENT WAS A HUGE THING, BUT I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE I KNEW THAT MY AESTHETIC WAS VERY SOFT AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH IMPACT FOR RUNWAYS. THE FIRST RUNWAY WOULD BE NICE, BUT IF IT DIDN’T REALLY CHANGE OR EVOLVE, I WOULDN’T BE EXCITING ENOUGH FOR RUNWAY SHOWS FOR VERY LONG. SO THAT FELT THREATENING, AND THAT WASN’T PART OF MY PERSONALITY, TO BE A PERFORMER. I HADN’T EVER REALLY CONSIDERED IT. BUT ANYWAY, I THOUGHT, WELL, I HAVE TO DO THIS. SO I DID IT. AT THE BEGINNING, I WASN’T GREAT. I HAD A LOT TO LEARN, AND I COULD HAVE REALLY FUCKED IT UP. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN BETTER OR I COULD HAVE GOTTEN WORSE. LUCKILY, I GOT BETTER. WHAT WAS FUNNY IS THAT GRADUALLY, I STARTED LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DO IT, AND THEN I STARTED HAVING FUN. THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I WAS DOING THESE SPECTACLES, AND I REALLY STARTED ENJOYING IT. IT JUST TOOK ME A WHILE TO LEARN.

WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON? THEY SCULPT THEIR MATERIALS -HERE USING DOWN AND NYLON – AND HAVE THE SAME CONCEPTION OF CLOTHING, WHICH MUST BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF THE WORLD BUT ALSO ELEGANT AND ECO-RESPONSIBLE. MONCLER HAS MADE ITS DOWN JACKETS BOTH ICONIC AND LUXURIOUS. RICK OWENS, THE FASHION PHILOSOPHER, WORKS THROUGH HIS CREATIONS TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN STRICTLY FUNCTIONAL AND RIGOROUS SPECTACULAR. TO CREATE THIS SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN THE AVANT-GARDE DESIGNER AND THE MONCLER HOUSE, IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTALS: USING DOWN AS THE MAIN ELEMENT OF THE COLLECTION. THE RESULT OF THIS COLLABORATION, AVAILABLE STARTING NOVEMBER 30TH, IS AN EXPLOSION MADE UP OF EXUBERANT AND FEATHER-LIGHT PIECES, TUNICS WITH XXL SLEEVES, QUILTED BOLERO JACKETS ENHANCED BY NON-COLORS, MATTE BLACK, GRAYS, AND DUST. “TO ME, MONCLER REPRESENTS INSULATION, PROTECTION, AND AT THE SAME TIME MOMENTUM,” SAYS RICK OWENS, “AND I FOUND MYSELF IN HARMONY WITH THESE ASPECTS.” MADAME FIGARO: “DOES THIS SECOND COLLABORATION WITH MONCLER ALLOW YOU TO EXPLORE NEW TECHNIQUES? RICK OWENS: OF COURSE. IT STIMULATES THE IMAGINATION AND ALLOWS RISK-TAKING IN CREATING NEW MATERIALS, DESIGNS, AND COMMUNICATION TOOLS TO RAISE AWARENESS AMONG OTHER FASHION COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, LAST FEBRUARY, IN LONDON, AS A PART OF MONCLER&#39;S “THE ART OF GENIUS” EVENT, I SHOWCASED AN AESTHETIC BUBBLE, A SORT OF SOUNDPROOF CAPSULE DESIGNED FOR ANYONE. MY COLLECTION OFFERS A WARDROBE FOR LIVING IN THIS BUBBLE AS WELL AS OUTSIDE OF IT. WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU CREATED THIS COLLECTION? IN A MOMENT OF SWEETNESS IN A WORLD OF TEARS AND VIOLENCE WHAT MATTERS TO YOU, THE COMFORT OF CLOTHES AND THEIR AESTHETICS OR THE MANUFACTURING ETHICS? I LIKE COMFORT, OF COURSE, BUT THIS REQUIRES US TO BE AWARE OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE HAVE A DUTY OF RESPECT TO OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS AND THE PLANET AND A COMMITMENT TO DIGNITY. YOUR LATEST PERSONAL COLLECTION SEEMED MORE RADICAL. ARE YOU A PESSIMIST? REALISTIC. I SEE CLEARLY WHAT THE HUMAN CONDITION IS, FULL OF SOUND AND FURY. SOME DESIGNERS OFFER ESCAPES FROM REALITY. I LIKE THE REAL, THE HARD, AND THE BLOODY. WHY DID YOU BECOME A FASHION DESIGNER? TO OFFER OTHER CHOICES TO THOSE WHO DO NOT RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES IN THE CODES PROPOSED TODAY, WHICH ARE RIGID, NARROW, AND SOMETIMES CRUEL. I RESPECT THE PRINCIPLES THAT DEFINE “CLASSIC BEAUTY,” BUT I TRY TO MAKE THEM FLEXIBLE. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT MY WORK IS ALIENATING… OTHERS, ON THE CONTRARY, WILL FIND IT LIBERATING. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF FASHION? FASHION IS COMMUNICATION. IT’S A WAY OF SHOWING OTHERS WHAT WE ARE. AND TO OTHERS WHO WE ARE. I EXPRESS MYSELF THROUGH MY COLLECTIONS AND RECEIVE MANY MORE SIGNALS OF SUPPORT FROM OTHER WORLDS. SO, I IMAGINE I’M ON THE RIGHT PATH.

HOWEVER, HE HAS SINCE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. THE CALIFORNIAN DESIGNER, WHO NOW RESIDES IN PARIS, HAS BEEN DISRUPTING THE FASHION INDUSTRY SINCE 1994 WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL AND EDGY DESIGNS. THIS STYLE, ACCORDING TO SOME, IS IDEALLY UNITED WITH THE CONCEPTUAL JAPANESE-ISMS OF THE MIYAKE-KAWAKUBO-YAMAMOTO TRIAD, AND NOW, OWENS SEEMS TO HAVE CULTIVATED A NEW PASSION FOR PARTNERSHIPS, FROM ADIDAS, CONVERSE, BIRKENSTOCK, AND MONCLER. HE’S RECENTLY DESIGNED GARMENTS FOR THE LATTER THAT FUSE HIS ARTISTIC, SENSUAL, AND DARK, ALMOST GOTHIC SENSIBILITY WITH THE ITALIAN BRAND&#39;S ICONIC DOWN JACKETS. WE SPOKE TO OWENS ABOUT IT FROM HIS HOME IN PARIS, WHERE HE SAT SIFTING THROUGH FABRICS FOR AN UPCOMING COLLECTION. HE ARRIVES FROM THE GARDEN, APOLOGIZING FOR BEING LATE BECAUSE HE WAS &quot;COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN WORK,&quot; SAYING HE LOST TRACK OF TIME. LET&#39;S START WITH HIS RADICAL CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD COLLABORATIONS, WHICH HE HAS BECOME A KING IN.... &quot;LET&#39;S NOT EXAGGERATE; I DON&#39;T THINK I&#39;M THE KING OF ANYTHING. BUT YES, I HAVE FOUND THAT I LIKE THEM. MAYBE A WHILE AGO, I WAS TOO SUSPICIOUS OF THEM. I WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WERE JUST BEING USED FOR HYPE, AND SUBCONSCIOUSLY, I ALSO FELT THAT MY IDENTITY WAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AND STABLE ENOUGH, SO I DIDN&#39;T WANT IT TO BE DISTORTED OR CONFUSED WITH THAT OF OTHER COMPANIES. BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING IS PRETTY CLEAR AND DEFINED. THE PARTNERSHIPS DON’T DISTORT THE FORCE OF WHAT I HAVE CONSTRUCTED; THEY STRENGTHEN IT INSTEAD.&quot; SO, HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THEM? &quot;AS A FUN SURPRISE. WHEN YOU LEARN ABOUT A NEW COLLABORATION, IT&#39;S KIND OF LIKE DISCOVERING A NEW PIECE OF GOSSIP. EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHO&#39;S SLEEPING WITH WHOM, AND THE MEETING BETWEEN TWO BRANDS IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AFTER ALL. WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE, I&#39;VE LEARNED TO ENJOY THROWING MYSELF INTO PROJECTS BECAUSE IT&#39;S INTERESTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW OTHERS WORK. IT&#39;S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET NEW PEOPLE. I THINK IT’S CRUCIAL THAT COLLABORATIONS DON’T SEEM &#39;DESPERATE&#39; OR LIKE PRETEXTS FOR ATTENTION, BUT INSTEAD MAKE SENSE AND APPEAR LOGICAL AND JOYFUL.&quot; WAS THIS THE CASE WITH MONCLER? &quot;OF COURSE. MONCLER IS A BRAND ALWAYS WILLING TO EXPLORE AND COMMUNICATE, AND APPAREL IS A MEDIUM THAT FULLY INCORPORATES THIS. EVERYONE AT MONCLER HAS AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT AND IS EXCITED TO EXPLORE EVERY ASPECT. WE HAD SOME BOLD IDEAS, AND THE COMPANY DIDN&#39;T HESITATE TO APPROVE AND SUPPORT THEM.&quot; THERE WAS A CUSTOMIZED BUS TOUR TO CELEBRATE THE FIRST COLLABORATION IN 2020. &quot;YES, VERY OFTEN I HAVE IDEAS THAT MAY BE STALLED FOR A WHILE BEFORE BEING REALIZED,&quot; HE SAYS. “I’LL EXPLAIN: IT HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLICATED FOR MY PARENTS TO TRAVEL TO EUROPE, AND I HAD NOT BEEN TO THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS. HOWEVER, I FELT I SHOULD GO, SO I ASKED MYSELF HOW TO MAKE THIS OCCASION UNFORGETTABLE. THAT&#39;S WHEN I THOUGHT OF A CUSTOMIZED BUS TOUR THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO LIVE IN MY OWN LITTLE BUBBLE WHEN I WAS MOVING AROUND THE STATES. COINCIDENCE WOULD HAVE IT THAT THE CONTACT WITH MONCLER HAPPENED AROUND THE SAME TIME, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD PRESENT IT TO THEM AND COMBINE THE TWO IDEAS. THEY WERE DELIGHTED, AND SO WE DID THE TOUR WITH THEM.&quot; THE LINE BETWEEN HIS FASHION AND CONCEPTUAL ART IS VERY THIN. YOUR FASHION SHOWS AREN’T JUST FASHION SHOWS, BUT PERFORMANCES… &quot;A KEY FIGURE IN MY INSPIRATION WAS THE GERMAN ARTIST, JOSEPH BEUYS. IN 1974, HE LEFT GERMANY AND LANDED AT JFK. THERE, THEY WRAPPED HIM IN FELT AND PUT HIM IN AN AMBULANCE, WITH WHICH HE WAS SHIPPED TO A NEW YORK GALLERY WHERE HE LIVED FOR THREE DAYS IN A ROOM WITH A COYOTE. THIS PERFORMANCE TITLED I LIKE AMERICA AND AMERICA LIKES ME WAS ABOUT MEETING AND SHARING SPACE WITH A WILD ANIMAL. EVENTUALLY, HE WAS PUT BACK IN THE AMBULANCE, TAKEN BACK TO THE AIRPORT, AND BACK TO GERMANY. IT WAS HIS ONLY EXPERIENCE IN THE UNITED STATES. ITS ROMANCE, DRAMA, STRANGENESS, ISOLATION, AND INTROSPECTION HAVE ALWAYS STRUCK ME. SO, I HAVE TRIED TO USE FELT IN ALL ITS FORMS: AS INSULATION FOR CLOTHING, CARPETS, UPHOLSTERY, OR CURTAINS. MAKING A PROTECTIVE SHELL, A FILTER WITH THE WORLD, HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN AMBITION OF MINE.&quot; KIND OF LIKE THE SLEEPING POD YOU MADE FOR MONCLER&#39;S THE ART OF GENIUS, PRESENTED AT LONDON FASHION WEEK IN FEBRUARY 2023. &quot;EXACTLY. AT ONE POINT, I CONSIDERED GETTING AN APARTMENT IN NEW YORK, BUT I&#39;M TOO USED TO MY PEACE HERE IN PARIS. IF THERE&#39;S ONE THING I DON&#39;T LIKE IN THE AMERICAN METROPOLIS, IT&#39;S THE CONSTANT ENERGY THAT YOU BREATHE, WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE LOVES THE CITY: TO ME, IT FEELS ARTIFICIAL. I THOUGHT I&#39;D NEED ANOTHER SOLUTION TO DEAL WITH THAT FRENZY IMBUED WITH AMBITION, NECESSITY, AND COMPETITION. SO, I DESIGNED A SOUNDPROOF PANIC ROOM THAT WOULD PROVIDE PEACE OF MIND TO ESTRANGE ONESELF FROM THE SURROUNDING CHAOS, AND WITH IT, I CONCEIVED AN ENTIRE WARDROBE TO LIVE IN. WHEN I ENGAGE IN PROJECTS LIKE THIS, I BUILD A COMPLETE AESTHETIC: FROM THE CLOTHES TO THE SOCKS, FROM THE LIGHT SWITCHES TO THE ENTIRE SPACE, EVERYTHING IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A LIFE-LIKE EXPERIENCE.&quot; SO, HOW DOES YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS UNFOLD?. “THERE ARE SO MANY INFLUENCES AND SUGGESTIONS COMING FROM THE WORLD. BUT THAT&#39;S EXACTLY WHY SOMETIMES YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND ASK YOURSELF: WHAT DO I, MYSELF, WANT TO SEE? WHAT DO I DESIRE? WHAT DO I WANT TO WEAR? BECAUSE WHEN I ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, AND I COME UP WITH SOMETHING, IT IS USUALLY AUTHENTIC. IF I WANT IT, OTHER PEOPLE PROBABLY WANT IT TOO. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT RARELY WORKS IF I TRY TO PLEASE OTHERS BECAUSE IT&#39;S NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND OTHERS FULLY.” HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR COLLECTIONS ARE UNDERSTOOD? “I&#39;M NOT YET AWARE OF WHERE I AM OR WHAT MY POSITION IN THE WORLD IS. A FEW YEARS AGO, I RECEIVED A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE CFDA, THE COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA, AND IT WAS TOTALLY OUT OF THE BLUE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WEREN&#39;T EVEN AWARE OF MY EXISTENCE. I&#39;VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE AN OUTSIDER, SOMEONE WHO HAS GONE A LONG WAY PARALLEL TO THE &quot;SYSTEM,&quot; AND I DIDN&#39;T THINK I WOULD EVER BE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF IT. IT WAS A HUGE SURPRISE.&quot; YOU’VE BEEN HONEST ABOUT YOUR PERCEPTION OF THE STANDARDS OF WHAT IS CALLED &quot;CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY.&quot; DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THESE STANDARDS HAVE REALLY CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS OR THAT THE WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT THEM HAS REMAINED SUPERFICIAL? &quot;NO, I DON&#39;T THINK THEY WILL EVER CHANGE. THERE ARE STANDARDS OF BEAUTY AND GRACE TO WHICH PEOPLE WILL BE FOREVER BOUND. I LIKE TO PROPOSE OTHER ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR THOSE WHO DON&#39;T FIT INTO THAT. I THINK MY CONTRIBUTION MAY BE LIMITED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THOSE STANDARDS CONTINUE TO BE RIGID, NARROW, AND CRUEL, BUT THAT&#39;S OKAY BECAUSE LIFE IS NOT FAIR. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE BEAUTIFUL TO CONVENTIONAL STANDARDS. BUT YOU CHOOSE TO BECOME CONFIDENT.&quot; ON THE OTHER HAND, DO YOU THINK ONE IS BORN CREATIVE? &quot;I THINK SO. BUT IT ALSO DEPENDS A LOT ON THE WAY YOU GROW UP. IF, AS A KID, YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME MINDING YOUR OWN BUSINESS INSTEAD OF PLAYING WITH OTHERS AND GETTING MUDDY, THERE&#39;S A CHANCE THAT YOU COME UP WITH IDEAS OF WHAT FUN IS THAT MAYBE DIDN&#39;T EXIST BEFORE. YOU BECOME MORE CREATIVE AND LESS COMPLIANT. I FEEL LIKE THAT&#39;S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I THINK THAT&#39;S WHAT ENDOWED ME WITH INVENTIVENESS.&quot; DO YOU SOMETIMES FIND YOURSELF DAYDREAMING? IS THERE A CURRENT FANTASY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH OUR READERS? &quot;I DAYDREAM A LOT. I ADMIT THAT I CONSIDER IT A STRENGTH. I MAKE AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT THE CLOUDS FROM THE GARDEN OR WATCH BIRDS ON THE BEACH. I SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT THE BEACH: CONNECTING WITH THE SEA IS VERY FULFILLING. BUT I AM ALSO PRACTICAL, AND I DON&#39;T FANTASIZE MUCH. FOR EXAMPLE, I NEVER IMAGINED DOING FASHION SHOWS; IT SIMPLY HAPPENED. AND WHEN I DID, I WASN’T EXPECTING MY WORK TO BE APPRECIATED, AND I WAS SURPRISED WHEN IT WAS. I AM ALSO NOT INTERESTED IN ACQUISITION, SO I DON&#39;T FANTASIZE ABOUT OWNING THINGS. BUT THERE IS ONE THING: I THINK I HAVE FANTASIES ABOUT CONTROL. I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE IN ORDER. EXERCISING HAS ALWAYS HELPED ME CONTROL MY BODY, AND I FIND IT A SATISFYING PRACTICE EVEN THOUGH, IN REALITY, I KNOW IT&#39;S AN ILLUSION, YET ANOTHER FANTASY TO PLAY WITH. AND IN THE END, I’M OKAY WITH THAT.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT; THERE IS NO NEED TO CATER TO OTHERS. IN TODAY&#39;S FLEETING WORLD, RICK OWENS, WHO WAS INITIALLY SEEN AS A FREAK, HAS BECOME THE FASHION INDUSTRY&#39;S MOST BELOVED AND TIMELESS DESIGNER. IN OCTOBER, WHILE WAITING FOR RICK OWENS&#39;S REPLY, I LEARNED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, WERE VISITING TOKYO AND SEOUL. THEY HOSTED A RAVE IN TOKYO WITH PERFORMANCES BY DJ YOUSUKE YUKIMATSU, RYOJI IKEDA, AND THE FECAL MATTER DUO... IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAVE, MICHÈLE LAMY RODE A WHITE HORSE LIKE A PRIESTESS, WITH RICK OWENS WALKING BESIDE HER IN KISS BOOTS AND CALMLY HOLDING THE HORSE. A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT CAPTURED THE UNUSUAL SIGHT DURING THE DARK PARTY. THAT NIGHT, ALL THE GUESTS WORE RICK OWENS&#39;S CLOTHES FROM HEAD TO TOE (THE NEW YORK TIMES ONCE DESCRIBED THEM AS SOME KIND OF ALIEN), AND WE’RE ONCE AGAIN SURRENDERED TO THE LORD OF DARKNESS FOREVER. FOR RICK OWENS&#39;S FOLLOWERS, HE IS FAR MORE THAN FASHION; IT IS BELIEF. ASIDE FROM FASHION OR RUNWAY SHOWS. THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THING ABOUT RICK OWENS IS THAT HE HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONG SENSE OF BELONGING FOR NICHE, NON-MAINSTREAM, HETEROGENEOUS, AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS. HE SAID, &quot;TELLING PEOPLE THAT &#39;THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE CHOICES&#39; HAS ALWAYS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MY DESIGN PROCESS. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE BEAUTIFUL ACCORDING TO TYPICAL NORMS. AFTER ALL, THE STANDARD OF BEAUTY IS A BIT CRUEL AND NARROW.” HERE, PEOPLE CAN TAKE OFF THEIR DISGUISES OR EVEN WEAR ARMOR. RICK ACCEPTS THEM FOR THEMSELVES AND THE APPEARANCE THEY WANT TO PROJECT - EVEN IF IT IS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE PUBLIC, IT IS STILL REAL AND MOVING. AN OUTLIER BORN IN A TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC FAMILY RICK OWENS WAS BORN A DEVIANT IN A HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC FAMILY IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA. HIS FATHER WAS A SOCIAL WORKER, AND HIS MOTHER WAS A TEACHER. HE ONCE DESCRIBED HIS CHILDHOOD, SAYING: &quot;AS A CALIFORNIA BOY, I WAS VERY SENSITIVE AND FEMININE.&quot; NON-TRADITIONAL AND GAY, EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM SEEMED TO BE A SIN IN THIS FAMILY. HIS FATHER TRIED TO KEEP HIM AT HOME WITHOUT TELEVISION OR METAL MUSIC; NO ADULTS WOULD LISTEN. &quot;I WAS FORCED TO GIVE IN AND PRETEND TO BE MYSELF IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE WAY. I TOLD MYSELF THAT I HAD TO BECOME MANLY,” HE SAID. “YOU HAVE TO TOUGHEN UP.&quot; AS A CHILD, RICK ACCUMULATED REBELLIOUS ANGER TOWARD THE WORLD AND WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE WORLD AROUND HIM AND HIS EXTREMELY CONTROLLING FATHER. HIS DEPRESSION SEEMED TO FIND AN OUTLET AFTER HE WENT TO LOS ANGELES TO ATTEND OTIS ART HIGH SCHOOL. &quot;AS SOON AS I ENTERED AN ART SCHOOL IN A BIG CITY, I BECAME EVEN MORE CONFIDENT.&quot; HE ADMIRED ARTISTS SUCH AS JOSEPH BEUYS AND JULIAN SCHNABEL. HE STUDIED PAINTING AND, LATER, THOUGHT HE WAS NOT TALENTED ENOUGH AND SWITCHED TO ENTER A TRADE SCHOOL TO LEARN PATTERN AND GARMENT MAKING. AFTER GRADUATION, HE JOINED A HIGH-END IMITATION CLOTHING COMPANY AND COPIED BIG-NAME DESIGNS ALL DAY. AFTER GETTING OFF WORK, HE DRANK, TOOK DRUGS, AND HAD SEX IN BDSM BARS, LEADING A RIDICULOUS LIFE. HE ONCE EXPLAINED: &quot;TO PUT IT SIMPLY, IT MEANS WANDERING ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY, A FRINGE WORLD BASED ON THE LOWEST SENSES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS FULL OF AIDS, DRUGS, AND ALL KINDS OF DANGERS.&quot; &quot;THE REASON WHY I REMEMBER IT SO CLEARLY IS BECAUSE I ENJOYED THIS NEAR-DEATH LIFESTYLE...&quot; HOWEVER, IN THESE VIOLENT AND DECADENT DAYS, RICK OWENS UNEXPECTEDLY MET THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE, MUSE, AND BUSINESS PARTNER, A WOMAN HE WAS WILLING TO BE BURIED WITH-- MICHÈLE LAMY. BEFORE HE MET MICHÈLE LAMY, WHO WAS 18 YEARS OLDER, RICK ONLY HAD BOYFRIENDS. THROUGH HIS THEN-BOYFRIEND (DRAMATICALLY, WHO WAS ALSO NAMED RICK), HE WENT TO WORK FOR MICHÈLE LAMY&#39;S CLOTHING BRAND. NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE A NEW JOB, A NEW LOVER, AND A COMPATIBLE COUPLE. HE MOVED ON TO FOUNDING A BRAND UNDER HIS NAME IN 1994. YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY. THE TORCH THAT BURNS THE FASHION APOCALYPSE INITIALLY, RICK OWENS WAS SPONSORED BY VOGUE FOR HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE 2002 SPRING/SUMMER NEW YORK FASHION WEEK DUE TO THE APPRECIATION OF ANNA WINTOUR. HOWEVER, THE INDUSTRY REGARDED THIS OIL-STAINED, UNDERGROUND DARK AESTHETIC AS AN OUTLIER. &quot;IN NEW YORK AT THE TIME, WHAT I WAS DOING WAS MARGINALIZED AND CONSIDERED A FREAK SHOW.&quot; IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR, RICK AND MICHÈLE SETTLED IN PARIS, AND THEN THEY DROPPED THE MOST CRAZY AND DEVASTATING SHOCK BOMB ON THE FASHION INDUSTRY. IMAGINE THE ENERGY OF THE JAPANESE COMIC &quot;AKIRA&quot; THAT TRIGGERED THE TOKYO EXPLOSION. RICK OWENS IS THE AKIRA WHO DESTROYED THE LONELY FASHION APOCALYPSE AND OPENED A NEW WORLD OF UNIQUE AESTHETICS. DURING THE SPRING/SUMMER 2013 MEN&#39;S SHOW, HE LET THE METAL BAND WINNY PUHH HANG FROM THE CEILING TO PLAY; DURING THE SPRING/SUMMER 2014 WOMEN’S SHOW, HE INVITED AN AFRICAN AMERICAN STEP DANCE GROUP (A COMBINATION OF TAP DANCING, CHEERLEADING, AND MILITARY TRAINING) TO THE RUNWAY TO PERFORM AN INTERPRETATION OF WOMEN&#39;S INTIMIDATING STRENGTH AND POWER DANCES. MY FAVORITE AND MOST UNEXPECTED SHOW WAS THE SPRING/SUMMER 2016 SHOW, WHEN TWO FEMALE ATHLETES WERE CARRIED IN POSITIONS INSPIRED BY THE AVANT-GARDE PERFORMANCE ARTIST LEIGH BOWERY AND HIS WIFE, NICOLA BATEMAN. THIS IS A SHOW, A PAGE OF HISTORY, A SHOCKING SPECTACLE. TODAY, RICK OWENS CASTS HIS SPELL AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN PARIS EVERY SEASON. IN RECENT YEARS, HE HAS REFLECTED ON THE TURMOIL OF THE PANDEMIC, WAR, WOMEN&#39;S RIGHTS, AND POLITICAL SITUATION; RICK OWENS HAS USED FASHION TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO EXPRESS HIS URGENCY AND HELPLESSNESS TOWARDS THE REAL WORLD, TRYING TO FIND INNER PEACE. THE INSPIRATION FOR THE FALL/WINTER 2023 WOMEN&#39;S SHOW ORIGINATED FROM THE UKRAINIAN-RUSSIAN WAR. THE MODELS WERE TIED IN DONUT-LIKE DOWN CYLINDERS AND COVERED BY HUGE, OVERSIZED COATS. RICK EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS A KIND OF SOLEMN ELEGANCE, AND I THINK IT IS MORE OF A RESISTANCE AND PROTECTION, BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CORNER OF THE WORLD IS IN DANGER AND LIVE IN FEAR. BRITISH VOGUE CRITIC ANDERS CHRISTIAN MADSEN ONCE COMMENTED: &quot;IN TODAY&#39;S POST-MODERN FASHION WORLD, WEIRDNESS IS INCREASINGLY WITHERING, AND RICK OWENS HAS BECOME THE SAVIOR.&quot; TEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: FASHIONABLE SOLITARY YOU USED TO BE SHY, BUT NOW YOU’VE FULFILLED SUCH AN ECCENTRIC AND COOL LIFE. COULD YOU TELL US WHEN YOU’RE NOT AFRAID OF WHAT OTHERS THINK OF YOU ANYMORE? WEARING RICK OWENS FULFILLS THE BRAVERY FOR ME TO BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS. WHAT ABOUT YOU, WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG ANY ICON WHO INSPIRED YOU LIKE THIS? &quot;I ALWAYS REMEMBER SEEING DAVID BOWIE’S DIAMOND DOGS ALBUM COVER IN A RECORD STORE IN THE LITTLE CONSERVATIVE TOWN I WAS RAISED IN WHEN I WAS AROUND 13 YEARS OLD - IT VALIDATED THE WEIRDNESS AND ALIENATION I FELT AND MADE ME KNOW THERE WAS A PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR ME. I AM NO COMPARISON TO BOWIE, BUT I HOPE I HAVE HELPED OTHERS IN A SIMILAR WAY.&quot; AS A DESIGNER AND A BRAND LEADER, HOW DO YOU LEAD THE ENTIRE TEAM, AND HOW DO YOU LISTEN TO THE IDEAS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION? &quot;I DON’T THINK I AM SUCH A GREAT LISTENER- I DON’T HAVE A DESIGN ROOM OF PEOPLE SUGGESTING THINGS, I PRETTY MUCH KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WANT AND AM JUST LOOKING FOR THE BEST WAY TO GET MY IDEAS EXECUTED. I NEED EFFICIENT TECHNICIANS MORE THAN I NEED IDEAS…THAT BEING SAID, I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO END UP WITH A GROUP OF WILDLY CREATIVE COLLEAGUES THAT INSPIRE ME EVERY DAY AND FILL MY LIFE WITH SUCH GRATITUDE AND QUIET, GENTLE JOY. &quot; WHAT QUALITIES DOES A PERSON POSSESS THAT WOULD ATTRACT YOU TO HAVE THEM JOIN THE RICK OWENS TEAM? COULD YOU INTRODUCE US TO A CURRENT WORK PARTNER OF YOURS WHOM YOU TRUST AND ADMIRE THE MOST? IS THAT TYRONE DYLAN? &quot;I LOVE HAVING PEOPLE AROUND ME THAT HAVE THE PATIENCE TO SEE THINGS THROUGH IN A CAREFUL AND PRECISE WAY, ALLOWING ME TO BE RECKLESS AND IMPRACTICAL. BUT I DO NEED WINDOWS INTO OTHER WORLDS THAT I DON’T NECESSARILY WANT TO COMPLETELY IMMERSE MYSELF IN…….I LOVE HAVING EXPLORERS THAT COME BACK WITH THEIR EXOTIC REPORTS……..” THOM BROWNE&#39;S TEAM IS RENOWNED FOR WEARING THEIR SUIT UNIFORMS, AND HE MENTIONS, &quot;TO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS KNOW WHY THEY ARE WORKING.&quot; ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RICK OWENS TEAM ALWAYS NATURALLY DRESSES LIKE A FAMILY. DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET AND UNDISCLOSED RULES OR COMMONALITIES WITHIN YOUR TEAM? “NO RULES AND NO LIMITS. I ALWAYS WANTED TO SPREAD A MESSAGE OF INCLUSION AND EMBRACING OTHERNESS. THE IRONY IS THAT OUR OTHERNESS CAN SEEM FORBIDDING TO SOME AND MAKE THEM FEEL UNWELCOME….I NEED TO WORK ON ENSURING THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN…..” DO YOU THINK YOU’RE WORTH BEING THE ICON WHOM YOUNG PEOPLE FOLLOW? “I THINK I HAVE POSITIVE VALUES THAT I ENDORSE IN A SOFT WAY. I COULD BE A LOT WORSE.” WHICH BRAND OR DESIGNER IN FASHION WOULD UPSET YOU IF THEY LEFT THE INDUSTRY? “REI KAWAKUBO BALANCES OUT AN INDUSTRY THAT CAN BE VERY CONSERVATIVE….WE NEED A VOICE LIKE HERS TO REMIND US WHAT&#39;S POSSIBLE…..” WHO WOULD BE YOUR IDEAL PARTNER IF YOU COULD FIND A DESIGNER PARTNER TO WORK WITH, JUST LIKE MIUCCIA PRADA AND RAF SIMONS? WHICH FASHION HOUSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK IN? “I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO BE PART OF A TEAM AND NEGOTIATE- I WOULD JUST AUTOMATICALLY BECOME POLITE AND CONCEDE TO ANYTHING RATHER THAN CONTEST IT. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, I AM A LONER AND HAVE LEARNED TO ACCEPT THAT INSTEAD OF FORCING MYSELF TO BE SOMETHING I AM NOT.” IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ABOUT PARIS FASHION WEEK, DANIEL ROSEBERRY ONCE SAID, “FASHION SHOWS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE STUFF, BUT THE TOUCHES OF HEART ARE GETTING LESS AND LESS.” DO YOU AGREE WITH IT? WHAT’S YOUR AUTHENTIC THOUGHT ABOUT NOWADAYS FASHION SHOWS? “I THINK EVERY FASHION SHOW IS VALID IN THEIR OWN WAY…….SOMETIMES THE CYNICAL CALCULATIONS OF FASHION ARE JUST AS THRILLING AS THE MOST AUTHENTIC CREATIVE GESTURES……I FIND A WAY TO ENJOY EVERYTHING, PERVERSE OR GENUINE.” I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE VISITING MICHAEL HEIZER&#39;S LAND ART PIECES. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY RECENT ARTWORKS/ARTISTS THAT HAVE DEEPLY INSPIRED YOU? “I JUST SAW A DONALD JUDD SHOW THAT MADE ME FALL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN- I AM AFRAID I ONLY LIKE DEAD ARTISTS THAT HAVE MAINTAINED A CONSISTENT LEVEL UNTIL THE END- I CAN’T INVEST EMOTIONALLY IN SOMEONE WHOSE QUALITY OF OUTPUT ISN’T GUARANTEED.” WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INSPIRATION OR EMOTIONAL IMPACT FROM YOUR CREATIVE INSPIRATIONS, DO YOU PREFER TO SHARE IT WITH OTHERS IMMEDIATELY OR PROCESS IT ON YOUR OWN? WHAT IS YOUR USUAL METHOD FOR RECORDING OR DOCUMENTING THESE EMOTIONS AND INSPIRATIONS? “I DON’T FALL IN LOVE VERY EASILY- I HAVE FEW COMMITMENTS BUT THEY ARE DEEP AND LONG. AND WHILE MY LIFE IS AN OPEN BOOK, I KEEP A LOT TO MYSELF.” MONCLER + RICK OWENS UNIQUE COLLABORATION RICK OWENS, WHO HAS BEEN VERY RESISTANT TO WORK ON COLLABORATIONS IN THE PAST, HAS BECOME A LOYAL PARTNER OF TOP ITALIAN BRAND MONCLER. THIS SEASON, HE AND MONCLER ONCE AGAIN JOINED HANDS TO CREATE A CAPSULE SERIES. THEY ALSO DESIGNED A SLEEP POD MADE TO ISOLATE ONESELF FROM THE WORLD. IT IS EQUIPPED WITH A BED, OXYGEN REGENERATION DEVICE, AND TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED VENTILATION SYSTEM. HE EXPLAINED: &quot;I WANTED TO CREATE A SOUNDPROOF RETREAT FOR MYSELF. KIND OF LIKE CHRIST’S STONE TOMB OR SLEEPING BEAUTY’S GLASS COFFIN. I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT FOR MYSELF ANYWAY, BUT WHEN MONCLER SUGGESTED A COLLAB, I THOUGHT I WOULD BUILD A COLLECTION AROUND IT.” WHETHER YOU ARE IN A SLEEP POD OR WRAPPED IN ONE OF THE DOWN JACKETS, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN RICK’S VISION—AN ISOLATED AND WARM PLACE. HIS OBSESSION WITH BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE, MODERNIST SCULPTURES, AND FURNITURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONGLY REFLECTED IN HIS CLOTHING. &quot;I HOPE TO BE A SCULPTOR LIKE CONSTANTIN BRÂNCUȘI IN MY NEXT LIFE. BRÂNCUȘI INSPIRES ALL MY CREATIONS.&quot; A MAJOR FEATURE OF THE SERIES IS THE RADIANCE JACKETS MADE IN LIGHT BLACK, EARTHY BROWN, AND GRADIENT NEUTRAL TONES, INJECTED WITH RICK OWENS&#39; UNIQUE STYLE INTO THE MONOTONOUS WINTER DOWN JACKET—A SENSE OF DOOMSDAY TECHNOLOGY. ITEMS INCLUDE BOMBER JACKETS, DOWN JACKETS, LONG DUVET COATS, ELONGATED COATS, SKIRTS, SHORTS, AND TOPS. LONG KNITWEAR OR BRUSHED COTTON TOPS COME WITH SHOULDER BUTTONS AND OPENINGS FOR CUSTOM STYLING—LONG TUNICS, DRESSES, AND SKIRTS IN DENIM. A PULLOVER SCARF, PLUSH BOOTS, AND A RADIANCE-QUILTED BLANKET COMPLETE THE LOOK. TALKING ABOUT HIS CREATIONS IN RECENT SEASONS, INCLUDING THIS MONCLER COLLABORATION, WHICH HAS GRADUALLY BURST OUT FROM ALL BLACK TO MORE COLORS, RICK ONCE AGAIN REITERATED HIS LOVE FOR THE COLOR BLACK: &quot;BLACK CAN HIDE INSECURITIES FOR SOME OF US, I APPRECIATE WEARING BLACK FOR OBSERVING A LITTLE FORMALITY AND QUIET MODESTY- THE WORLD IS A VERY COLORFUL AND CLUTTERED SPACE, WEARING BLACK AND PROVIDING RESPITE FOR THE EYE CAN BE A POLITE GESTURE.” IN 2017, RICK OWENS RECEIVED THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD AT THE CFDA AWARDS CEREMONY, AND HE SAID: &quot;AS A HUMAN BEING, THE MOST BASIC NEED IS TO BE HEARD. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL HEARD.&quot; I THOUGHT THIS WAS WHAT COUNTLESS PEOPLE WANTED TO SAY TO HIM SINCE COUNTLESS BROKEN SOULS WHO WERE MARGINALIZED IN THE PAST HAD THE COURAGE TO DREAM.

WE MET ONCE IN 2016, ONCE IN 2019, AND NOW IN 2023. I AM GRATEFUL WE’VE MET THROUGH W EVERY TIME YOU’VE VISITED SEOUL. I’D FEEL SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DIDN’T CONTACT US WHEN YOU CAME TO SEOUL NOW! OH, I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME. IS IT THE THIRD? YES, I BROUGHT YOU PROOF! IN 2016, WE WENT TO DAPSIMNI ANTIQUE ART MALL, AND IN 2019, YOU HAD A BOOK SIGNING EVENT AT THE DOSAN PARK FLAGSHIP STORE. YOU HAD A 3D-PRINTED MASK THAT RESEMBLED YOUR FACE THEN. AH, I REMEMBER. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME. IT&#39;S BEEN 4 YEARS SINCE YOU CAME TO SEOUL; I&#39;M CURIOUS IF THERE&#39;S A SPECIAL REASON WHY YOU WANTED TO MEET AT THE THADDEUS ROPAC GALLERY. THADDEUS ROPAC IS A CLOSE FRIEND WHO LIVES IN PARIS, BUT I’VE KNOWN HIM SINCE HE WAS LIVING IN AUSTRIA. BUT THE REASON I CAME HERE TODAY IS NOT BECAUSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP BUT BECAUSE OF THE DONALD JUDD EXHIBITION. HE IS AN ARTIST I REALLY LIKE. THE EXHIBITIONS OF DONALD JUDD AND JOSEPH BEUYS ARE BEING HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY. DID YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OF THE ARTISTS WHEN YOU ARRANGED YOUR VISIT? WHEN IT COMES TO ART, JOSEPH BEUYS IS MY FIRST HERO. WHEN I ENTERED ART SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES AROUND 1989 OR 1990, I WAS UTTERLY FASCINATED BY HIS ART, WHICH WAS FULL OF UNIQUE ROMANCE, DRAMA, HUMANITY, EMPATHY, MYTH, AND MYSTERY. JOSEPH BEUYS WAS THE FIRST ARTIST TO INFLUENCE ME, AND TO THIS DAY, I STILL CONSIDER HIM THE STANDARD THAT DEFINES AN ARTIST. I FEEL VERY LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO COME TO KOREA AND SEE THE DONALD JUDD AND JOSEPH BEUYS EXHIBITIONS AT THE SAME TIME. JOSEPH BEUYS ONCE SAID THAT THE ACT OF CONSTANTLY DRAWING IS &#39;LIKE BREATHING,&#39; AND IS THERE AN &#39;ACT&#39; THAT IS AS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU AS BREATHING? PERHAPS HAVING A CLEAR SENSE OF PURPOSE, MEETING DEADLINES, AND MAINTAINING THE RHYTHM OF LIFE. I CAN&#39;T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT I WOULD BE LIKE WITHOUT THESE THINGS IN MY LIFE. I DON&#39;T REALLY LIKE WANDERING AROUND AIMLESSLY OR BEING SPONTANEOUS. I PREFER HAVING A CLEAR STARTING AND ENDING POINT. SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY ENJOY THE PROCESS OF WORKING, BUT I THINK DIFFERENTLY. THE DESTINATION IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE PROCESS. WHICH OF DONALD JUDD&#39;S WORKS CAUGHT YOUR EYE? I REALLY LIKE DONALD JUDD&#39;S STACKS, WHICH ARE VISIBLE FROM OUTSIDE THE GALLERY. HOWEVER, I AM NOT A COLLECTOR, NOR AM I A PERSON WHO HAS A NEED FOR POSSESSION, BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I REALLY WANT IN MY LIFE. THIS IS ONE OF THEM; I WOULD LOVE TO OWN AT LEAST ONE OF DONALD JUDD&#39;S STACKS. WHAT DOES OWNING A WORK OF ART MEAN TO YOU? IF THERE&#39;S ONE THING I DON&#39;T LIKE ABOUT ART, IT&#39;S THAT IT&#39;S A KIND OF TROPHY. EVEN IF YOU DON&#39;T WANT IT, A WORK OF ART INEVITABLY BECOMES A TROPHY. IT SHOWS THAT THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE ARTWORK IS IN A POSITION TO ENJOY A LIFE THAT PRIORITIZES PLEASURE. BUT IS IT JUST A TROPHY? OR IS IT SOME KIND OF TOTEM? A TOTEM MEANS SOMETHING THAT CONTAINS MAGICAL POWER THAT CAN AFFECT LIFE. SO, A WORK OF ART CAN BE A TROPHY, BUT I THINK IT ALSO HAS A MAGICAL POWER THAT GOES BEYOND THAT, SUCH AS THE POWER OF A TOTEM. OWNING DONALD JUDD&#39;S STACKS WOULD REMIND ME OF THE POWER GAINED FROM COMMITTING TO AESTHETIC REPETITION, CONTINUITY, IMMORTALITY, METHOD, AND ORDER. IT IS LIVING SURROUNDED BY SUCH POTENT MAGIC. NOW, LEAVING ASIDE THE TOPIC OF ARTWORK, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE UP TO. I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT YOU WOULD BE VISITING KOREA SHORTLY AFTER SHOWCASING THE WOMEN’S SPRING/SUMMER 2024 SHOW. I DON&#39;T THINK IT WAS PARTICULARLY BUSY. SHOULD I JUST SAY THAT I HAVE KEPT AT A CERTAIN PACE? AFTER FINISHING THE WOMEN&#39;S RUNWAY TWO WEEKS AGO, I HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH MY TEAM ABOUT THE FOLLOWING COLLECTION. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE NEXT FALL/WINTER COLLECTION. I WAS SPENDING MY TIME COMING UP WITH IDEAS FOR THE UPCOMING FALL COLLECTION AND PLANNING THE SHOW. WE’RE IN THE PROCESS OF DECIDING THE DETAILS: WHERE TO HOLD THE SHOW, HOW TO SET UP THE RUNWAY, WHAT BACKGROUND MUSIC TO USE, WHAT STYLE OF SHOES TO SHOWCASE, WHAT COLLABORATION TO DO, WHAT PROMOTION TO DO IN PARALLEL WITH THE COLLABORATION, ETC. THIS ALL TAKES PLACE IN MY HOME OFFICE IN PARIS. SO, EVERY DAY, I HAVE A FEW MEETINGS IN THE OFFICE, ANSWER EMAILS, AND GO OVER MY TO-DO LIST ON THE OUTDOOR TERRACE UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES. AFTERWARDS, I HAVE LUNCH AT ONE OF THE RESTAURANTS WITHIN A BLOCK OF MY HOUSE, AND ON THE WAY BACK, I STOP BY THE CHURCH OF SAINTE CLOTILDE BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME OF MY PARENTS. THIS IS A PLACE I HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF ALWAYS GOING TO WITH MY PARENTS WHEN THEY CAME TO PARIS. THIS YEAR IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT I HAVE BEEN ALONE SINCE BOTH OF MY PARENTS PASSED AWAY. SO, I GO TO THAT CHURCH TO HONOR MY PARENTS AND REMINISCE ABOUT MY TIME WITH THEM. I ALSO LIKE THIS CATHEDRAL BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE AN EXTENSION OF MY HOME. AS YOU MAY KNOW, OUR HOUSE HAS A STRONG CONCRETE FEEL, AND THE GRAY CONCRETE FLOOR, CEILING, AND BEAMS ARE ALL EXPOSED. THE CATHEDRAL SEEMS TO BE ANOTHER VERSION OF THAT. ALTHOUGH IT IS ACTUALLY MADE OF STONE RATHER THAN CONCRETE, THE CATHEDRAL HAS A HUGE VAULTED CEILING AND HAS TRACES OF ITS AGE, SIMILAR TO OUR HOUSE, SO IT FEELS LIKE ANOTHER ROOM IN MY HOUSE. I ALSO EXERCISE EVERY NIGHT SINCE I EAT A LOT OF ICE CREAM AND CHEESEBURGERS. I THINK MY ROLE IS TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE TO VERY STRICT, CONSERVATIVE, AND MORALISTIC VALUES SO THAT THE STANDARDS CAN BE BALANCED. THE WOMEN’S SS24 SHOW WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH THE SCATTERING OF FLOWER PETALS DURING THE FINALE. IT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE A GREAT CONNECTION TO YOUR BRAND, BUT I WAS CURIOUS IF THERE WAS A SPECIAL REASON BEHIND THE FINALE FEATURING PINK SMOKE AND FLOWER PETALS? I HAD A VERY VIOLENT AND BOMBASTIC SOUNDTRACK FOR MY MOST RECENT MEN&#39;S SHOW. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, MY TASTES ARE A BIT STRONG. SO, THE MEN&#39;S COLLECTION SHOW COULD HAVE LOOKED AGGRESSIVE OR TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY. HOWEVER, WHAT I AM TRYING TO EXPRESS IS NOT ANGER, BUT RATHER JOY. IT IS A KIND OF PASSIONATE JOY. WHENEVER I THINK OF MY SHOW, IT&#39;S THOSE SHOUTS OF JOY THAT COME TO MIND. I DON&#39;T THINK MY SHOWS ARE AGGRESSIVE OR DYSTOPIAN AT ALL. RATHER, IT CAN BE SAID TO BE A LOUD AND POWERFUL ROAR OF JOY. WHILE PREPARING FOR THE WOMEN&#39;S COLLECTION RUNWAY, EVERYONE EXPECTED A STAGE WITH A ROUGH ATMOSPHERE LIKE THE MEN&#39;S COLLECTION SHOW, SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL TO CREATE A VERY SOFT AND ROMANTIC CONTRAST. IT ALL STARTS WITH THE MUSIC. USUALLY, I SELECT SONGS THAT ARE ABOUT 3 MINUTES LONG AND THEN EDIT THE MUSIC TO FILL A 15-MINUTE SHOW. WHEN WORKING ON A COLLECTION, I ALSO EXPAND THE MUSIC BY FINDING THE PARTS I LIKE THE MOST AND EXAGGERATING OR HIGHLIGHTING THEM WHILE OMITTING SOME PARTS. ONCE THE MUSIC IS COMPLETE, IT HELPS TO FORM A PERFECT SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUNWAY AND THE COLLECTION ITSELF. THIS TIME, I CHOSE A SONG BY DIANA ROSS THAT WAS RELEASED IN HER LATEST ALBUM. WE HAD ASKED IF SHE COULD GIVE US RIGHTS TO AN UPBEAT, FUN POP SONG THAT WAS GREAT TO SING ALONG TO, AND FROM THERE, WE TURNED IT INTO A SLOW ANTHEM FOR THE SHOW. HER VOICE GIVES OFF A VERY FRAGILE FEELING BY ISOLATING THE VOCAL PART, LENGTHENING IT, AND STRENGTHENING THE CHORUS ELEMENTS, REMAKING IT INTO A HYMN OF HOPE. DIANA SINGING “I STILL BELIEVE IN LOVE” HAD A STRANGE WAY OF SHAKING PEOPLE’S HEARTS. SO, I THINK HER VOICE, THE PINK HAZE, THE ROSE PETALS, AND MY COLLECTION PAIRED TOGETHER TO CONVEY A ROMANTIC AND SOFT FEELING. LET’S MOVE ON TO TALKING ABOUT BOOKS. YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS BOOK FEATURES IMAGES FROM THE TIMES WHEN YOU EXPERIMENTED WITH COLORS AND MATERIALS YOU’D NEVER USED BEFORE. I WASN&#39;T REALLY THINKING ABOUT PUBLISHING ANOTHER BOOK, BUT RIZZOLI HAD REACHED OUT. IT HAD ALREADY BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE MY LAST BOOK WAS RELEASED, AND DANIELLE LEVITT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TAKING PICTURES OF MY RUNWAY COLLECTIONS. I THOUGHT WE HAD ACCUMULATED ENOUGH. THE FIRST BOOK COVERED 5 YEARS OF MY WORK, AND NOW THAT 5 YEARS HAVE PASSED, I FIGURED IT WAS TIME FOR ANOTHER BOOK. MY MAIN GOAL HAS BEEN TO PUT TOGETHER IMAGES FOR AN ARCHIVAL RECORD. I WANT TO LEAVE A CONTINUOUS RECORD THAT FORMS A COHERENT COLLECTION, SIMILAR TO DONALD JUDD&#39;S STACKS. THE IMAGES OF MY DESIGNS FOLLOW A FAMILIAR AND STANDARDIZED FORMAT WITHIN THE BOOK. SO, THE CLOTHES CAN REALLY STAND OUT UNDER VERY CLEAN LIGHTING; MY AESTHETIC EXPRESSION IS CLEARLY EXPRESSED. I LIKE THAT IT DOCUMENTS MY DESIGNS VERY HONESTLY AND CONSISTENTLY. FEW PEOPLE WORK TO CREATE RECORDS THAT SHOWCASE THEIR WORK LIKE THIS AND IN THIS STRUCTURED FORMAT. TIME WAS ALSO CAPTURED IN A VERY UNIQUE WAY. WOULD IT BE SAID THAT THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR EACH WORK BECOMES MEANINGLESS, AND THE COLLECTION BECOMES ONE LARGE WORK OF ART? ALTHOUGH I SAID IT WAS ‘ART,’ I DON’T KNOW IF PEOPLE CONSIDER MY DESIGNS ART. RATHER, IT SEEMS SAFE TO SAY THAT DANIELLE’S RECORDED WORK OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS IS A WORK OF ART. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO REFLECT ON MY WORK 10 OR 20 YEARS FROM NOW AND DRAW A NARRATIVE OF MY CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, AT THIS MOMENT, IT ISN&#39;T EASY TO SEE THE LARGER FLOW BECAUSE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO THE ONGOING TIME. ALL I CAN SEE RIGHT NOW IS THAT I&#39;M MOVING FORWARD AND WHAT I NEED TO DO NEXT. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO CONCENTRATE BEYOND THAT. THERE WILL COME A DAY IN THE DISTANT FUTURE WHEN I WILL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE ALL THE PHOTOS IN THIS BOOK AND UNDERSTAND THEIR MEANING. BUT RIGHT NOW, I HAVE NO IDEA. WHAT DOES MEETING FANS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD MEAN TO YOU? IT&#39;S NOT AN EASY TASK, IS IT? WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THIS? TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD AND MEETING PEOPLE IS SO MUCH FUN! FOR THIS TRIP, I’M HOLDING BOOK SIGNING EVENTS IN KOREA AND JAPAN, AND I MAY DO ONE MORE WHEN I RETURN TO PARIS. HOLDING EVENTS LIKE THESE MEANS A LOT; I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THOSE WHO HAVE SHOWN INTEREST IN AND SUPPORTED MY WORK. IT&#39;S FUN TO MEET EACH OTHER, AND THE FEELING OF HEARING THE WARM HEARTS OF THOSE WHO VISIT IS INDESCRIBABLE. I FEEL LIKE IT&#39;S MY DUTY TO SAVOR AND APPRECIATE THESE MOMENTS. WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO IN THIS BOOK? WHEN DESIGNING, I AIM TO OFFER ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS TO THE STANDARD. BEAUTY STANDARDS THAT ARE CULTURALLY ACCEPTED CAN BE TOO STRICT OR EVEN CRUEL AT TIMES, AND MANY PEOPLE FEEL EXCLUDED FROM MAINSTREAM BEAUTY STANDARDS. FOR INSTANCE, AIRPORT BEAUTY SECTIONS TEND TO CATER ONLY TO A PARTICULAR PRIVILEGED GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOSE VALUES AND ASPIRATIONS ARE PREDETERMINED BY THEIR SOCIAL STATUS AND UNREALISTIC STANDARDS OF BEAUTY. I WANTED TO PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD RESONATE WITH A WIDER AUDIENCE. I DON&#39;T INTEND TO CRITICIZE BEAUTY, BUT I BELIEVE THAT BEAUTY STANDARDS CAN BE SOMEWHAT RIGID. THEREFORE, I SEE IT AS MY MISSION TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVES TO STRICT, CONSERVATIVE, AND MORALISTIC VALUES AND CREATE A MORE BALANCED STANDARD OF BEAUTY. THIS IS A PERSONAL QUESTION, BUT WHETHER YOU MEANT IT OR NOT, MANY PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE A COOL &#39;ADULT.&#39; SO, I WANT TO ASK. WHAT DO YOU THINK A COOL ADULT IS? I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A COOL ADULT IS MICHÈLE. I DON&#39;T THINK I THINK OF MYSELF AS AN ADULT. OCCASIONALLY, I TAKE THE SUBWAY AND LOOK AT OTHERS AROUND ME. SOMETIMES, I NOTICE A MAN IN A SUIT JACKET, BUTTONED-UP SHIRT, AND LOAFERS WHO LOOKS LIKE AN OLD PROFESSOR. HE HAS GRAY HAIR, A BALD FOREHEAD, AND A BUSHY BEARD. I WONDER IF HE&#39;S MY AGE IF HE WAS BORN IN THE 60S, AND IF HE EXPERIENCED THE ERA OF RADICAL FREEDOM IN THE 70S. HOWEVER, HE APPEARS TO BE A VERY CONSERVATIVE OLD GENTLEMAN, DESPITE BEING SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE TAKEN DRUGS AND GONE TO &#39;FEAR&#39; CONCERTS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS. IT&#39;S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT HE HAD SUCH EXPERIENCES WHEN HE LOOKS ORDINARY AT HIS AGE. IN CONTRAST, I OPENLY SHARE MY EXPERIENCES AND INTERESTS. I THINK THE KIND OF ADULT WHO PERCEIVES ME AS &quot;COOL&quot; IS THE ONE WHO VALUES THESE QUALITIES. WHETHER IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST INTERVIEWED YOU OR NOW, I AM ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT MOMENTS LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN IDOL IN MY HEART, DO YOU STILL HAVE MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU FEEL NERVOUS OR AFRAID? ONE SITUATION IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR ME TO HANDLE - WHEN I FEEL THAT THE PERSON I LOVE DOESN&#39;T SHOW ME RESPECT OR CARE FOR ME. OTHER THAN THAT, I MUST ADMIT THAT I CAN BE A BIT SELFISH AT TIMES. I SOMETIMES FEEL FRUSTRATED WHEN I DON&#39;T GET WHAT I WANT OR WHEN PEOPLE DON&#39;T RESPOND AS QUICKLY OR THOROUGHLY AS I&#39;D LIKE THEM TO. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT I GET EXTREMELY UPSET. IT&#39;S JUST THAT I TAKE MY JOB RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY AND EXPECT OTHERS TO DO THEIR PART AS WELL. WHEN THERE IS NO PROGRESS, IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING. BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE IS AS MOTIVATED OR DRIVEN AS I AM. IN CONCLUSION, I AM NOT EASILY ANXIOUS OR NERVOUS, BUT I DO HAVE MY MOMENTS OF FRUSTRATION. AWESOME, I’D LOVE TO LIVE WITHOUT THAT FEAR. THIS IS MY LAST QUESTION. NEXT TIME YOU COME TO SEOUL AGAIN, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO? W WILL BE WELL PREPARED. OF COURSE, I WILL VISIT KOREA AGAIN. I DON&#39;T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PLANS YET, BUT I AM SURE I WILL VISIT AGAIN. I HAVE ALWAYS REGRETTED NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE MORE TEMPLES AND PALACES IN KOREA. I AM VERY INTERESTED IN OLD SEOUL. IT’S DISAPPOINTING SINCE I’VE ONLY HAD THE CHANCE TO SEE THE MODERN SIDE OF SEOUL. NEXT TIME I COME, I HOPE WE CAN MEET IN A PLACE THAT STILL RETAINS THE OLD DAYS OF SEOUL.

MONCLER’S COLLABORATIONS ARE SPECIAL. THIS IS CLEARLY SEEN WHEN LOOKING AT MONCLER GENIUS, WHICH HAS DEVELOPED INTO A CREATIVE COLLABORATION WITH A FOCUS ON INNOVATION. LAST FEBRUARY, THEY HOSTED THE ART OF GENIUS, PRESENTING AN INCREDIBLE VISION OF TRANSFORMING THEIR COLLABORATION INTO A NEW CO-CREATION PLATFORM. BEYOND FASHION, IT IS ABOUT EXPLORING THE BOUNDARIES OF CREATION AND FINDING NEW PARADIGMS AT THE INTERSECTION OF ART, DESIGN, ENTERTAINMENT, MUSIC, SPORTS, AND CULTURE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, MONCLER AND RICK OWENS MET. AT THE ART OF GENIUS EVENT RICK OWENS ATTRACTED THE WORLD&#39;S ATTENTION BY SHOWCASING A SLEEPING CAPSULE. WE SPOKE WITH RICK OWENS ABOUT HIS COLLABORATIVE COLLECTION, COMPLETE WITH CLOTHING WORTHY OF A SLEEPING CAPSULE. WHAT DOES MONCLER MEAN TO YOU? I THINK OF MONCLER AS A PATRON OF THE ARTS- ENGAGING IN OUR AESTHETIC CULTURE AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. CAN YOU SHARE THE PROCESS BEHIND THE COLLABORATION WITH MONCLER? I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED SCULPTING WITH DUVET AND MONCLER WELCOMES EXPERIMENTATION AND EXPLORATION- THERE WERE NO CHALLENGES, ONLY ENTHUSIASM AND ENCOURAGEMENT. HOW WOULD YOU BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE THEME OF THIS COLLECTION? I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WHAT MONCLER STANDS FOR WERE WARMTH, PROTECTION, AND DRIVE, AND THROUGH THIS COLLABORATION, I COMBINED MY OWN AESTHETIC WITH THE CONCEPT OF TRAVEL WITHIN PROTECTION. FROM SOCKS TO A STEEL SLEEPING CAPSULE. IT IS A FULLY RESOLVED AND ATTAINABLE STORY. ONE OF THE THINGS I’VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT RICK OWEN’S STYLE IS WHY YOU TEND TO KEEP THE OVERALL SILHOUETTES EXTREMELY LEAN AND LONG. I’M WONDERING WHAT THE INTENTION BEHIND THE LONG SLEEVES AND ELONGATED SILHOUETTES IS? THERE IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE TO ADDING TRAILING EXCESSIVE LENGTHS OF UNNECESSARY FABRIC TO GARMENTS. A SENSE OF PAGEANTRY LIKE A TRAIN OR THINKING BEYOND NORMAL BOUNDARIES. YOU PRODUCED A SLEEPING CAPSULE FOR MONCLER’S ‘ART OF GENIUS’ EVENT. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE CAPSULE? WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE BUS, IT WAS FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE- MY PARENTS WERE OLDER AND NOT ABLE TO TRAVEL TO EUROPE ANYMORE AND THEREFORE MY LIFE WOULD CHANGE TO ACCOMMODATE GOING TO THEM. I HADN’T BEEN TO CALIFORNIA IN 20 YEARS AND WANTED TO MAKE IT A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE. LATER, I WAS CONSIDERING GETTING AN APARTMENT IN NY BUT WANTED TO ENSURE AN ESCAPE FROM THE CONSTANT ENERGY AND BUZZ OF CONSTRUCTION, SO I CAME UP WITH A ROOMY SOUND PROOFED SEALED CAPSULE THAT EVOKED SLEEPING BEAUTIES GLASS COFFIN OR MICHAEL JACKSON’S HYPERBARIC CHAMBER. COULD YOU SELECT ITEMS FROM THIS COLLECTION THAT HAVE EFFECTIVELY WORKED AS INTENDED? THE DUVET JUMPSUIT ZIPS ALL THE WAY OVER THE HEAD BUT CAN BE PEELED DOWN AS PANTS WITH OPULENT VOLUMES AROUND THE HIPS. WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL FAVORITE PIECE FROM THE COLLECTION? I LOVE THE RADIANCE QUILTED LONG COAT FOR MORNING COFFEE WINTER WALKS IN THE GARDEN. PEOPLE SOMETIMES DESCRIBE THINGS AS “RICK OWENS-ESQUE.” HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU HEAR SUCH COMMENTS? DELIGHTED. EVEN IF IT&#39;S DEPRECATING, I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARD AND THAT’S A NICE THING. IS THERE ANY LAST THING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY? EMPATHIZE WITH AN OPEN MIND!

I WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO SURVIVE EVERY DAY,” RICK OWENS SAYS WITH A SMILE. HE CAME TO JAPAN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS TO CELEBRATE THE LAUNCH OF HIS BOOK “MORE RICK OWENS,” WHICH HAS IMAGES SHOWCASING HIS COLLECTION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, STARTING WITH THE FALL/WINTER 2019 COLLECTION. THIS PROJECT BEGAN WHEN HE MET PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVITT, AND HE EXPLAINED TO US THAT ALL IMAGES WERE TAKEN BACKSTAGE DURING THE RUNWAY SHOWS. DANIELLE IS KNOWN FOR PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE FROM MANY SUBCULTURES, AND HE EMPATHIZES WITH HER. AFTER ALL, THE FASHION WORLD HAS VERY LIMITED IDEAS OF BEAUTY STANDARDS THAT ARE COMMONLY ACCEPTED. HE WAS A BOY LIVING IN A CONSERVATIVE TOWN AND PART OF THE GENERATION WHO SUFFERED FROM A SENSE OF ALIENATION BUT STILL LIKED TO DRESS UP, EVEN IF PEOPLE AROUND HIM WOULD LOOK AT HIM AS AN ENEMY. THIS IS WHY HE WANTS TO CELEBRATE DIVERSITY AND OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO EVERYTHING CONSIDERED THE NORM. SINCE FOUNDING HIS BRAND IN 1994, HE HAS DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM MAINSTREAM FASHION AND CONTINUED PURSUING HIS UNIQUE EXPRESSION. IN PARIS IN SEPTEMBER, HE FOUND INSPIRATION IN DIANA ROSS&#39;S SONG “I STILL BELIEVE IN LOVE.” THE MESSAGE BEHIND THE CREATION OF THIS SONG IS ALSO BASED ON THE IDEA THAT “THE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY IS THE PURSUIT OF HOPE,” WHICH OWENS MENTIONED HE HAS BEEN INTENSELY AWARE OF SINCE THE WAR BEGAN IN UKRAINE. “WHEN WE BEGIN PLANNING A COLLECTION, WE FIRST CHOOSE THE SONG WE WANT TO USE AND THEN DESIGN OUR CLOTHES AROUND IT. THIS IS SO THERE IS A SYMBOLIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SONG AND THE CLOTHES. I NORMALLY REFINE A SONG BY SLOWING DOWN THE BACKGROUND TO MAKE IT RESONATE BETTER AND THEN CHOOSING SILHOUETTES AND MATERIALS THAT MAY FIT. IN OTHER WORDS, IT FEELS LIKE I&#39;M DRAWING A PATTERN WITH THE MUSIC.” RICK DESCRIBES THIS COLLECTION AS “SOFT, EMOTIONAL, AND SENTIMENTAL.” SWEET, WARM COLORS LIKE PINK AND ORANGE ARE MIXED INTO THE MONOTONE, EMPHASIZING LITHENESS AND SOFTNESS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. EVEN THOUGH “I STILL BELIEVE” IS A POP SONG, DIANA’S VOICE IS VULNERABLE, RAW, AND SINCERE. “I STILL BELIEVE IN LOVE. I’VE TRIED TO EXPRESS HOPE, AND I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A VERY POSITIVE STATEMENT.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

FOR HIS MANY ADMIRERS, HIS IS NOT A BRAND BUT A RELIGION. IN THIS INTERVIEW (AND IN A NEW BOOK), HE TALKS ABOUT HIS EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY THAT HAS LED HIM TO BECOME ONE OF THE LEADING NAMES IN THE SECTOR. BUT THAT ALSO BECAME A CHALLENGE TO LIFE: “REVENGE ON THOSE WHO BULLIED ME FOR BEING AN EFFEMINATE CHILD.&quot; FASHION NEEDS A CONTEXT TO STEP INTO AND A PRESENT TO DEAL WITH TO MAKE SENSE. THERE ARE VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE, AND RICK OWENS IS ONE OF THEM. THE CALIFORNIAN DESIGNER, WHO NOW LIVES BETWEEN PARIS AND VENICE — HE CALLS THE CHOICE “REVENGE ON THOSE WHO BULLIED ME FOR BEING AN EFFEMINATE CHILD” — AND HAS ALWAYS DONE THINGS HIS WAY. AND HE WAS RIGHT, TOO. HIS BRAND IS FIERCELY INDEPENDENT, HIS COMMERCIAL SUCCESS IS CONSTANTLY GROWING (THE ESTIMATE IS 200 MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES IN 2023), AND HIS CLOTHES ARE SO STRONG THAT THEY ARE ENOUGH ON THEIR OWN. THIS IS DEMONSTRATED BY MORE RICK OWENS (PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI NEW YORK), THE NEXT VOLUME THAT DOCUMENTS HIS COLLECTIONS FROM 2019 TO TODAY (THE LAST BOOK, RICK OWENS, COVERS HIS WORKS FROM 2014 TO 2019). THE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN BY DANIELLE LEVITT BACKSTAGE AT HIS FASHION SHOWS. THE BACKGROUND IS ALWAYS WHITE; THE MODELS ARE THE ONLY SUBJECTS, AND THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO THE HISTORICAL MOMENT OR WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THEM. “I LIKE THIS REPETITIVENESS, AS IT GIVES STRENGTH AND MEANING TO THE PROJECT. BESIDES, THE IMAGES WERE TAKEN AT THE BEST TIME, WHEN THE MODELS ARE ABOUT TO GO OUT ON THE RUNWAY: THE ENERGY AND SENSE OF ANTICIPATION ARE PALPABLE. AND IT&#39;S ALSO THE MOMENT WHEN I HAVE ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE CLOTHES. EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY THE WAY I WANT IT,” OWENS EXPLAINS, CHATTING AMIABLY FROM A REMOTE BEACH IN MEXICO WHERE HE IS ON VACATION. HOW DID YOU CHOOSE WHICH LOOK TO PUBLISH FROM THE COLLECTIONS? “I APPLY THE SAME METHOD TO EVERYTHING: WORK QUICKLY, LEAVE, RETURN, MAKE A FEW CHANGES, LEAVE AGAIN, COME BACK, AND MAKE OTHER CHANGES. FINALLY, I FINISH AND AVOID OVERTHINKING.” IN THIS PROCESS, HOW IMPORTANT IS THE OPINION OF OTHERS? “I USED TO THINK I NEEDED IT, BUT THEN I REALIZED IT WAS MORE OF A SUPERSTITION THAN ANYTHING ELSE, SO I GOT RID OF IT. THE THING IS, I&#39;VE NEVER PLAYED SPORTS OR LEARNED TEAMWORK, AND BEING AN ONLY CHILD DOESN&#39;T HELP EITHER. I WRITE THE RELEASES FOR MY COLLECTIONS ON MY OWN BECAUSE, IN A WORLD OF BRANDS WHERE DESIGNERS HAVE TO FOLLOW CERTAIN PARAMETERS AND PRIORITIES SET BY OTHERS, I VALUE SPEAKING IN MY VOICE. THAT&#39;S WHY MY SHOWS MEAN SO MUCH TO ME - THEY&#39;RE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE THE GARMENTS, THE SET, AND THE MUSIC THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY.” IT&#39;S NOT JUST YOU; THE TURNOUT OF FANS TRYING TO ATTEND YOUR FASHION SHOWS IS ALWAYS REMARKABLE. “HAVE YOU SEEN THE PARTY SCENE FROM THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW? WHEN I WAS 16, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE COOLEST PARTY EVER, AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO BE THERE. BUT NOW, LOOKING AT MY AUDIENCE, I REALIZE THAT IN THE END, I WAS ABLE TO ORGANIZE THAT PARTY MYSELF.&quot; AMONG THE FASHION SHOWS IN THE BOOK, THERE ARE ALSO THOSE SET UP DURING THE LOCKDOWN AT LIDO DI VENEZIA. “IT WAS SURREAL. THERE WERE VERY FEW OF US; THE BACKSTAGE WAS IN THE LOBBY OF A HOTEL THAT HAD REOPENED JUST FOR US, AND EVERYTHING WAS PRECARIOUS. BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOUR CHARACTER IS FORMED IN ADVERSITY: I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING POSITIVE IN SUCH A DARK TIME.” IN ADDITION TO THE RUNWAYS AND BOOKS, YOUR WORK ALSO ENDED UP IN A MUSEUM: IN 2017, THE MILAN TRIENNALE DEDICATED THE SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN EXHIBITION TO YOU. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO SAY THAT FASHION IS A LIVING THING AND THAT IT DOESN&#39;T BELONG IN MUSEUMS? “BUT OF COURSE, IT BELONGS IN MUSEUMS: IT IS THE RELIC OF A MOMENT FIXED IN TIME, AND LIKE ALL RELICS, IT MUST BE EXHIBITED IN A SHRINE.” SPEAKING OF MOMENTS FIXED IN TIME, YOU POSTED A VIDEO OF 2003 ON INSTAGRAM. WHAT DID YOU THINK UPON SEEING IT AGAIN? “THAT I WAS ARROGANT. AND THAT I HAD AN AMAZING PHYSIQUE. &quot;THE FACE, HOWEVER, I PREFER MY CURRENT ONE. TWENTY YEARS AGO, IT WAS SOFTER, AND I LOOKED LIKE A KID TRYING TO BE TOUGH. I LIKE MY SHARPER AND MORE AUSTERE FEATURES. LAST YEAR, I EVEN TRIED BOTOX AND SOME FILLERS, BUT THEY DIDN&#39;T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT. EVEN BETTER, I REALLY CARE ABOUT ALL OF MY FEATURES.” HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN FASHION? “STUDYING ART BECAUSE I WANTED TO BECOME JULIAN SCHNABEL. OR AT LEAST, JUST LIKE HIM. BUT I SOON REALIZED THAT TO BE AN ARTIST, YOU MUST BE INTELLECTUALLY RAMPANT AND RECKLESS, AND I WAS AFRAID I DIDN&#39;T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY. IN HINDSIGHT, I NOW KNOW I WOULD HAVE MANAGED IT, REGARDLESS OF THE SUCCESS. OH WELL, IT&#39;S GONE. MY FATHER, A PRAGMATIC FELLOW, THEN SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD AIM FOR SOMETHING USEFUL; I LISTENED TO HIM, AND I ENROLLED IN A MODEL-MAKING COURSE. I WAS INCLINED TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS REASONED IN THREE DIMENSIONS AND KNEW THAT GOOD MODELERS ARE ALWAYS SOUGHT AFTER. THIS IS HOW I MET MICHÈLE (LAMY, HIS WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER). AT THE TIME SHE LIVED IN LOS ANGELES, I WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF HER BRAND.” WHAT WAS THE FIRST PIECE YOU CREATED? “LET ME THINK... A NILE GREEN MONTANA JACKET WITH HUGE SHOULDERS. BUT IN THE EARLY DAYS, I COPIED A LOT OF PIECES BY GREAT DESIGNERS. A GREAT TRAINING GROUND.” AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE WHO COPY YOU? “ONCE, IN A VERY DISTANT AND NOT RICH COUNTRY, I FOUND MYSELF IN FRONT OF A WOMAN WEARING A VERY CHEAP IMITATION OF MY LEATHER JACKET. THINKING THAT, IN SUCH A PLACE, SOMEONE HAD CHOSEN TO COPY ME MADE ME PROUD. OF COURSE, IF I WERE AN UNKNOWN AND POOR DESIGNER, I WOULD BE ANGRY, BUT WHEN YOU PRESENT YOUR CREATION TO THE WORLD, SOMEONE ELSE WILL INEVITABLY MAKE IT THEIR OWN.” HOW MUCH DID GROWING UP IN A CATHOLIC FAMILY AFFECT YOUR VISION? “ACTUALLY, ONLY MY MOTHER WAS, AND AT HOME, WE WEREN&#39;T PARTICULARLY STRICT. THAT SAID, IT CERTAINLY SHAPED ME. IN THE SMALL TOWN WHERE I LIVED, THE NUNS IN THEIR DARK OUTFITS WERE THE HEIGHT OF CHIC; AT SCHOOL, WE STUDIED THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS, WHO DID GOOD AND RIGHTEOUS THINGS WEARING BEAUTIFUL LONG DRESSES, AND EVERY DAY, WE WOULD ENTER THE CHURCH TO WORSHIP A MAN ON A CROSS HALF NAKED AND WITH SCULPTED ABS. THAT&#39;S BASICALLY MY WHOLE IMAGINATION.” (HE LAUGHS) ARE YOU RELIGIOUS? “I BELIEVE IN POSITIVE ENERGY BEYOND LIFE. GOOD ALWAYS PREVAILS IN THE END, EVEN IF WITH DIFFICULTY: THE FUTURE OF CIVILIZATION IS BUILT THIS WAY, OVERCOMING TRAGEDIES AND WARS.” INSTEAD, HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR FUTURE? “I WOULD LIKE TO BE LIKE MR. ARMANI AND WORK UNTIL I AM 90 YEARS OLD. IN FACT, I&#39;D LIKE TO HAVE A STROKE WHILE I&#39;M WORKING, TO DIE DOING WHAT I LOVE THE MOST.” BUT YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER YOU. “IT USED TO WORRY ME A LOT, BUT THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT DIOR: THE BRAND IS DOING GREAT TODAY, BUT IF I WERE CHRISTIAN DIOR, WOULD I BE HAPPY WITH WHAT IT HAS BECOME? I DON&#39;T THINK SO. OR EVEN MARGIELA: A GREAT JOB HAS BEEN DONE TO PRESERVE THE BRAND&#39;S IDENTITY, BUT I&#39;M NOT SURE HOW MARTIN FEELS ABOUT THAT. BUT THAT&#39;S HOW IT WORKS: BRANDS GET BIGGER, THEY EVOLVE. AT THE MOMENT, I&#39;M CAUGHT UP BETWEEN MY EGO, WHICH WOULD LIKE RICK OWENS TO END UP WITH ME, TO BE REMEMBERED THE WAY I THOUGHT OF HIM, AND THE WILL TO MAKE SURE THAT MY GRANDCHILDREN CAN BENEFIT FROM ALL THIS. I HAVEN&#39;T DECIDED YET. ALSO, BECAUSE, IN REALITY, IN THE END, DOES IT MATTER TO ME? I&#39;LL BE DEAD ANYWAY.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

THE RICK OWENS SHOW IS FAMOUSLY KNOWN TO ATTRACT HIS ENTHUSIASTIC FANS. SO, I ANTICIPATED THAT RICK, WITH FOLLOWERS WHO SPORT UNCONVENTIONAL HAIRSTYLES AND MAKEUP WITH A SOMBER ATMOSPHERE, WOULD BE RATHER INTIMIDATING. HOWEVER, TO MY SURPRISE, HE APPEARED BEFORE US WITH A CALM EXPRESSION. WHILE LOOKING AT THE COVER OF OUR MAGAZINE&#39;S NOVEMBER 2023 ISSUE, WHICH WAS PHOTOGRAPHED AT THE ENOURA OBSERVATORY DESIGNED BY CONTEMPORARY ARTIST HIROSHI SUGIMOTO, RICK SAID, “I WENT HERE JUST YESTERDAY.” HE CONTINUED, “HIROSHI (HIROSHI SUGIMOTO) WAS IN CHARGE OF THE PRODUCTION, AND I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE COSTUMES FOR AN OPERA PERFORMED AT THE PARIS OPERA IN 2019. I HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH RYOJI (RYOJI IKEDA), WHO WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE MUSIC AND SPATIAL DIRECTION. I HUNG OUT WITH THEM IN ENOURA AND WENT TO THE HOT SPRINGS. IT WAS VERY QUIET AND PEACEFUL. BEFORE THAT, I WAS IN KYOTO AND STAYED AT AMAN KYOTO GARDEN. IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL, AND THE STONES USED THROUGHOUT THE SPACE WERE AMAZING. I VISITED A FEW TEMPLES BUT SPENT MOST OF MY TIME IN THE GARDENS. I’VE SINCE BEEN IN TOKYO AND NOTICED MORE SKYSCRAPERS THAN I THOUGHT.” “I RETURNED TO TOKYO FOR A BOOK SIGNING AND A RAVE PARTY I WAS HOSTING. THE IMAGES IN MY LATEST BOOK WERE TAKEN BY PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVITT BACKSTAGE DURING OUR RUNWAY SHOWS. I MET HER THROUGH A FRIEND WHO WAS MAKING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT US, AND HER LIFE’S WORK OF PHOTOGRAPHING MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WAS AMAZING, SO I DECIDED TO WORK WITH HER. I ASKED HER TO TAKE PHOTOS OF ME AND THE CLOTHES I MAKE, WHICH ARE A WAY OF EXPRESSING MYSELF IN SOCIETY.” DANIELLE, WHO RICK DESCRIBES AS A “SINCERE AND BRIGHT PERSONALITY,” SAID THAT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING SHE PHOTOGRAPHED THIS TIME WAS THE COLLECTION HE ANNOUNCED DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC FOR THE SPRING/SUMMER 2021 TO FALL/WINTER 2021-22 SEASONS. “THESE WERE VERY DIFFICULT TIMES FOR EVERYONE, SO I THOUGHT A COLLECTION CREATED IN THE FACE OF WORLDLY THREATS WOULD CONVEY AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE. THEREFORE, I HELD A SHOW WITHOUT AN AUDIENCE ON LIDO ISLAND IN VENICE, ITALY, WHERE I SPENT MY SUMMERS. WE GATHERED A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTED THE CLOTHES FROM THE FACTORY, ABOUT A TWO-HOUR DRIVE FROM LIDO. I THINK WE DID OUR BEST AND WERE ABLE TO PROCEED UNDER THE LIMITED CONDITIONS.” “UNLIKE BRANDS THAT HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE OPINIONS OF DESIGN TEAMS, MARKETING, AND SALES, OUR GREATEST STRENGTH IS THAT WE CAN EXPRESS OURSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS. SO, OVER THE PAST FEW SEASONS, I HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON PLACES CONNECTED TO ME, WHICH EXPLAINS THE TITLE OF MY RECENT COLLECTIONS. THE SPRING/SUMMER LIDO MEN&#39;S COLLECTIONS HIGHLIGHT A HIGH WAIST, NARROW WAIST, AND LONG LEGS SILHOUETTE. WE WANTED TO ACHIEVE POWERFUL LOOKS, SO WE UNIFIED IT IN BLACK. FOR MY NEXT COLLECTION, I AM THINKING OF NAMING IT “PORTERVILLE,&#39;&#39; AFTER THE TOWN IN CALIFORNIA WHERE I GREW UP,&#39;&#39; SAYS OWENS. HE IS NOT JUST A FASHION DESIGNER, BUT ALSO DESIGNS FURNITURE AND JEWELRY ALONGSIDE HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY. THEY BOTH SHARE THE SAME CREATIVE PHILOSOPHY. RICK SHARED THAT HE IS GREATLY INFLUENCED BY MOVIES, PARTICULARLY HORROR FILMS SUCH AS &quot;THE BLACK CAT&quot; (1934), WHERE BELA LUGOSI AND BORIS KARLOFF STARRED. HE ALSO ADMIRES WORKS LIKE &quot;THE TEN SONGS&quot; (1923), &quot;KING OF KINGS&quot; (1927), &quot;NERO THE TYRANT&quot; (1932), AND &quot;CLEOPATRA&quot; (1934). BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE AND ARTISTS SUCH AS DONALD JUDD, CONSTANTIN BRANCUSI, AUGUSTE RODIN, AND GUSTAVE MOREAU ALSO INSPIRE HIM. WHILE HE DOESN&#39;T CONSIDER HIMSELF AN EXPERT OR A COLLECTOR, HE IS INTERESTED IN CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS LIKE ANNE IMHOFF, ANSELM KIEFER, AND THOMAS HOUSEAGO. FOR OVER 25 YEARS, RICK OWENS HAS BEEN CULTIVATING A DISTINCT PERSPECTIVE. DESPITE BEING A RESERVED INDIVIDUAL, HIS UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO INDEPENDENCE HAS ALLOWED HIM TO PURSUE HIS VISION. HIS DESIGNS, WHICH GENUINELY EMBODY HIS SPIRIT, ARE SURE TO CONTINUE TO APPEAL TO THOSE WHO FEEL ALIENATED BY SOCIETAL NORMS.

ACROSS SOME OF THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE WEB, CLAIMS OF SATANISM WERE BLASTED WITH WILD ABANDON, WHILE GOSSIPY, RED-TOP TABLOID RAGS, AS THEY SO OFTEN DO, ALSO GOT IN ON THE ACT. FOR A GOOD FEW DAYS, HEADLINES WHIPPED UP A WAVE OF HYSTERIA, WHEN IN ACTUAL FACT, OWENS WAS JUST HAVING A BIT OF FUN. “DO PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVE IN SATAN?” HE ASKS ME WITH A WRY SMILE AS WE SPEAK OVER ZOOM. “I MEAN, IS THAT A JOKE?” IN OWENS’ DESIGNS, BOTH ON THE RUNWAY AND WITHIN HIS EARLIER DMS COLLAB, THE PENTAGRAM IS USED AS WHAT HE CALLS “A GENTLE HECKLE” TO THE BIGOTS OF THE WORLD, AND A WAY OF BALANCING THINGS OUT. “INTOLERANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE, AND IT’S NEVER GOING AWAY,” HE SAYS. “WHEN I USE PENTAGRAMS, IT’S ABOUT OTHERNESS. IT’S ABOUT CELEBRATING THE FREAK IN ALL OF US, OR THE YOUNG FREAKS OUT THERE WHO NEED SUPPORT AND WHO NEED ENCOURAGEMENT AND WHO NEED RECOGNITION.” DR MARTENS MIGHT SIMILARLY BE A BRAND ROOTED IN SUBCULTURE, KITTING OUT THE FREAKS AND WEIRDOS OF THE WORLD – FROM PUNKS, GOTHS, AND GRUNGERS, TO SKINHEADS AND EMOS – FOR CLOSE TO A CENTURY, BUT IN OUR CAPITALISM-RAVISHED WORLD YOU’D PROBABLY EXPECT IT TO RUN A MILE AT THE PREMISE OF A SECOND COLLAB GIVEN THE SATANIC PANIC THE LAST ONE SPARKED. BUT INSTEAD, THE LABEL PUT ITS MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS, INVITING OWENS BACK FOR ROUND TWO. NOW, HE’S FLEXING HIS DESIGN MUSCLES AS PART OF THE FIRST WAVE OF 14XX – A NEW INCUBATOR LAUNCHED AT THE BACK END OF 2023, WHICH FOCUSES ON INNOVATIVE, FASHION FORWARD DESIGN AND TECH. THIS TIME AROUND, OWENS HAS CRANKED THE DIAL UP CLOSER TO 11, DEBUTING A TRUE STOMPER OF A STYLE. WITH A MASSIVE, HEAVY DUTY SOLE AND THE SIGNATURE ‘MEGALACE’ SYSTEM THAT LITTERS THE FOOTWEAR OF HIS MAINLINE COLLECTIONS – SERIOUSLY, DO NOT TAKE THESE OUT UNLESS YOU’RE DEEPLY SKILLED IN SHIBARI OR SIMILAR – THE DESIGNER REVEALED HE WANTED TO GO HARDER, BETTER, FASTER, STRONGER WHEN IT CAME TO REUNITING WITH DR MARTENS. THAT HE’D NEED SOMETHING SO HEAVY DUTY MAKES SENSE, SINCE, WHEN ASKED WHERE HE’D WANT TO WEAR THEM, HE REVEALS “TO DANCE NAKED IN THE WOODS AT MIDNIGHT TO SISSY MISFIT”. HIS KISS BOOTS MIGHT BE GREAT FOR POUNDING THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS, BUT TRAMPING THROUGH MULCHY LEAVES AND CLAMBERING THROUGH THICKETS? PROBABLY NOT SO MUCH. SISSY MISFIT, IN CASE YOU’RE WONDERING, IS THE STAR OF OWENS’ 14XX CAMPAIGN. THE ISTANBUL-BORN, LONDON-BASED MUSICIAN IS CURRENTLY LIGHTING UP DANCEFLOORS WITH HER EAR-SHATTERING, TOOTH-LOOSENING TECHNO SETS AND TRACKS LIKE “LULLABY”, AND CAUGHT THE DESIGNER’S ATTENTION ON INSTAGRAM. “ISN’T INSTAGRAM GREAT FOR THAT?” OWENS ENTHUSES. A DM SLIDE HAPPENED SOON AFTER, AND THE REST, AS THEY SAY, IS HISTORY – THE TWO FIRST MET ON SHOOT DAY AND IMMEDIATELY CLICKED CREATIVELY AND PERSONALLY. HERE, AS OWENS’ 14XX AND THE CAMPAIGN ITSELF GET THEIR DEBUT, THE DESIGNER HIMSELF AND SISSY MISFIT DIAL IN TO DISCUSS WEIRD TRIPS, WEARING KNOCK-OFF DMS, AND WHY ED BANGER SHOULD ABSOLUTELY SIGN THE RISING TECHNO STAR – CALL HER, IF YOU’RE READING XOXO. SO FIRST OF ALL, RICK – WHY DID YOU ASK SISSY TO BE THE STAR OF THIS CAMPAIGN? RICK OWENS: I REACHED OUT TO BECAUSE I WANTED TO CELEBRATE A RAW AND FEROCIOUS SELF-INVENTED ABANDON LIKE SISSY MISFIT, WHO BLASTS TECHNO WITH TRANS POWER. EVERY CREATIVE GESTURE IS A COMPOSITION OF CODES AND ASSOCIATIONS AND HOW IT’S PRESENTED. THIS IS JUST A SHOE. BUT IT’S A SHOE BRAND WITH A CERTAIN QUALITY SOMEHOW EMBRACED BY UNDERGROUND SUBCULTURE FOR A LONG TIME, ENDORSED BY A SLEAZY DESIGNER WITH A PISS-DRINKING HISTORY WHO USES IT AS AN EXCUSE TO ROPE A TECHNO TRANS JAGUAR TO CORRUPT THE WORLD. SOMEONE JUST ASKED ME ‘WHAT DOES THE 14XX MEAN TO YOU?’ AND I SAID “I JUST WANT [TO WEAR THEM]] TO DANCE NAKED IN THE WOODS AT MIDNIGHT TO SISSY MISFIT.” SISSY MISFIT: I LOVE THAT! [LAUGHS] HOW DID YOU TWO FIRST MEET? RICK OWENS: I REACHED OUT TO HER ON INSTAGRAM – ISN’T INSTAGRAM GREAT FOR THAT? I JUST SAID “HI, RICK OWENS HERE, I’M A FASHION DESIGNER IN PARIS. WOULD YOU CONSIDER DOING SOME PICTURES WITH ME FOR DOC MARTENS?” SISSY MISFIT: IT HAPPENED EXACTLY LIKE THAT! BUT OF COURSE I KNEW OF RICK AND RICK’S WORK BECAUSE I’M A GOTH AT HEART MYSELF – I’VE ALWAYS LOOKED TO DARK DESIGN, DARK DESIGNERS, MUSIC, AND ART. IT WAS SUCH A SURPRISE TO RECEIVE THAT MESSAGE! RICK OWENS: I DON&#39;T REALLY GO THROUGH PEOPLE. I&#39;M A LITTLE OFFENDED WHEN PEOPLES’ SECRETARIES REACH OUT TO ME BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY DIRECTLY. I FOUND A LOT OF PEOPLE ON INSTAGRAM THAT I&#39;VE JUST REACHED OUT TO DIRECTLY. I REACHED OUT TO ANTHROMOPRH, I REACHED OUT TO SALVIA, I REACHED OUT TO FECAL MATTER, I REACHED OUT TO GENA MARVIN. THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT I ADMIRE FOR CREATING SUCH A POWERFUL IDENTITY AND STICKING WITH IT AND COMMITTING TO IT. I&#39;M ALWAYS SO IMPRESSED WITH THAT, I ALWAYS WANT TO CELEBRATE THAT, I ALWAYS WANT TO CELEBRATE SOMEBODY THAT COMPLETELY LIVES THEIR AESTHETIC UNAPOLOGETICALLY. I CAN SEE HOW IT CAN BACKFIRE WHERE PEOPLE ASSUME I&#39;M A BIG COMPANY THAT&#39;S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE. I KIND OF GET THAT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, SHOULD I STOP? SHOULD I NOT DO THAT? SHOULD I NOT CELEBRATE THESE PEOPLE? IT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS A GIMMICK OR AS A STUNT, BUT THE MAIN THING FOR ME IS TO CELEBRATE CREATIVE JAGUARS, LIKE SISSY. I DON’T THINK IT FEELS LIKE A GIMMICK OR A STUNT AT ALL, BUT EVEN IF IT WAS, IT’S STILL A GOOD WAY TO USE THE PLATFORM YOU HAVE TO UPLIFT YOUNG CREATIVES. SISSY, WHAT WAS IT LIKE WORKING WITH RICK ON THE SHOOT? : SISSY MISFIT: RICK&#39;S DESIGNS ALWAYS FELT SO MONUMENTAL AND KIND OF COLD WHEN I’D LOOK AT THEM ONLINE OR SEE THEM IN MAGAZINES. STEPPING ON TO THE SET TO SHOOT THE CAMPAIGN FELT KIND OF LIKE ENTERING A BRUTALIST BUILDING? HIS WORK GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT [WORKING WITH HIM] BECAUSE, AS AN INDEPENDENT ARTIST, I NEVER DID ANY WORK OF THIS CALIBRE BEFORE. I’D NEVER STEPPED OUT OF MUSIC, SO I WAS NERVOUS! BUT JUST BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF RICK AND HIS TEAM AND WORKING TOGETHER I FELT SO WELCOME – THERE WAS THIS WARM ENERGY YOU DON’T REALLY EXPECT WHEN YOU HEAR IN THE MEDIA AND FROM FRIENDS WHAT IT’S LIKE WORKING WITH BIG DESIGNERS AND FASHION HOUSES. IT WAS LIKE TWO FRIENDS JUST TALKING AND TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME MEETING. CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE FIRST PAIR OF DOCS YOU OWNED? SISSY MISFIT: WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN TURKEY I WAS ALWAYS PART OF THE PUNK OR GOTH SCENE, SO WAS OBSESSED WITH DMS FROM BEING ABOUT 14 OR 15, BUT THEY DIDN’T REALLY EXIST IN MY COUNTRY – IT WAS ONLY KIDS WHOSE PARENTS HAD TRAVELLED TO EUROPE AND BROUGHT THEM BACK THAT WOULD BE WEARING THEM. SO MY FIRST PAIR WERE ACTUALLY KNOCK-OFFS THAT I BEGGED MY FATHER TO BUY ME FROM THIS LITTLE UNDERGROUND SHOP IN TURKEY. MY FIRST REAL PAIR I DIDN’T GET UNTIL I WAS ABOUT 18 WHEN I CAME TO LONDON TO VISIT. I REMEMBER WEARING THEM AND BEING IN A LOT OF PAIN, BUT I JUST LOVED THEM. RICK OWENS: I GUESS I MUST HAVE BEEN IN MY EARLY 20S BECAUSE I WAS LIVING IN LA. I’D JUST MOVED TO LA TO GO TO ART SCHOOL AND I GOT THEM AT THE STORE CALLED COWBOYS AND POODLES ON MELROSE. I DON&#39;T REMEMBER THEM BEING THAT HARD TO BREAK. I HAD THEM FOR A LONG TIME – THEY WERE MY BASIC STAPLE AND THEY WERE THE ONES THAT LACED KIND OF HIGH UP THE ANKLE. I&#39;VE SAID THIS BEFORE, BUT ON CERTAIN GUYS IT&#39;S ALMOST LIKE A CORSET. IF YOU HAVE MUSCULAR CALVES, IT KIND OF EMPHASISES THEM, AND I WONDER IF THAT&#39;S PART OF THE APPEAL. THE CORSETRY ELEMENT OF THEM. AT SOME POINT, I CUT THEM A LITTLE BIT LOWER. I WORE THEM FOR A REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LONG TIME. I HAVE NO IDEA WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THEM. RICK, YOU GOT A LOT OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, AND ACTUALLY ALSO THE PRESS, RILED UP WITH YOUR DR MARTENS COLLABORATION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO – PEOPLE WERE FROTHING AT THE MOUTH ABOUT THOSE PENTAGRAM LACES, AS WELL AS THE ONES YOU PUT ON THE PANTS ON YOUR AW21 RUNWAY. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE FURORE? RICK OWENS: I WAS DELIGHTED TO PROVOKE JUST THE PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO PROVOKE. USING A PENTAGRAM IS KIND OF LIKE A GENTLE HECKLE TO A POPULATION OR A SEGMENT OF OUR WORLD, THAT IS WHAT I CONSIDER BIGOTED, DISAPPROVING, AND INTOLERANT. PEOPLE USE THE WORD SATANIC ABOUT ME, AND DO PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVE IN SATAN? I MEAN, IS THAT A JOKE? BUT I GET IT – PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSERVATIVE AND HAVE A CERTAIN SET OF VALUES THAT ARE VERY SEVERE IN JUDGING AND AFFRONTED BY ANYTHING THAT CHALLENGES THAT. I JUST THINK IT&#39;S KIND OF FUNNY TO PROVOKE, BECAUSE THAT&#39;S KIND OF BEEN MY MISSION SINCE DAY ONE. TO BLUR THE LINES OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT IS WHAT IS TOLERATED. I WAS NOT TOLERATED AS A YOUNG SISSY, GROWING UP IN A SMALL CONSERVATIVE TOWN, AND THE RESPONSE TO ME WAS HOSTILE. WHEN I GREW UP, I ACCEPTED THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE AS PART OF THE GLORY AND THE DISAPPOINTMENTS OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. THAT INTOLERANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE, AND IT&#39;S NEVER GOING AWAY. BUT I CAN BE PART OF THE BALANCE OF THINGS. BY PROMOTING CHEERFUL PERVERSITY, I CAN BE PART OF MAINTAINING A BALANCE IN THE WORLD THAT OPPOSES INTOLERANCE. THAT&#39;S WHAT ARTISTS LIKE SISSY MISFIT DO TO BALANCE THE WORLD OUT, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT THING. WHEN I USE PENTAGRAMS, IT IS ABOUT OTHERNESS. IT IS ABOUT CELEBRATING THE FREAK IN ALL OF US, OR THE YOUNG FREAKS OUT THERE WHO NEED SUPPORT AND WHO NEED ENCOURAGEMENT AND WHO NEED RECOGNITION. SO I KNOW THAT WHEN I USE PENTAGRAMS, IT&#39;S A POKE. IT&#39;S A POKE AT THE CONSERVATIVE AND JUDGING ELEMENT METHOD THAT WE ALL LIVE WITH, AND IT DOESN&#39;T REALLY DO ANYTHING EXCEPT HELP MAINTAIN BALANCE TO ME. THAT&#39;S ONE OF MY VALUES. DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE CONSPIRACY THEORY – EITHER ONE YOU’RE SO INCREDULOUS ANYONE COULD BELIEVE, OR ONE YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF? SISSY MISFIT: I DON’T REALLY BUY INTO CONSPIRACY THEORIES, BUT SOMETIMES WHEN I WIND DOWN AND RELAX I’LL SMOKE A SPLIFF AND START IMAGINING THE PLANETS ARE LITTLE BLOOD CELLS AND WE ARE ALL JUST GOING THROUGH THE VEINS OF A HUGE BODY. LIKE I’M JUST A LITTLE PARTICLE ORBITING A HUGE BODY [LAUGHS]. RICK OWENS: THAT SOUNDS REALLY HEALTHY TO ME, BECAUSE YOU&#39;RE CONSIDERING YOURSELF AS A SMALL ELEMENT OF SOMETHING LARGER THAN YOURSELF, WHICH IS MODEST, WHICH IS REALISTIC. CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND IT&#39;S A COMMUNITY, I THINK THAT&#39;S KIND OF LOVELY. THAT&#39;S A CONSPIRACY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. I THINK THAT&#39;S A GREAT ATTITUDE. SISSY MISFIT: IT GETS SCARY WHEN YOU OVERTHINK IT THOUGH. LIKE, WHOSE BODY ARE WE IN? RICK OWENS: WELL YEAH, THAT&#39;S EVERYBODY&#39;S BIGGEST FEAR. I FIRST TRIED EDIBLES DURING LOCKDOWN IN LOS ANGELES. MY MOTHER WAS ABOUT TO START CHEMOTHERAPY SO I HAD TO QUARANTINE FOR TWO WEEKS BECAUSE OF COVID. SO I WAS IN THE CHATEAU MARMONT BY MYSELF, AND I BOUGHT THIS BIG BAG OF EDIBLES WITH THE INTENTION OF SLIPPING SOME TO MY MOTHER – OTHERWISE SHE’D BE TERRIFIED, SHE’S AFRAID OF BECOMING ADDICTED TO ASPIRIN. ANYWAY, I TRIED THE WRONG ONES – I THINK I GOT THE THC ONES BY MISTAKE – AND I GOT SO HIGH AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT THAT I THOUGHT “OH THIS IS WHY I DON’T SMOKE POT OR ANYTHING ANY MORE.” I’M ALREADY A PESSIMIST, SO WHEN I GET HIGH I JUST THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT’S WRONG AND HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF “NO NO, YOU’RE JUST HIGH STUPID, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER” OVER AND OVER BEFORE GOING DOWN ANOTHER DARK RABBIT HOLE AGAIN. I’LL HAVE TO TRY AGAIN, THOUGH, WITH THE OTHER ONE… CBD? I’VE BEEN BUYING CBD OIL IN ITALY BUT IT DOESN’T DO ANYTHING. SOMEBODY WILL HAVE TO BRING ME SOME GUMMIES FROM THE STATES OR BERLIN OR AMSTERDAM OR SOMETHING. SISSY MISFIT: YEAH CBD IS MORE ON THE LIKE RELAXING SIDE AND THC IS MORE ON THE PSYCHEDELIC, HIGH SIDE. RICK OWENS: I REMEMBERED WHY I DON’T DO PSYCHEDELICS ANY MORE IN LOCKDOWN ALSO. MICHELE [LAMY] AND I, DURING THE FIRST COVID LOCKDOWN, THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A NICE TIME TO REVISIT ACID AND MUSHROOMS. SO WE DID THAT IN THE GARDEN TOGETHER AND IT WAS ACTUALLY LOVELY. BUT THEN WE WERE ON ACID AND I REMEMBERED YOU CAN’T JUST STOP. AFTER A LITTLE BIT I&#39;M KIND OF BORED AND I JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO NORMAL. YOU’RE BOTH BIG INTO YOUR TECHNO, AND MORE BROADLY MUSIC IN GENERAL. WHAT ARE YOU OBSESSED WITH LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW? SISSY MISFIT:I&#39;VE BEEN REVISITING THE BACK CATALOGUE OF ED BANGER RECORDS. I AM OBSESSED WITH ED BANGER. WHEN I WAS PLAYING A SHOW IN PARIS, I KEPT TAGGING THEM ON MY STORIES AND BEING LIKE “COME TO MY SHOW! YOU NEED A TRANS GIRL ON YOUR ROSTER, IT&#39;S A BOYS CLUB!” I LOVE ELECTRO HOUSE. I’VE BEEN LISTENING TO IT A LOT RECENTLY. DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE ED BANGER TRACK AT THE MOMENT? SISSY MISFIT: I REALLY LOVE “DISMISSED” BY UFFIE. RICK OWENS: I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO UNICORN ON KETAMINE. IT&#39;S JUST LOUD, OBNOXIOUS, AND DELIRIOUS. I&#39;VE BEEN LISTENING TO THAT WHEN I WORK OUT OR JUST WHEN I WALK AROUND PARIS. BUT SOMETIMES IT’S THE ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE. I’VE ALSO BEEN LISTENING TO A LOT OF SHIRLEY HORN’S JAZZ – THIS REALLY SOFT, LOST LOVE, LOST YOUTH JAZZ. I HAVE IT ON A PLAYLIST CALLED ‘BOOZE’ THAT IS ALL TRAGIC ALCOHOLIC SOULS WHO&#39;VE LOST LOVE – LIKE JUDY GARLAND SINGING “THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY”. I WONDER WHY I&#39;M ATTRACTED TO IT AND THINKING “I WONDER IF IT&#39;S JUST BECAUSE I&#39;M GETTING OLDER” AND THERE&#39;S THIS KIND OF THIS SENSE OF ACCEPTANCE IN THIS KIND OF MUSIC, THIS KIND OF GRACEFUL ACCEPTANCE THAT APPEALS TO ME RIGHT NOW. ON THE ONE HAND, I LIKE THIS VICIOUS PRIMAL TECHNO AND ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVE GENTLE ACCEPTANCE. I THINK I NEED BOTH OF THEM. ALL OCCASIONS COVERED. WE’RE MULTIFACETED! WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO PARTY RIGHT NOW? SISSY MISFIT: THE DEFINITION OF THE BEST PARTY REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PERSON. FOR ME, THE BEST PARTY IS WHEN I&#39;M WITH MY MOST LOVED ONES. I DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT THE CLUB. I DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT THE SETTING. I DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT ISTANBUL WITH MY GIRLS WILL ALWAYS BE MY BEST PARTY, BECAUSE I FEEL MYSELF AND I FEEL THE MOST FUN AND LOVED AND SAFE WHEN I&#39;M WITH THEM. I’M NOT A HUGE PARTYGOER, I DON&#39;T REALLY RAVE THAT HARD, LIKE MAYBE ONCE A MONTH. SO I&#39;M NOT SURE I CAN&#39;T GIVE AN ANSWER LIKE “LONDON IS THE PLACE TO BE”, BECAUSE I DON&#39;T THINK IT IS. RICK OWENS: I MISSED YOUR SHOW IN PARIS SISSY, WAS IT GOOD? SISSY MISFIT: IT WAS REALLY CUTE. I REALLY ENJOYED IT. I WASN’T EXPECTING A REALLY RESPONSIVE CROWD FROM FRANCE, I DON’T KNOW WHY. RICK OWENS: PARIS DOESN&#39;T HAVE THE STRONGEST YOUTH CULTURE TO ME. THE YOUTH CULTURE IS VERY SAFE FROM WHAT I SEE, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I GO TO A PARTY IN PARIS. I USUALLY TAKE A DISCO NAP AND WAKE UP AROUND TWO IN THE MORNING, AND I HAVE AN ESPRESSO AND THEN I GO BY MYSELF AND I ENJOY IT. I NEVER REALLY KNOW WHERE I’M GOING. I HAVE THIS GUY THAT I CALL MY CONCIERGE AND HE UPDATES ME. HE’LL SEND ME AN ADDRESS AND I’LL JUST GO. I&#39;VE BEEN TO SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS. IT’S ALWAYS KIND OF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS. THE LAST TIME I WENT OUT WAS LAST FASHION WEEK, TO CICCIOLINA. THAT’S ALWAYS A CUTE CLUB, IT’S A GOOD COMMUNITY. I GO AND I DANCE BY MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD. SISSY MISFIT: I LOVE THAT, I DO THAT TOO SOMETIMES. IT FEELS REALLY LIBERATING TO JUST GO TO A PARTY ON YOUR OWN AND STAND, SOAK IN THE MUSIC AND THE VIBE, AND JUST LEAVE WHENEVER YOU WANT TO. RICK OWENS: PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK YOU’RE BY YOURSELF, YOU’RE NOT WITH A POSSE? NOPE, JUST GOING OUT FOR A DANCE. SISSY, LAST TIME RICK AND I SPOKE, I ASKED HIM WHO WOULD PLAY HIM IN A MOVIE OF HIS LIFE AND RICK YOU ANSWERED CHER WITHOUT SKIPPING A BEAT, WHICH I LOVED AND THOUGHT WAS GREAT CASTING.: SISSY MISFIT: YOU’RE KIDDING ME, DID YOU SAY CHER? THIS IS INSANE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SAY CHER. THIS IS A COSMIC MOMENT FOR ME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I’VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT QUESTION [SENT OVER AHEAD OF THE CALL], LIKE “WHO WOULD IT BE” AND I WAS THINKING CHER. SHE LOVES WIGS AND HAS A DISTINCTIVE FACIAL FEATURE. RICK OWENS: SORRY, SHE’S TAKEN! SISSY MISFIT: OK, MY OTHER ANSWER WILL BE ANGELINA JOLIE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HER TRY. RICK OWENS: THAT’S GOOD, THAT WOULD BE BETTER. MAYBE IT COULD BE KIND OF THE BOB DYLAN BIOPIC I’M NOT THERE -IN-REVERSE VIBES. CHER COULD PLAY BOTH OF YOU. RICK OWENS: I’VE NEVER SEEN THAT, BUT I SHOULD. SOMEBODY GET WORD TO CHER’S PEOPLE. SISSY MISFIT: I THINK SHE’D BE DOWN. WHAT ERA IN HISTORY WOULD YOU MOST LOVE TO GO BACK TO? SISSY MISFIT: I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY LATE 90S, EARLY 2000S, BECAUSE FOR ME, IN ART, MUSIC, PHOTOGRAPHY, THERE IS A SENSE OF IT BEING REALLY EXPERIMENTAL BUT CLASSY AND THERE’S THIS REAL ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND EXECUTION IN EVERYTHING. I’M OBSESSED WITH HOW THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THE FUTURE. I’M REALLY NOSTALGIC ABOUT THAT TIME AND EACH PIECE OF ART CREATED IN THAT MIDDLE ERA IS SO FASCINATING TO ME, I WOULD LOVE TO BE THERE. RICK OWENS:: I WOULD DO THE 1930S, JUST BECAUSE I LIKE THE AESTHETIC. AS FAR AS PEOPLE’S RIGHTS AND TOLERANCE GO, IT PROBABLY WASN’T THE BEST TIME FOR THAT. BUT JUST FOR PURE AESTHETICS, THAT’S ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVOURITE PERIOD IN FURNITURE AND FASHION AND ART. WHAT ARE YOUR INS AND OUTS FOR 2024? SISSY MISFIT: IN IS JUST DOLL DOMINATION ALL OVER THE WORLD. TRANS GIRL SUPREMACY! OUT IS INFLUENCER CULTURE, ESPECIALLY IN MUSIC. RICK OWENS: TOLERANCE IS IN, WAR IS OUT.

ON A DREARY NOVEMBER DAY IN PARIS, THE SOFT MORNING LIGHT IS CREEPING INTO THE AMERICAN FASHION DESIGNER RICK OWENS’S 18TH-CENTURY MANSION, JUST SOUTH OF THE SEINE IN THE SEVENTH ARRONDISSEMENT, WHERE HE AND HIS FRENCH WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER, MICHELE LAMY, 80, HAVE LIVED FOR 20 YEARS. ONE OF THE FEW TRULY INDEPENDENT CREATIVE HEADS OF A MAJOR BRAND, HE’S BUILT AN IMPROBABLE EMPIRE BY MAKING CLOTHES AS GROTESQUE AS THEY ARE GLAMOROUS. BUT THREE DECADES INTO HIS CAREER — AND A FEW DAYS AFTER TURNING 62 — OWENS FINDS HIMSELF AT A CROSSROADS. HE’S JUST RETURNED FROM A BIRTHDAY TRIP TO THE PACIFIC COAST OF JALISCO, MEXICO, WHERE HE RODE HORSES WITH HIS MUSE, DESIGN ASSISTANT AND FREQUENT TRAVEL COMPANION, THE TOWERING 30-SOMETHING AUSTRALIAN MODEL TYRONE DYLAN SUSMAN, WHOSE INSTAGRAM FEED HAS ALSO SHOWN THEM AMONG GREEK RUINS, IN THE DUBAI DESERT AND ON BEACHES AROUND THE WORLD (WHERE THEY’VE BEEN KNOWN TO WEAR MATCHING BASEBALL HATS WITH EACH OTHER’S NAMES ON THEM). NOW THAT OWENS IS BACK, HE AND LAMY, A 5-FOOT-2 AGENT OF CREATIVE CHAOS WITH KOHL-RIMMED ELECTRIC BLUE EYES, GOLD-PLATED TEETH AND TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, HAVE BEEN OVERSEEING THEIR LATEST PROJECT: RELOCATING THE RICK OWENS MEN’S AND WOMEN’S RUNWAY SHOWS, NORMALLY STAGED IN THE MONUMENTAL COURTYARD AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, A NEO-CLASSICAL-STYLE STRUCTURE HOUSING TWO MUSEUMS WITH STONE COLONNADES AND A LARGE REFLECTING POOL, TO THEIR LIVING ROOM. “I THINK IT’S BECOME TOO BOMBASTIC,” HE SAYS OF THE PALAIS DE TOKYO SHOWS AS HE SCANS THE GUTTED FIRST FLOOR OF WHAT WAS ONCE THE FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS. (WHEN HE AND LAMY ARRIVED IN 2004, THE FIVE-STORY TOWNHOUSE HAD BEEN SITTING EMPTY FOR TWO DECADES; TODAY, ITS CHALKY WALLS AND FLOORS — NOT PART OF AN ONGOING RENOVATION BUT THE FINISHED PRODUCT — CONJURE A SQUAT MORE THAN A RESIDENCE.) “SUBLIMINALLY, I THINK I’VE BEEN DESIGNING COLLECTIONS TO MATCH [THE PALAIS’S] GRANDEUR.” HIS EXTRAVAGANT PRODUCTIONS, OFTEN PRESENTED AGAINST A SKY OF COLORFUL SMOKE BOMBS OR AMID FLAME-ENGULFED PYRES FOR HUNDREDS OF “FREAKS,” “WEIRDOS” AND “MESSY QUEENS,” AS HE AFFECTIONATELY REFERS TO HIS LOYAL FOLLOWERS, HAVE INCORPORATED STEP DANCERS (SPRING 2014), EXPOSED PENISES (FALL 2015) AND WOMEN HARNESSED TO EACH OTHER (SPRING 2016). THE NEW LOCATION, THOUGH SMALLER, ISN’T WITHOUT ITS OWN SENSE OF SPECTACLE: NEAR WHERE THE FORMER FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANÇOIS MITTERRAND’S DESK USED TO BE IS A BIG STACK OF FELT MADE FROM HUMAN HAIR BY THE SERBIAN ARTIST ZORAN TODOROVIC; TWO BLACK PLYWOOD CHAIRS WITH ANTLERS FROM THE RICK OWENS FURNITURE LINE; AND, ATOP A PLINTH IN A PLEXIGLASS CASE, A 1.3-GALLON ALUMINUM TANK CONTAINING THE SPERM OF THE ESTONIAN RAPPER TOMMY CASH. “IT’S EMPTY NOW,” SAYS LAMY, IN AN OFF-THE-SHOULDER BLACK RICK OWENS DRESS THAT MATCHES HER INK-DIPPED FINGERS. “WE’RE WAITING FOR HIM TO DROP SOME MORE OFF.” OWENS IS WEARING A BLACK SKULLCAP, BLACK SLOUCHY COTTON SHORTS AND BLACK LEATHER SNEAKERS WITH THICK WHITE RUBBER SOLES, ALL DESIGNED BY HIM. THE PLATFORM HEELS HE OFTEN WEARS MAKE HIM SEEM MUCH TALLER THAN 5-FOOT-10. WHEN THE COUPLE’S FRENCH ARCHITECT, DAVID LECLERC, TELLS HIM IT’S LIKELY NOT POSSIBLE TO SWITCH OUT A WHITE ENAMEL RADIATOR FOR A STAINLESS-STEEL ALTERNATIVE, OWENS AGREES TO SETTLE FOR SOMETHING EQUALLY “DELICIOUS.” (HE USES THE SAME WORD TO DESCRIBE THE NIGHTLY FOOTFALLS OF THE GUARDS — “DADDY,” HE CALLS THEM — PATROLLING THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE NEXT DOOR.) LECLERC FROWNS: IT’LL BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO INSTALL THE MIRRORED WALLS AND INDOOR ROCK GARDEN IN TIME FOR MEN’S FASHION WEEK IN JANUARY. (THEIR EXCHANGE RECALLS THE 1966 “ADDAMS FAMILY” EPISODE IN WHICH MORTICIA ADDAMS, HAVING INSISTED ON DECORATING HER NEIGHBORS’ HOME, TALKS ABOUT ADORNING THE WALLS IN SALMON. “PINK?” THEY ASK HOPEFULLY. “NO,” MORTICIA REPLIES. “SCALES.”) BUT CONSTRUCTION SITES MERELY MAKE OWENS NOSTALGIC FOR HIS EARLY DAYS IN PARIS, WHEN HE AND LAMY WORKED OUT OF “A FILTHY BARN KIND OF THING” WITH A SINGLE TURKISH TOILET IN THE BASTILLE AREA. “EVERYTHING WAS COVERED IN CONCRETE DUST. REMEMBER, HUN?” HE ASKS LAMY. (HE CALLS HER THAT, NOT UNFONDLY, BECAUSE, LIKE THE HUNS, HE SAYS, “SHE’S A MARAUDING, AX-WIELDING PRIMITIVE FORCE OF NATURE WHO TAKES WHAT SHE WANTS AND THEN THROWS A LIT MATCH BEHIND HER.”) “IT WAS LOOKING SO GOOD,” SHE REPLIES WITH A GRIN. DESPITE THEIR MANY SIMILARITIES, OWENS AND LAMY ARE ALSO VERY DIFFERENT. THE ENGLISH FASHION DESIGNER GARETH PUGH, OWENS’S FORMER PROTÉGÉ, SAYS, “MICHÈLE HAS THIS NOMADIC HUSTLING MENTALITY. RICK’S VERY HAPPY TO KEEP HIS HEAD DOWN AND DO THE WORK.” OWENS APPRECIATES CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY, IF ONLY FOR THE THRILL OF PERVERTING IT; LAMY REJECTS IT ALTOGETHER. HIS DRESSING ROOM IS APPOINTED WITH MIMOSA-SCENTED CANDLES, FRESH-CUT HORTENSIAS AND THROW PILLOWS; HERS HAS A PILE OF WET TOWELS ON THE FLOOR. THEIR OTHER TWO RESIDENCES — A MINIMALIST APARTMENT IN CONCORDIA SULLA SECCHIA, ITALY, NEAR THE FACTORY WHERE OWENS’S CLOTHES ARE MADE, AND AN EQUALLY AUSTERE BEACH HOUSE ON VENICE’S LIDO — ARE TOO BOURGEOIS FOR LAMY. “SHE’S LIKE, ‘I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHO THESE ARE FOR. WHO ARE YOU?’” SAYS OWENS. “SHE’S OFFENDED THAT THEY REFUTE OUR STORY TOGETHER.” THEIR LIFE DOES LOOK QUITE DIFFERENT THAN IT DID IN LOS ANGELES, WHERE THEY MET IN THE 1990S. THEY NO LONGER RESIDE IN A FORMER DISCOUNT STORE, WHAT OWENS DESCRIBES AS “A HOVEL,” OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. NOR DOES HE PUT BLEACH POWDER AROUND THEIR BED TO KEEP AWAY COCKROACHES, AS HE’D DONE WHEN HE WAS SINGLE. AT 40, OWENS STOPPED DRINKING AND TAKING HARD DRUGS. STILL, HE DOESN’T REGRET HAVING COMMITTED “TEMPORARY SUICIDE,” AS HE CALLS IT; IN THE DARKNESS, THERE WERE OFTEN BURSTS OF BEAUTY — SOMETHING THAT COULD ALSO BE SAID OF HIS CLOTHES. IN 2003, A YEAR AFTER WINNING THE CFDA PERRY ELLIS AWARD FOR EMERGING TALENT, HE BECAME THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTURIES-OLD FRENCH FUR COMPANY REVILLON FRÈRES AND THE COUPLE MOVED TO PARIS. IN 2006, HE LEFT THAT COMPANY AND OPENED HIS OWN BOUTIQUE IN THE PALAIS ROYAL ARCADE, WHERE THERE’S NOW AN ANATOMICALLY CORRECT WAX SCULPTURE OF HIM BEHIND THE CASH REGISTER. EVEN IN FASHION, AN INDUSTRY WITH NO SHORTAGE OF OUTSIZE PERSONALITIES, OWENS STANDS ALONE. THERE’S SOMETHING GENUINELY SUBVERSIVE ABOUT HOW HE’S BEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE EXTREMES: AS AN ICONOCLAST WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A SHREWD BUSINESSMAN; A CALIFORNIA NATIVE WHO’S BECOME A BELOVED FIXTURE IN PARIS WITHOUT REJECTING HIS AMERICANNESS; A SWEET BOY WITH A LEATHER KINK; AND AN ELDER STATESMAN WHO NURTURES YOUNGER TALENT AND SUPPORTS THE COMPETITION. THE FASHION DESIGNER DANIEL ROSEBERRY, 38, A FELLOW AMERICAN EXPAT IN PARIS, SAYS THAT OWENS WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE HIM FOLLOWING HIS 2019 DEBUT AT SCHIAPARELLI. “THERE’S A GENERAL FRIGIDITY IN THE WAY DESIGNERS RELATE TO EACH OTHER, ESPECIALLY ACROSS GENERATIONAL DIVIDES,” SAYS ROSEBERRY. “RICK HAS SUCH A UNIQUE WARMTH, WHICH IS DISARMING BECAUSE, OF COURSE, FROM THE OUTSIDE, THE WORLD THAT HE’S BUILT WITH MICHÈLE IS SO INTIMIDATING.” IT’S RAINING AS WE WANDER THE GROUNDS OF THE RODIN MUSEUM, WHERE OWENS LIKES TO ADMIRE THE SCULPTOR’S IDEALIZED BRONZE STUDIES OF THE HUMAN FORM. THE DESIGNER, WHO DYES HIS WHITE HAIR BLACK AND STRAIGHTENS ITS CURLS, HAS BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH GETTING OLDER. IN HIS 50S, HE FELT AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWER; NOW THAT HE’S BECOME AWARE OF HIS LOOMING 70S, HE’S CONFUSED ABOUT HOW BEST TO “CORRUPT THE WORLD,” AS HE PUTS IT. “HOW DO I WANT TO PLAY THIS SO THAT IT’S ELEGANT AND CONVINCING AND IT DOESN’T GET SILLY?” HE SAYS. “I’M OBSERVING MYSELF, THINKING, ‘AT SOME POINT, I’M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE: AM I GOING TO ACCEPT OR RESIST? AM I GOING TO PULL BACK OR BECOME EVEN MORE EXTREME?’” THERE ARE, HE ADDS, SOME DESIGNERS WHO DIDN’T KNOW WHEN TO REIN IT IN. “THEY’D REACHED A PEAK THEY COULDN’T MAINTAIN WITHOUT BECOMING A CARICATURE.” HE MENTIONS AN IDOL OF HIS, THIERRY MUGLER, THE FRENCH COUTURIER WHO, BEFORE HIS DEATH IN 2022, UNDERWENT MULTIPLE SURGERIES TO RESEMBLE A SUPERHERO; AND ALICE COOPER, THE ROCK STAR WHOSE STAGE ACT, WITH PYROTECHNICS AND RUMORED POULTRY SACRIFICES, NOW SEEMS QUAINT. BUT IN THE MID-1970S, WHEN OWENS FIRST DISCOVERED COOPER’S MUSIC, HE WAS SPELLBOUND. “HE WAS SCARY, AND I LOVED THAT,” HE SAYS. “AND NOW, OF COURSE, HE’S COMICAL.” MARLENE DIETRICH OFFERED ANOTHER ROAD MAP. “AFTER THE WAR, SHE WENT FROM BEING THIS GLAMOROUS, OBJECTIFIED THING TO A SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS ACTIVIST TO A REFINED ENTERTAINER,” HE SAYS. “HER CABARET ACT WAS AS CALCULATED AND CONTROLLED AS A DONALD JUDD INSTALLATION.” FOR 30 YEARS, OWENS’S CREATIONS — FROM THE MACHINE-WASHED ASYMMETRICAL LEATHER JACKET HE’S BEEN ITERATING SINCE THE BEGINNING TO A MORE RECENT BLACK CASHMERE CROP TOP WITH SHOULDERS AS POINTY AS DEVIL HORNS — HAVE BEEN AS MUCH ABOUT SEMIOTICS AS STATUS; TO PUT ON A RICK OWENS SEQUINED COWL (FALL 2023) OR KNEE-HIGH LEATHER STOCKING BOOTS (SPRING 2024) IS TO EXPRESS ONESELF IN A LANGUAGE NOT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS. MORE THAN ANYONE IN CONTEMPORARY FASHION, HE HAS EMERGED AS THE HEAD OF A TRIBE — NOT JUST A CULT DESIGNER BUT A CULT LEADER. SOME OF HIS MORE DEDICATED CLIENTS AND FANS INCLUDE THE FORMER C.E.O. OF TWITTER, JACK DORSEY; THE MUSICIAN LIL UZI VERT; AND CONSTANTINE KALOUTAS, A POSTHUMAN ARTIST KNOWN AS ἄNTHROMORPH. A DIVINITY IN DROP-CROTCH PANTS, OWENS HAS SHOWN PEOPLE ANOTHER WAY TO EXIST: AS AN EXAGGERATED VERSION OF THEIR TRUEST SELVES. “THERE’RE DESIGNERS WHO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND PASSIVELY ABSORB THE WORLD AROUND THEM AND THEN RESPOND. BUT THEN THERE ARE A FEW DESIGNERS LIKE RICK, WHO WAKE UP AND THINK, ‘THIS IS WHAT I STAND FOR,’” SAYS ROSEBERRY, WHO COMPARES OWENS TO THE SIMILARLY MYTHOLOGIZED REI KAWAKUBO, THE JAPANESE FOUNDER OF COMME DES GARÇONS. “IT’S SO WILDLY TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.” DESPITE HIS DEDICATION TO THE UNORTHODOX — OR MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE FREEDOM SUCH AN EXISTENCE ENTAILS — OWENS SEEMS MORE CONFIDENT, WITH FEWER NEUROSES, THAN MOST OTHER DESIGNERS. HIS FRIEND SHAYNE OLIVER, THE AMERICAN CO-FOUNDER OF THE STREETWEAR BRAND HOOD BY AIR, BELIEVES THAT WEARING RICK OWENS OFFERS A FANTASY OF COLLECTIVE NONCONFORMITY — “THE BLACK PICKET FENCE,” AS HE CALLS IT. “RICK SPEAKS TO ANOTHER VERSION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, THE SAME WAY RALPH LAUREN CREATED A COUNTRY CLUB OBSESSION,” SAYS OLIVER. “PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT SIZES: EVERYONE’S IN RICK BECAUSE HE’S ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR THEM. A LOT OF OTHER BRANDS ARE OBSESSED WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER. IN RICK’S WORLD, EVERYONE’S A MAIN CHARACTER.” ONE WONDERS HOW DIFFERENTLY TODAY’S AVANT-GARDE MIGHT DRESS IF OWENS HAD NEVER MADE IT TO FRANCE. HIS CLOTHES REFLECT A CONFLUENCE OF IDEAS AND INFLUENCES — THE DETACHED EASE OF GRUNGE; THE BRUTAL RESTRAINT OF THE AMERICAN ARTISTS MICHAEL HEIZER AND RICHARD SERRA; THE ROMANTIC DRAPERY OF THE 1920S AND ’30S FRENCH DESIGNERS MADELEINE VIONNET AND MADAME GRES; THE FLAMBOYANCE OF LARRY LEGASPI’S COSTUMES FOR 1970S MUSICAL ACTS LIKE GRACE JONES AND KISS — AND HAVE INSPIRED, CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT, A NEW GENERATION OF EXPERIMENTALISTS, INCLUDING DILARA FINDIKOGLU, DURAN LANTINK AND DION LEE, AS WELL AS MORE ESTABLISHED DESIGNERS SUCH AS HAIDER ACKERMANN AND FEAR OF GOD’S JERRY LORENZO. OWENS LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR A MORE INCLUSIVE AND AUDACIOUS MANNER OF DRESSING, AND A NEW TYPE OF UNIFORM, TOO, AS STRANGE AS IT IS VERSATILE: CLINGY, LANGUID OR SCULPTURAL, LARGELY GRAY-SCALE GARMENTS MADE FROM UNEXPECTED FABRICS SUCH AS SHREDDED DENIM, NYLON DUVETS AND WOOL BLANKETS, ALL OF IT DURABLE AND SURPRISINGLY WEARABLE. FOR ALL THEIR PECULIARITIES, THE GARMENTS ARE IMPECCABLY CONSTRUCTED. “IN SHADOW, IT COULD BE THE WORK OF CRISTOBAL BALENCIAGA,” SAYS OLIVER. “BUT THEN YOU TURN ON THE LIGHT AND IT’S RICK.” RICHARD SATURNINO OWENS WAS BORN IN PORTERVILLE, CALIF., A CONSERVATIVE TOWN AT THE EDGE OF THE SOUTHERN SIERRA NEVADA 160 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES. HIS FATHER, JOHN OWENS, DIDN’T ALLOW A TV IN THE HOUSE. INSTEAD, HE INTRODUCED OWENS TO ARISTOTLE AND THE MUSIC OF RICHARD WAGNER; HE ALSO TAUGHT HIM FEAR AND SHAME. “I AM KARMA,” HE SAYS. “I’M THE OPPOSITE RESULT OF MY DAD’S FORCE IN THE WORLD.” AT CATHOLIC SCHOOL, HE RELISHED THE STORIES OF THE SAINTS AND THEIR VESTMENTS. THEY WERE, ALONG WITH HIS MOTHER’S FREDERICK’S OF HOLLYWOOD LINGERIE CATALOGS, AMONG HIS ONLY SOURCES OF EXOTICISM. AND, OF COURSE, “THIS HOT, NAKED GUY ON A CROSS,” HE SAYS. OWENS HAS TAKEN ME TO THE CHURCH OF ST. CLOTILDE, A GOTHIC REVIVAL BASILICA CLOSE TO HIS HOME WHERE HE AND HIS LATE MOTHER, CONCEPCIÓN OWENS, A FORMER TEACHER’S AIDE, WOULD COME TO TALK; AND WHERE CONNIE, AS SHE WAS KNOWN, PRAYED FOR HER SON’S HAPPINESS. JOHN, A SOCIAL WORKER, DIED IN 2015. WHEN OWENS CALLED TO SAY GOODBYE, JOHN, WHO HADN’T SPOKEN TO HIS SON IN FOUR YEARS AFTER OWENS HAD DESCRIBED HIM AS BIGOTED IN AN INTERVIEW, YELLED, “IT’S TOO LATE!” AND HUNG UP. (OWENS LATER GOT HIM BACK ON THE PHONE FOR WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS “A SOFT ENDING.”) IN EVERY STORY HE SHARES ABOUT HIS FATHER, THE DESIGNER DESCRIBES A MORTAL ENEMY WHO COULD HAVE BEEN HIS BEST FRIEND. “WHEN YOUR PARENTS DIE, THERE’S A PRIMAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT YOU’RE NEXT,” SAYS OWENS, WHO FLEW HIS MOTHER TO CONCORDIA WHEN HER CANCER WORSENED. “I THOUGHT, ‘I HAVE TO GET HER TO EUROPE BEFORE SHE GETS STUCK IN A HOSPITAL.’ CONCORDIA IS OUR CENTER OF SURVIVAL, ALL OF US,” HE ADDS, SETTLING INTO A PEW. A WEEK BEFORE HER DEATH, IN 2022, CONNIE ASKED TO ACCOMPANY OWENS, HER ONLY CHILD, TO VENICE. “I WANT TO GO INTO THE WATER,” SHE SAID. OWENS REPLIED, “MOM, YOU’RE TERRIFIED OF THE WATER.” BUT SHE INSISTED. “I GOT HER IN THIS INFLATABLE WHEELCHAIR, AND SHE WAS SQUEALING. IT WAS THE CUTEST THING,” HE SAYS. “SHE DECLINED SHORTLY AFTER THAT.” A MOMENT PASSES AS WE SIT IN SILENCE. WHEN HE GLANCES AT ME, OWENS LOOKS LIKE HE’S BEEN CRYING. HE ASKS IF I’VE READ ANYTHING BY THE LATE 19TH-CENTURY FRENCH WRITER JORIS-KARL HUYSMANS, A MEMBER OF THE DECADENT LITERARY MOVEMENT WHO LATER CONVERTED TO CATHOLICISM. “IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME?” HE SAYS. “AM I GOING TO FIND SPIRITUALITY AT THE END?” FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN REMEMBER, OWENS HAS FELT THE PULL OF OPPOSING FORCES. ALTHOUGH HE GREW UP IN WHAT HE CALLS A “VERY OPPRESSIVE” COMMUNITY, HE CAME TO TERMS WITH HIS SEXUALITY EARLY ON. IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE AND A LESBIAN CLASSMATE WOULD WATCH “DARK SHADOWS” (1966-71), A TV SERIES ABOUT A WEALTHY FAMILY OF VAMPIRES AND OTHER SUPERNATURAL CHARACTERS LIVING IN MAINE — THEIR ODDNESS A SEMAPHORE FOR QUEERNESS. (HE LATER NAMED A LINE OF T-SHIRTS, JEANS AND SNEAKERS, DRKSHDW, AFTER IT.) AT AGE 15, OWENS SAW HIMSELF REFLECTED IN A DIFFERENT MONSTER: DAVID BOWIE, WHOSE “DIAMOND DOGS” (1974) ALBUM ART DEPICTS THE SINGER AS A CHIMERA — HALF-CANINE, HALF-MAN — WITH A ZIGGY STARDUST MULLET; HE WAS REPULSED AND AROUSED AT THE SAME TIME. “IF I COULD DO THAT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE,” HE RECALLS THINKING, “THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING.” WHEN HE WATCHED “THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW” (1975) A YEAR LATER, HE COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW: A TRANSYLVANIAN CROSS-DRESSER, A BEEFY HEARTTHROB AND A HUNCHBACK ALL LOSING THEIR MINDS TO THE MUSIC. “I THOUGHT, ‘THAT’S THE PARTY I WANT TO GO TO,’” HE SAYS. (DECADES LATER, LOOKING AT THE CROWD AT ONE OF HIS SHOWS, IT HIT HIM: “I DID IT,” HE THOUGHT. “I MADE THAT PARTY.”) AROUND 1981, WHEN OWENS MOVED TO LOS ANGELES TO STUDY PAINTING AT OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN — HE’D DROP OUT TO MASTER PATTERNMAKING AND DRAPING AT THE LOS ANGELES TRADE-TECHNICAL COLLEGE INSTEAD — HIS FATHER STARTED WRITING TO GAY ORGANIZATIONS, DEMANDING THAT THEY ANSWER FOR THE IMMORALITY OF THEIR EXISTENCE. “HE KEPT SENDING ME THIS STUFF, ALL TYPED ON BEAUTIFUL PARCHMENT PAPER,” SAYS OWENS, WHO’D PLANNED TO PUBLISH A BOOK OF THE LETTERS — WHAT HE NOW DESCRIBES AS “THE MOST POIGNANT RECORD OF A PARENT’S LOVE, MISGUIDED OR NOT” — AFTER HIS FATHER’S DEATH. THEN HE LOST THE MATERIAL IN A MOVE. “ALL OF DAD’S EFFORTS WASTED,” HE SAYS. “BUT THEY WERE WASTED FROM THE START.” (ALTHOUGH JOHN REGULARLY ATTENDED HIS SHOWS AND CONVERSED WITH DRAG QUEENS AT THE DINNERS THAT FOLLOWED, HE’D OFTEN SAY, “RICHARD, DON’T YOU KNOW ANY HETEROSEXUALS?”) IN 1990, OWENS HEARD ABOUT A JOB AS A PATTERNMAKER FOR LAMY, WHO HAD HER OWN LINE OF COTTON DRESSES AND SWEATER TUNICS. “I WORKED FOR HER FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE I GOT TO KNOW HER, BECAUSE HER ACCENT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND,” HE SAYS. “STILL IS.” WHEN THEY LATER FELL IN LOVE, LAMY DIVORCED HER THEN-HUSBAND, THE VIDEO ARTIST AND FILMMAKER RICHARD NEWTON, WITH WHOM SHE HAS ONE DAUGHTER, THE INTERDISCIPLINARY ARTIST SCARLETT ROUGE. “JUST WHEN MY PARENTS GOT USED TO MY BEING GAY,” SAYS OWENS, SHAKING HIS HEAD. TO CALL HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH LAMY A PARTNERSHIP IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT; THEY MELDED INTO A SINGLE ENTITY. FOR A WHILE, HE ASSUMED HE’D BECOME THE NEXT CHARLES JAMES, A BRITISH AMERICAN DESIGNER WHO MADE BALL GOWNS IN PARIS BEGINNING IN THE 1930S. OWENS, WHO FIGHTS THE URGE TO PRODUCE ATTRACTIVE THINGS — “I’M A LITTLE ASHAMED THAT, UNDERNEATH IT ALL, FUNDAMENTALLY, I RESPOND TO CLASSICAL BEAUTY,” HE SAYS — WAS, LIKE JAMES, “KIND OF SLEAZY, A LITTLE OBSCURE AND WORKING IN SQUALOR.” LAMY HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA. BY THE EARLY ’90S, SHE’D CLOSED HER FASHION LINE AND WAS RUNNING A POPULAR FRENCH BISTRO IN LOS ANGELES WHILE HELPING OWENS BUILD HIS BRAND, WHICH AT THE TIME CONSISTED MOSTLY OF T-SHIRTS AND SKIRTS MADE FROM THE REMNANTS OF DISCARDED COTTON AND SILK. ALTHOUGH HE HAD SUPPORT FROM THE RIGHT STORES, LIKE BARNEYS NEW YORK AND HENRI BENDEL, HE NEEDED MORE OUTSIDE HELP. IN 2001, HE SIGNED A DEAL WITH EBA, AN ITALIAN SALES AGENCY THAT EXPANDED HIS RETAIL PRESENCE, AND THREE YEARS LATER HE ESTABLISHED OWENSCORP, THE UMBRELLA COMPANY UNDER WHICH HE OPERATES RICK OWENS AND HIS OTHER LINES: DRKSHDW, HUNRICKOWENS (FUR), LILIES (JERSEY GARMENTS) AND HUNROD (FINE JEWELRY). “FROM EARLY ON, I HAD PARTNERS WHO KNEW HOW TO PROTECT ME,” HE SAYS. “NOBODY GETS THE CHANCE TO EVOLVE ANYMORE.” THESE DAYS, CREATIVE DIRECTORS SELDOM STAY ANYWHERE LONG ENOUGH TO LEAVE A MARK. AND WHILE HIS CLOTHES AREN’T FOR EVERYONE — “THOSE RICK OWENS LOOK LIKE CLOWN SHOES, I’M SORRY,” READS ONE SOCIAL MEDIA POST — HE FREQUENTLY COLLABORATES WITH SUCH BRANDS AS ADIDAS AND CHAMPION. “IT ALLOWS ME TO SNEAK PENTAGRAMS INTO ALL THESE DIFFERENT CLOSETS,” HE SAYS. (ANNUAL REVENUE LAST YEAR AT OWENSCORP, OF WHICH OWENS AND LAMY ARE THE PRINCIPAL OWNERS, WAS MORE THAN $140 MILLION.) BEHIND THE SCENES, LAMY WAS CONSTANTLY URGING OWENS TO EXPLORE HIS GRITTY SIDE. “I’D MAKE CLOTHES AND LEAVE THEM LYING AROUND. WHATEVER SHE RESPONDED TO, I’D DEVELOP,” OWENS SAYS, ADDING, “I NEED HER IN MY ORBIT BECAUSE SHE REMINDS ME TO GO FURTHER, TO GET MORE RAW.” WHEN LAMY STARTED WEARING MORE COMME DES GARÇONS, HE CONFRONTED HER ABOUT IT. “YOUR CLOTHES JUST DON’T MAKE ME FEEL POWERFUL ENOUGH,” HE RECALLS HER SAYING. “ALL OF A SUDDEN, I STARTED MAKING CLOTHES THAT WERE MORE EXAGGERATED.” IN A SENSE, OWENS’S RECENT STRUGGLE OVER HOW TO PRESENT HIMSELF — TO AVOID, AS HE’D PUT IT, BECOMING COMICAL — IS ALSO A FRIENDLY BATTLE WITH LAMY. FOR HIS SPRING 2024 COLLECTION LAST SEPTEMBER, MODELS EMERGED TO THE SWELL OF DIANA ROSS SINGING, “I STILL BELIEVE IN LOVE.” THE CLOTHES, WHICH INCLUDED FLOWING PINK GAZAR GOWNS WITH BILLOWING SILK CAPES, SUMMONED 1930S HOLLYWOOD. ONE JOURNALIST, SURPRISED BY THE “DOWNRIGHT PRETTY” DRESSES, WONDERED, “DID PARIS’S PRINCE OF DARKNESS FIND THE LIGHT?” OWENS SAYS LAMY, HIS MOST TRUSTED CRITIC, IS CONSTANTLY PULLING HIM BACK TO THE DARK SIDE (EVEN IF, AT THIS POINT, THE ULTIMATE SUBVERSION MIGHT BE TO MAKE SOMETHING SWEET). “SHE ALWAYS SAYS THE SAME THING, AND I BELIEVE IT,” HE SAYS. “IT’S, ‘YOU’RE NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH,’ OR, ‘YOU’RE GETTING TOO POLISHED.’” THE LOUISIANA-BORN ARTIST PAUL SOILEAU, KNOWN FOR HIS DEMONIC DRAG PERSONA, CHRISTEENE, WHICH HE REFERS TO AS “MICHÈLE’S SISTER OR HOUSE CAT,” DESCRIBES THE COUPLE’S RELATIONSHIP AS “OPEN,” “UNDERSTANDING” AND “SUSTAINABLE.” (IN 2017, OWENS AND LAMY APPEARED IN THE VIDEO FOR CHRISTEENE’S SONG “BUTT MUSCLE”; IT WAS OWENS’S IDEA FOR THE PERFORMER TO URINATE IN HIS MOUTH.) “FROM BIRTH,” SOILEAU SAYS, “MOST OF US ARE TAUGHT HOW TO PRESENT IN SOCIETY. IT’S RARE WHEN YOU COME ACROSS TWO PEOPLE WHO’VE CONSTRUCTED THEIR OWN WAY OF LIVING. THERE’S A LOT TO BE LEARNED FROM HOW THEY FUNCTION IN THIS MAD WORLD.” YET IN RECENT YEARS, THE MAINSTREAM SEEMS TO BE CATCHING UP TO OWENS. “WITH PEOPLE LIKE RICK,” SAYS ROSEBERRY, “THE WORLD IS SOMETIMES MORE IN SYNC WITH THEM THAN OTHER TIMES. AND I THINK WE’RE AT PEAK SYNC WITH RICK RIGHT NOW.” BUT SUCH POPULARITY COMES WITH COMPLICATIONS. IT’S HARD TO KEEP TOPPLING THE ESTABLISHMENT WHEN YOU’VE BEEN ACCEPTED BY IT. LATER THAT AFTERNOON, OWENS, RESTED FROM HIS DAILY ONE-HOUR NAP, IS ON A GRAY SOFA LISTENING TO CHER IN HIS HOME OFFICE, A SPARSE SHOWROOM WITH POURED CONCRETE FLOORS AND FLUORESCENT LIGHTING. THERE’S THE FAINT SMELL OF ROAST CHICKEN COMING FROM THE KITCHEN; SOON, GUESTS WILL ARRIVE. ON HIS WHITE DESK, NEXT TO A HUMAN SKULL, ARE PICTURES FROM A RECENT FITTING OF HIS NEXT MEN’S COLLECTION. OWENS BEGINS EACH SEASON BY REVISITING OLD SILHOUETTES: HE MIGHT ADD MORE FABRIC TO AN ALREADY VOLUMINOUS CAPE OR DECIDE THAT A BACKLESS WOMEN’S DRESS LOOKS BETTER ON A MAN. HE POINTS TO A PAIR OF INFLATABLE THIGH-HIGH BOOTS HE’S BEEN WORKING ON, AND A SLEEPING BAG REPURPOSED INTO A COAT. EVERY RICK OWENS COLLECTION NORMALLY BEARS THE TITLE OF A PERSON (LARRY — AS IN LEGASPI — FALL 2019), THING (CYCLOPS, SPRING 2016) OR FEELING (VICIOUS, SPRING 2014). BUT MORE RECENTLY, HE’S STARTED NAMING THEM AFTER PLACES: LUXOR (FALL 2023) IN EGYPT, WHERE HE’S BEEN SPENDING PART OF THE WINTER, AND LIDO (SPRING 2024). “I’VE BEEN TRYING TO BE AS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AS I CAN,” HE SAYS. “AT MOST COMPANIES, IT’S A COMMITTEE DECISION. I WAS ALWAYS AN ONLY CHILD WHO PLAYED BY MYSELF.” THE NEW ONE IS CALLED PORTERVILLE. AMONG THE DESIGNS HE’S PREPARING FOR THE MEN’S SHOW (WHICH WAS INDEED HELD AT HIS HOUSE LAST MONTH, ALBEIT WITHOUT THE MIRRORED WALLS OR INDOOR ROCK GARDEN), THERE’S A RIBBED BALACLAVA AND A FURRY FLIGHT SUIT INSPIRED BY THE ANGULAR LINES OF BAUHAUS. AFTER TWO DECADES IN FRANCE, HE’S DECIDED TO GO HOME, IF ONLY SYMBOLICALLY. “I DON’T HAVE LOVE FOR PORTERVILLE. AND IF I’D STAYED, I’D HAVE BECOME AN ALCOHOLIC DENTIST,” HE SAYS. “BUT LIFE IS KIND OF DUMB. IT’S JUST PAIN, DEATH AND SICKNESS. I ACCEPT IT. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IT FORMED ME; IT GAVE ME THIS FIRE.” UNTIL HIS MOTHER STARTED CHEMOTHERAPY, HE HADN’T BEEN BACK TO HIS HOMETOWN IN 27 YEARS. OWENS PLANS TO SELL THE PROPERTY HE BOUGHT FOR HER; WITHOUT HER HUSBAND’S KNOWLEDGE, SHE HAD ANOTHER HOUSE IN TOWN THAT SHE DECORATED WITH FRILLY DOILIES AND CURTAINS WITH SWAGS — THE OPPOSITE OF THEIR FAMILY HOME, WHICH OWENS SAYS WAS CLUTTERED WITH HIS FATHER’S GUN COLLECTION. HIS DESIGNS OFFER A SIMILAR FREEDOM. “THE WORLD IS A THREATENING PLACE,” HE SAYS. “FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO YOUR BEST WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT’S HAPPENING IS THE OVERALL THEME OF THE CLOTHES.” OWENS JUMPS TO HIS FEET. “IT’S TIME TO EAT!” HE SAYS. WE DESCEND TO THE FIRST-FLOOR DINING ROOM, WHERE HANNAH ROSE DALTON AND STEVEN RAJ BHASKARAN, A MONTREAL-BASED FASHION AND MUSIC DUO WHO CALL THEMSELVES FECAL MATTER — THEIR SHAVED HEADS AND THE BLACK MASCARA SMEARED ACROSS THEIR WHITE-PAINTED FACES GIVING THEM THE APPEARANCE OF SATANISTS DABBLING IN KABUKI — HAVE BEEN REMINISCING WITH LAMY ABOUT A RECENT TRIP TO TOKYO FOR THE LAUNCH OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER DANIELLE LEVITT’S MONOGRAPH “MORE RICK OWENS.” FECAL MATTER D.J.ED THE PARTY; LAMY RODE IN ON A WHITE HORSE. “IT WAS OUR VERSION OF STUDIO 54,” SAYS OWENS. “SHE’S OUR BIANCA [JAGGER].” PIXIE, LAMY AND OWENS’S HAIRLESS SPHYNX CAT, SLINKS ACROSS THE BLACK PLYWOOD DINING TABLE HUNTING FOR FOOD. BEHIND THEM IS A MURAL PAINTED BY LAMY’S DAUGHTER, A CEMETERY SCENE WITH A MINOTAUR-LIKE CREATURE AND TOPLESS WOMEN DANCING IN NIQABS. ELSEWHERE, THERE’S A LIFELESS SUIT SCULPTURE — A METAPHOR FOR LOSS — BY ANSELM KIEFER, A WATERCOLOR OF A VAGINA BY CAROL RAMA AND A UTERUS-SHAPED DOG BY MARK LECKEY. “RICK CAN’T STAND IT,” SAYS LAMY. “HE SAYS, ‘YOU DO THIS JUST TO PISS ME OFF.’” ACROSS THE TABLE, OWENS LOOKS CONTENT. WHILE LAMY, AN AVID BOXER, COMPLAINS TO BHASKARAN ABOUT HAVING HER DRESSING ROOM ON THE FIFTH FLOOR — EVEN IF IT WAS HER IDEA TO REPLACE THE ELEVATOR WITH STAIRS — HE TELLS DALTON ABOUT HIS MEXICAN TRIP, WHICH INCLUDED A VISIT TO THE PINK-WALLED CASA BARRAGÁN, BY THE ARCHITECT LUIS BARRAGÁN. OVERHEARING THIS, LAMY SAYS SHE’S ALREADY BEEN THERE AND REDIRECTS THE CONVERSATION. “MY TRAINER TOLD ME, ‘YOUR STAIRS SAVE YOUR LIFE,’” SHE TELLS THE GROUP, LIGHTING ONE CIGARETTE OFF ANOTHER. “IT’S ALL THE CARDIO I NEED.” OWENS, WHO EXERCISES DAILY AT A HOTEL GYM, FOLLOWS A MORE TRADITIONAL FITNESS REGIMEN. “NOW IT’S KIND OF MAINTENANCE, LIKE BRUSHING MY TEETH,” HE SAYS. “I PROBABLY DON’T PUSH MYSELF AS MUCH AS I USED TO.” LAMY FLEXES HER BICEPS. “I DO,” SHE SAYS. OWENS LAUGHS AND KISSES HER ON THE FOREHEAD. IT’S THE NIGHT BEFORE THANKSGIVING AND, AS THE EVENING WINDS DOWN, BHASKARAN AND DALTON SHOW ME PHOTOS OF THEIR OWN HAIRLESS CAT, WHOSE NAME IS LEWDER THAN PIXIE’S, ON A PHONE. WHILE SCROLLING PAST AN INSTAGRAM PICTURE OF DALTON IN A STRAITJACKET, I NOTICE ANOTHER IMAGE, FROM 2022, IN WHICH THE TWO OF THEM ARE STANDING IN FRONT OF A BLACK CHRISTMAS TREE IN THIS VERY SPACE. THE CAPTION READS: “CAN’T BE WITH OUR BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES THIS YEAR, BUT THE MOST LOVING AND GENEROUS MICHÈLE + RICK GAVE US A WARM AND JOLLY CHRISTMAS TODAY. … WITHOUT OUR CHOSEN FAMILIES, SO MANY OF US WOULD BE LOST.” THE ABUNDANCE OF NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON THIS POST — “YUCK”; “DON’T INSULT JESUS” — ARE REMINDERS OF SOMETHING OWENS HAD TOLD ME EARLIER IN THE DAY. “JUDGMENTAL CONSERVATISM IS NEVER GOING AWAY,” HE SAID, REFERRING TO HIS FATHER AND TO EVERY OTHER CRITIC, LOVING OR CRUEL OR BOTH, WHO HELPED MAKE HIM WHO HE IS. “THE WORLD IS UGLY AND GLORIOUS AT THE SAME TIME. MY ROLE IS TO KEEP SOME KIND OF BALANCE.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

BUT IT IS REALLY FUN SEEING IT IN REAL LIFE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE IN JAPAN? 20 YEARS AGO. I’M NOT A FAN OF TRAVELLING. I JUST DON’T LIKE LONG FLIGHTS. I CAN’T SMOKE ON LONG FLIGHTS. I DON’T LIKE DRIVING IN CARS AND TRAVELLING AROUND. I AM NOT THAT ADVENTUROUS. ACTUALLY, I’M QUITE LAZY. I TELL MYSELF, ‘YOU’RE SUCH A LAZY DICK’. THEN AGAIN, I MADE IT TO PARIS, I HAVE MADE IT TO JAPAN, I’VE GOTTEN OUT OF THE HOUSE SO MAYBE I CAN GIVE MYSELF A BREAK. WHAT’S YOUR DAILY ROUTINE? I AM A CREATURE OF HABIT, AND THAT IS WHY BEING A DESIGNER SUITS ME. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BRISTLE AT HAVING TO STICK TO SUCH A ROUTINE, BUT I EMBRACE IT. HAVING TO COME UP WITH COLLECTIONS, ON TIME, FOUR TIMES A YEAR, IT GIVES ME A RHYTHM AND A HAPPY LITTLE SENSE OF PURPOSE. I PROBABLY CLING TO THAT. THE PACE ISN&#39;T A PROBLEM FOR ME. I CAN UNDERSTAND FOR OTHER DESIGNERS THE PACE AND THE PRESSURE COULD BE UNBEARABLE. IF I IMAGINE HAVING TO DEAL WITH COMMITTEE DECISIONS, ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS ALL THE TIME, I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY KILL ME. IT&#39;S NOT THAT I DON&#39;T FEEL ANY PRESSURE, BUT IT&#39;S NOT OPPRESSIVE. IT&#39;S INVIGORATING AND INSPIRING. IF I HAD UNLIMITED TIME AND RESOURCES, I WOULDN&#39;T KNOW WHERE TO START. BUT IF IT&#39;S SEASON TO SEASON, IN THOSE THREE MONTHS YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RESOURCES, AND YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING CONVINCING. THAT&#39;S A PUZZLE THAT I REALLY ENJOY CRACKING EVERY SEASON. I START EARLY ENOUGH SO THAT I’M NOT GOING TO END UP PANICKING. I&#39;VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 20 YEARS. AT THE BEGINNING I WOULD PUT THINGS OFF OR I WOULDN&#39;T DECIDE UNTIL TOO LATE. I&#39;M NOT REALLY THE TYPE TO MAKE LAST MINUTE SPONTANEOUS DECISIONS. WHEN I MAKE A DECISION, I STICK TO IT. AS FAR AS A DAILY ROUTINE, I GET UP AROUND EIGHT, I HAVE COFFEE, I LOOK AT MY EMAILS, AND I USUALLY TURN ON AN OLD AND BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE. IT&#39;S USUALLY THE SAME ONE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS MAYBE, IT HAS BEEN THE BLACK CAT FROM 1934. IT’S GOT BORIS KARLOFF AND THE DRACULA GUY, BELLA LUGOSI. IT IS ABOUT A YOUNG AMERICAN COUPLE STRANDED SOMEWHERE. THEIR CAR BREAKS DOWN, SO THEY HAVE TO STOP AT THIS CASTLE. THE OWNER IS AN ARCHITECT, AND THE CASTLE IS VERY MODERNIST. THE DECORATION IS SO JEAN PROUVÉ. IT MUST HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE ART FAIR IN PARIS WHERE ART DECO WAS INTRODUCED. IT&#39;S VERY FUTURISTIC AND MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SHOCKING IN THE 1930S. THE OWNER KEEPS THE BODIES OF HIS PAST LOVERS IN THESE GLASS CASKETS IN THE BASEMENT. HE IS GOING TO HAVE A SATANIC MASS AND HE WANTS TO USE THE YOUNG BRIDE AS A SACRIFICE. IN THE END THEY ESCAPE, AND THE CASTLE BLOWS UP. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I LOVE THAT MOVIE IS, IT&#39;S BLACK AND WHITE AND HAS THIS ART DECO AESTHETIC. IT IS WHAT THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW WAS BASED ON, THE STORY IS IDENTICAL. THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW WAS A HUGE INFLUENCE ON ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG. THE OTHER DAY I WAS LOOKING AT THE CROWD AT MY SHOW AND I WAS THINKING, ‘GOD I RECREATED THAT ROCKY HORROR PARTY SCENE’. AT THE TIME THAT MOVIE WAS THE MOST GLAMOROUS, EXOTIC THING I COULD IMAGINE. A REMOTE PARTY IN A RUINED OLD CASTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN EUROPE, WITH ALL THESE FREAKS TURNING UP ON MOTORCYCLES. THERE WAS THIS SEXUAL AMBIGUITY, FREEDOM AND RELEASE. SO, BACK TO MY ROUTINE. I WATCH MY LITTLE MOVIE WHILE I&#39;M TAKING A SHOWER AND GO DOWNSTAIRS TO MY OFFICE. I’LL HAVE SOME MEETINGS WITH SOME OF MY TEAM AND THEN GO OUT ON THE TERRACE AND SIT UNDER THE TREES TO WORK FOR A WHILE. I MIGHT GO OUT TO LUNCH WITH FRIENDS. AFTER LUNCH I GO UPSTAIRS TAKE A LITTLE NAP AND I START THE WHOLE THING OVER. I GO TO THE GYM AROUND 8 O &#39;CLOCK AT A HOTEL DOWN THE STREET. I DON&#39;T HAVE A GYM AT HOME BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE. I ALWAYS HAVE TO GO FIND A GYM SOMEWHERE. I CHANGE GYMS MAYBE EVERY FIVE YEARS. CHANGING GYMS IS LIKE MOVING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. IT&#39;S TOTALLY DISRUPTIVE BECAUSE IT BECOMES SUCH A HUGE PART OF YOUR DAY. IT&#39;S VERY SIGNIFICANT. RECENTLY I STARTED GOING TO THE GYM AT THIS WEIRD LITTLE HOTEL THAT HAS BEEN OPEN FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS. IT’S KIND OF ISOLATED AND DISCREET. NOBODY USES IT. IN THE BASEMENT, THERE&#39;S A POOL. IT&#39;S VERY PLUSH. MICHELLE USUALLY COMES AND MEETS ME AROUND 21:00 OR 21:30. WE HAVE DINNER IN THIS LITTLE BAR IN THE HOTEL, IN THE CORNER. I APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE IT&#39;S GOT MOHAIR, VELVET, BANQUETS, AND REALLY GOOD PORTO LINEN. BUT THEN SOME OF THE WALLS ARE COVERED IN STYROFOAM, NOT PLASTER AND THAT DISTURBS ME. SO, I CAN&#39;T BE COMPLETELY AT PEACE, BUT THAT’S AS CLOSE TO PEACE AS I EVER REALLY GET. EVERY SINGLE DAY IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE THAT. UNLESS I HAVE TO TRAVEL. WHAT DEFINES YOU AS A DESIGNER AND WHAT MAKES YOUR APPROACH SO UNIQUE? I LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS COLLECTION AND SEE WHAT THE LOGICAL PROGRESSION WOULD BE. WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE AFTER THE SHOW OR AFTER THE COLLECTION I JUST DID. THERE MUST BE LOGIC AND CONSISTENCY TO IT. I THINK I DO COLLABS AS A WAY OF PROMOTING MY ETHOS WHICH IS ANTI-BIGOTRY. WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I REALLY RESENTED RULES BECAUSE I WAS A FLAMBOYANT SISSY IN A SMALL TOWN. THE REACTION TO ME WAS HOSTILE. I&#39;VE PROBABLY BEEN SEEKING VENGEANCE FOR THAT MY ENTIRE LIFE. IT&#39;S NOT EXACTLY VENGEANCE THOUGH. IT&#39;S TOLERANCE. IN THE KMART BASEMENT I FOUND DAVID BOWIE&#39;S DIAMOND DOG ALBUM COVER. IT DISTURBED ME SO MUCH AND MADE ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE IT WAS PUSHING ALL THESE BUTTONS THAT I DIDN&#39;T KNOW WERE THERE. THAT KIND OF GROTESQUE, GLAM, SEXUAL AMBIGUITY, THAT SET ME OFF ON MY PATH AND THAT WAS MY RELEASE. I THINK IT WAS A REACTION TO THE AESTHETICS AROUND ME, TO THE SMALL CONSERVATIVE TOWN WHICH WAS RATHER SMUG AND BIGOTED. I REALISED WE HAVE TO HAVE EXTREMES TO KEEP THE BALANCE. SO, THAT&#39;S WHAT I DECIDED TO DO. I DECIDED TO BE KIND OF A PRIEST OF MY KIND OF AESTHETIC. AN ALTERNATIVE AESTHETIC THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THEIR OWN REFLECTION IN IF THEY CAN&#39;T FIND THEIR REFLECTION IN THE STANDARD, CONTEMPORARY, RIGID, AND THE CLICHED. WHEN I DO COLLABS, I AM ABLE TO TALK TO A NEW AUDIENCE ABOUT THAT BOTH IN SUBTLE AND UNSUBTLE WAYS. I&#39;M NOT SAYING THAT I&#39;M SAVING THE WORLD AT ALL. I&#39;M JUST SAYING THAT I&#39;M HELPING THE BALANCE A LITTLE BIT IN MY OWN TINY LITTLE WAY. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT. THAT MAKES SENSE. WHAT&#39;S THE SECRET TO LONGEVITY? TENACITY. KEEPING YOUR HEAD DOWN AND HAVING FANTASTIC PARTNERS. THAT IS THE PART OF THIS STORY THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST MAGICAL BECAUSE WITHOUT HAVING PARTNERS THAT PROTECT YOU, IT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE. YOU NEED PARTNERS WHO KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THE INDUSTRY. THAT&#39;S NOT A TALENT THAT I HAVE. SO, ON MY OWN, I WOULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT. I ALWAYS JOKE THAT I THINK MY PARTNERS COULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH ANYONE, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH IDEAS AND THERE&#39;S A LOT OF CREATIVITY OUT THERE, BUT IT&#39;S THE EXECUTION THAT REALLY COUNTS. IDEAS ARE A DIME A DOZEN BUT BEING ABLE TO GET THEM EXECUTED OUT THERE PROPERLY, THAT&#39;S THE HARD PART. SO, I DON&#39;T TAKE ALL THE CREDIT THAT’S FOR SURE. I HAVE GREAT PARTNERS WHO HAVE PROTECTED ME FOR THE PAST 27 YEARS. AND THAT IS A MARRIAGE THAT IS VERY UNUSUAL. TO BE THAT HARMONIOUS AND FOR THAT BOND TO BE SO STRONG. THAT IS EXTREMELY RARE. WE&#39;RE EXTREMELY LUCKY. THE AESTHETIC OF THE BRAND RICK OWENS HAS STAYED CONSISTENT OVER TIME. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE AESTHETIC AND KEEP IT TOGETHER? I MEAN, WHEN I LOOK AT THE ARTIST, I LOOK AT DONALD CHADD AND JOHN CHAMBERLAIN AND GUYS LIKE THAT. BEING ABLE TO SEE THAT KIND OF FOCUS AND THAT KIND OF STEADFASTNESS, IT&#39;S ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT TO ME. LE CORBUSIER, ROBERT MALLET-STEVENS, THOSE GUYS, THEY ALL HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC SENSE OF LOGIC THAT I ALWAYS KIND OF ADMIRED. I ALWAYS WANTED TO EMULATE THAT, AND I’VE DONE MY BEST. FINALLY, WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE? WHEN PEOPLE GET TIRED OF ME, I&#39;M NOT JUST GOING TO CHANGE. IT’S EITHER YOU LIKE MY STYLE, OR YOU DON&#39;T. I ALWAYS SAY, I DON&#39;T REALLY WANT TO GET BIGGER. I WANT TO GET BETTER. I HAVE MORE FIRE IN ME ABOUT GETTING BETTER THAN I EVER DID. I SEE THIS BODY OF WORK AND I LIKE IT. I THINK IT&#39;S WORTHWHILE AND I WANT TO PROTECT IT. I DON&#39;T WANT TO FUCK IT UP. I WANT IT TO BE PERFECT UNTIL THE VERY END. I&#39;M EXTREMELY MOTIVATED. MY JOB NOW IS TO PROTECT MY BODY OF WORK. I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THE LEGACY. I DON’T KNOW IF THAT IS SOMETHING I WANT TO CLING ONTO FOREVER. I HAVEN&#39;T FIGURED THAT OUT YET.

RICK OWENS IS ONE OF FASHION’S LAST TRUE ODDBALLS. IN HIS RUNWAY SHOWS, THE 62-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIA-BORN DESIGNER HAS FEATURED MODELS STRAPPED TO EACH OTHER LIKE BACKPACKS, STEP-TEAM PERFORMANCES AND AN ARSENAL OF FIREWORKS TO RIVAL ANY JULY 4 PARADE. ON THE BUSINESS SIDE, HE’S BUILT AN EMPIRE ON PUGNACIOUS CREATIONS LIKE LEATHER JACKETS WITH SPIKED SHOULDERS AND TOTTERING PLATFORM BOOTS. DESPITE SUCH CHALLENGING CLOTHES, THE CULT OF OWENS IS DEEP AND DIVERSE. NUMBERED AMONG HIS FANS ARE THE RAPPER YASIIN BEY, LEBRON JAMES AND TWITTER CO-FOUNDER JACK DORSEY, WHO HAS WALKED ACROSS TECH-CONFERENCE STAGES IN THE DESIGNER’S DROP-CROTCH TROUSERS AND BULBOUS SNEAKERS. “I APPRECIATE THE FREAKS,” SAYS OWENS. “I WANT TO BE SOMEBODY THAT SAYS YOU CAN INVENT YOURSELF, THAT YOU CAN RELEASE THE FREAK WITHIN.” CRUCIALLY, OWENS RETAINS CONTROL OF HIS BUSINESS, SWIMMING STRONGLY AGAINST THE CURRENT OF CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS SWEPT UP MANY LUXURY FASHION BRANDS. “I AM INDEPENDENT AND I CAN DO WHATEVER THE F—I WANT,” SAYS OWENS. HE SPLITS HIS TIME BETWEEN HIS FACTORY NEAR VENICE AND THE LEFT BANK PARISIAN HOME HE SHARES WITH HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY. THE DESIGNER HIMSELF COULD BE SEEN AS HIS OWN BEST BILLBOARD. BUILT LIKE A CROSSFIT TRAINER WITH LONG RAVEN LOCKS, HE FLOATS AROUND HIS OFFICE IN SLINKY BLACK SHIRTS AND DROOPING TROUSERS OF HIS OWN DESIGN. HERE, HE SPEAKS TO WSJ. ABOUT HIS WORKOUT ROUTINE, WHY HE NAPS EVERY DAY AND HOW HE FEELS ABOUT SEEING HIS DESIGNS GET KNOCKED OFF. WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING? I HAVE A DOUBLE ESPRESSO. I HAVE A MINIBAR IN THE DRESSING ROOM NEXT TO THE BEDROOM THAT HAS ALL THE STUFF THAT I NEED. I CONSIDERED PUTTING A TOASTER IN THERE, BUT I THOUGHT, OH, I CAN’T GET THAT DOMESTIC. WHAT’S NEXT? I GET BACK TO BED, AND I GO THROUGH NEW YORK AND FOREIGN EMAILS THAT HAVE ARRIVED OVERNIGHT. THEN I TURN ON THE TV, PUT ON A MOVIE AND LEAVE IT WITH THE SOUND OFF. I HAVE THAT MOVIE PLAYING CONTINUOUSLY WHILE I’M GETTING DRESSED. I HAVE AN EXPOSED SHOWER NEXT TO THE BED IN THE BEDROOM SO I CAN WATCH THE TV WHILE SHOWERING. WHAT MOVIE DO YOU HAVE ON ROTATION RIGHT NOW? THE BLACK CAT, FROM THE 1930S, STARRING BELA LUGOSI AND BORIS KARLOFF. IT’S BLACK-AND-WHITE, ART DECO. VISUALLY, IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME. YOU KEEP THE MOVIE ON MUTE, SO DO YOU LISTEN TO ANYTHING? I HAVE MUSIC ON, AND IT’S EITHER MONTSERRAT CABALLÉ [SINGING] A WAGNER OPERA, OR IT’S JULIE LONDON, BECAUSE JULIE LONDON HAS A VERY SOOTHING WAY ABOUT HER. AND THEN YOU GET TO WORK? I GET DRESSED IN MY DRESSING ROOM, AND THEN I GO DOWNSTAIRS TWO FLOORS TO MY OFFICE. I USUALLY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEONE FROM MY TEAM ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH FABRIC ORDERS. I’VE ALWAYS LIVED WHERE I’VE WORKED, THE WHOLE THING ALL BLENDS TOGETHER, I DON’T SEPARATE. WHAT DO YOU TEND TO EAT FOR LUNCH? AVOCADOS, EGGS AND TOAST MOST OF THE TIME. OR AVOCADO, SALMON AND TORTILLAS. I DON’T DRINK ENOUGH WATER. I KEEP THINKING I SHOULD DRINK WATER, I JUST NEVER DO. DO YOU GO OUT TO EAT? WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL, NICE, GREAT TERRACE, AND I’LL HAVE LUNCH ON IT IF IT’S A PRETTY DAY. WE LIVE BY THE MINISTRY OF THE DEFENSE, AND THEY HAVE A BIG GARDEN THAT ABUTS OUR TERRACE. SO IT’S LIKE BEING IN A FOREST. WE DON’T HAVE A LOT OF NEIGHBORS LOOKING INTO OUR TERRACE, SO IT FEELS VERY INSULATED, WHICH IS KIND OF MAGIC FOR THE MIDDLE OF PARIS. I’LL HAVE LUNCH THERE OUTSIDE UNDER THE TREE AFTER LUNCH, THEN WHAT? I WILL GO UPSTAIRS, DRAW THE CURTAINS, HAVE A COUPLE CIGARETTES WHILE I’M LOOKING THROUGH INSTAGRAM, LIKE, JUST RELAXING, AND THEN I’LL TAKE A NAP FOR AN HOUR IN MY DRESSING ROOM. A NAP IS A RETREAT AND IT’S A WAY TO GUARD MY ENERGY, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY A DAY AND I NEED IT PROTECTED. WHAT’S YOUR WORKOUT ROUTINE? I GO TO THE GYM AROUND EIGHT AT J.K. PLACE, THE HOTEL AROUND THE CORNER FROM ME. IT’S A VERY SMALL HOTEL, VERY DISCREET ON A SMALL SIDE STREET, AND IT’S NEVER REALLY CROWDED. I DO STOMACH EVERY DAY—YOU JUST HAVE TO DO SIT-UPS. I DO THE KIND WHERE I’M ON MY BUTT AND YOU LIFT YOUR LEGS AND YOU LIFT YOUR TORSO SO YOU’RE KIND OF SCISSORING. I’LL DO ABOUT 90 OF THOSE—NOT IN A ROW, LIKE 30, 30, 30. THEN I’LL DO MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS—120 OF THOSE. IT SOUNDS HARD TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT I ALWAYS SAY IT’S ONLY ONE DISCO SONG. YOU CAN GET ALL THIS STUFF DONE DURING “I FEEL LOVE,” BY DONNA SUMMER. HOW DO YOU LIKE TO SPEND YOUR DAYS OFF? THE BEST THING IS TO WALK FROM MY HOUSE, CROSS THE RIVER TO WALK THROUGH THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES, POP IN AT THE LOUVRE AND THEN COME HOME FOR A NAP. IT’S THE MOST CIVILIZED, GORGEOUS THING. LONG BLACK HAIR IS A RICK OWENS SIGNATURE. HOW DO YOU TREAT YOUR HAIR? I DYE IT MYSELF WITH BIGEN HAIR DYE, WHICH IS REALLY INEXPENSIVE AND GENERIC. I’VE BEEN DYEING MY HAIR WITH THAT EVER SINCE I WAS A GOTH ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. AND I DYE MY EYEBROWS, TOO, BECAUSE MY EYEBROWS AREN’T AS STRONG AS THEY USED TO BE. I ALSO GO EVERY THREE MONTHS TO A PLACE THAT CHEMICALLY STRAIGHTENS IT BECAUSE MY HAIR IS NATURALLY KIND OF CURLY. I DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY USE ON IT, I’M SURE IT’S NOT HELPING THE BALD SPOT AT ALL, BUT I’D RATHER HAVE THE CONVENIENCE. I CAN LIVE WITH A BALD SPOT. YOU’RE WELL KNOWN FOR WEARING YOUR OWN DESIGNS. WHAT’S SOMETHING YOU’VE BEEN WEARING A LOT OF? I WEAR PLATFORM BOOTS. PLATFORMS ARE KIND OF A PROTEST AGAINST CONSERVATIVE CLASSICAL BEAUTY. THEY ARE A FLAG FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AESTHETIC. I WEAR THEM WHEN I TRAVEL BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THAT GUY [IN PLATFORM BOOTS] WHEN I WAS 9, 10. DO YOU ENJOY TRAVELING FOR YOUR JOB? I DON’T TRAVEL SO MUCH, BECAUSE WHEREVER I’M GOING TO GO RARELY IS WORTH THE ENERGY AND THE DISAPPOINTING AESTHETICS YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF THROUGH TO GET THERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE ON THE STREET WEARING YOUR CLOTHES? IT’S ALWAYS A DELIGHT, BUT IT’S ALMOST MORE OF A DELIGHT WHEN I SEE KNOCKOFFS. I WAS ON A METRO IN ITALY YEARS AGO, AND THERE WAS SOMEBODY WEARING A CHEAP KNOCKOFF OF ONE OF MY JACKETS. I COULDN’T HAVE BEEN MORE THRILLED. I WAS THINKING MY AESTHETIC PENETRATED THE CULTURE SO MUCH THAT IT MADE ITS WAY TO A CHEAP KNOCKOFF. WHAT’S THE BEST ADVICE YOU’VE RECEIVED? AT SOME POINT WHERE I WAS FRUSTRATED AS A TEENAGER, MY DAD KIND OF SARCASTICALLY SAID, “YOU KNOW, RICK, LIFE ISN’T FAIR.” THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME FOREVER. 5 MORNING MUST-HAVES BYREDO LIP BALM “I LOVE THE WAY THE BOTTLE WORKS. I HAVE THIS IN MY POCKET ALL DAY LONG.” BEVERLEY NICHOLS BOOKS “HE HAS THESE REALLY GIDDY, SILLY OBSERVATIONS THAT ARE LAUGH-OUT-LOUD FUNNY FOR ME.” EASTER LILIES “IT’S A SWEETER, LESS VOLUPTUOUS SMELL.” VIENNESE SACHER CUBES “YOU GET A HIGHER RATIO OF ICING PER CAKE, VERY IMPORTANT.” FEVER-TREE GINGER BEER “THEY ALWAYS HAVE IT IN BARS.

THE SHOW, ORGANIZED BY HENDRIK FOLKERTS, THE MUSEUM’S CURATOR OF INTERNATIONAL CONTEMPORARY ART AND HEAD OF EXHIBITIONS, WILL UNFOLD ACROSS FIVE OTHER VENUES WITHIN THE CITY: ACCELERATOR, STOCKHOLM UNIVERSITY; INDEX–SWEDISH FOUNDATION FOR CONTEMPORARY ART; MODERNA DANSTEATERN (MDT); NATIONALMUSEUM; AND TENSTA KONSTHALL. THE PRESENTATION WILL HIGHLIGHT THE ARTIST’S WORK IN VIDEO, MUSIC, PERFORMANCE, PUBLISHING, PAINTING, SCULPTURE, PHOTOGRAPHY, COLLAGE, AND INSTALLATION. DAVIS AND OWENS, WHO HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS, DISCUSS ART, FAGGOTRY, SEX, AMBITION, AND LOS ANGELES, WHERE THE FORMER (NOW BASED IN BERLIN) AND THE LATTER (WHO CURRENTLY RESIDES IN PARIS) SPENT THEIR EARLY DAYS. —ALEX JOVANOVICH RICK OWENS: DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE MET? VAGINAL DAVIS: OH, YES, I DO. YOU WERE DOING WORK WITH THIS BAND CALLED, I THINK, RED WEDDING? DO YOU REMEMBER THEM? RO: I DO. VD: I FORGOT EXACTLY IF YOU WERE MAKING COSTUMES FOR THEM OR DESIGNING SOMETHING FOR THEIR STAGE SHOWS. RO: I WASN’T. I WAS FUCKING THE SINGER. VD: HA! THAT’S HOW WE FIRST MET, THROUGH RED WEDDING. I THINK IT WAS AT ONE OF THEIR SHOWS, AND I WAS WEARING AN OUTFIT WHERE I WAS SORT OF COPYING ONE OF MY MOTHER’S LOOKS. SHE WAS DOING UNDERWEAR AS OUTERWEAR WAY BEFORE JEAN-PAUL GAULTIER. RO: THAT’S SO FUNNY. I DON’T REMEMBER THAT AT ALL. VD:WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER, SWEETIE? RO: I REMEMBER [PHOTOGRAPHER] RICK CASTRO SAYING, “LET’S GO TO THE MOVIES, WE’RE GOING TO TAKE VAGINAL DAVIS WITH US,” AND ALL THREE OF US WENT TO THE BEVERLY CENTER [IN LOS ANGELES]. I CAN’T REMEMBER WHAT WE SAW, BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HUNG OUT. BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, AT SOME POINT, YOU TRANSFORMED: YOU BECAME SCARY AND AGGRESSIVE WITH ME, JUST TO SHOW ME HOW YOU COULD CHANGE AND BECOME ANOTHER PERSONALITY. YOU ACTUALLY WERE REALLY SCARY, BECAUSE YOU’RE SO BIG. YOU WERE PLAYING, OF COURSE, BUT YOU WERE STILL SCARY. VD: WELL, I AM A GHETTO GIRL. RO: YEAH, I KNOW. BUT I REMEMBER SAYING TO MYSELF, “WOW, THAT’S CONVINCING. . . .” VD: I WAS PROBABLY GOING INTO ONE OF MY OTHER IDENTITIES: BUSTER BEAUTÉ, MY DRAG KING PERSONA. RO: IT WAS SUPER-BUTCH AND SUPER-SCARY. VD: THAT CHARACTER IS THE ONE I WAS CHANNELING WHEN I DID THE [1996 BRUCE LABRUCE] MOVIE HUSTLER WHITE. RO: YEAH. I REMEMBER SOMEONE USING WHITE-BREAD WRAPPING FOR A CONDOM IN THAT MOVIE. IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED? VD: YES. WONDER BREAD. RO: SO THIS EXHIBITION OF YOURS, WOULD YOU CALL IT A RETROSPECTIVE? VD: OH, IS IT A RETRO-SPECTACLE? WELL, THE CURATOR, HENDRIK [FOLKERTS], HE WANTED TO DO SORT OF WHAT THEY CALL A SURVEY. I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THAT TERM, SURVEY. I’M ANCIENT, OF COURSE, BUT NOT ANCIENT ENOUGH FOR A SURVEY. AND IT WOULD’VE BEEN TOO DIFFICULT TO DO A PROPER ONE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, SO I GUESS THE SHOW’S A REVISIT OF THINGS. RO: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE SHOWING? VD: THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE EXHIBITION IS AT THE MODERNA MUSEET. ONE OF THE THINGS I’LL BE DOING THERE IS RE-CREATING A VERSION OF THE PACIFIC CINERAMA DOME [IN LA]. IT’S GOING TO BE A MULTIPLEX WITH SOME OF MY FILMS PLAYING. I’M DEDICATING IT TO MY LESBIAN COUSIN KARLA DUPLANTIER, WHO RECENTLY DIED. SHE WAS THE DRUMMER FOR THE CONTROLLERS, A PUNK BAND. I’M ALSO GOING TO RE-CREATE MY APARTMENT GALLERY, HAG. DO YOU REMEMBER HAG? RO: I TOTALLY DO. YEAH. VD: AT 7850 SUNSET BOULEVARD, LA VILLA ROSA. YOU WERE AT THE FIRST OPENING. YOU EVEN SHOWED WORK THERE. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? RO: I DON’T. WHAT DID I SHOW? VD: YOU MADE THESE PAINTINGS THAT WERE BEAUTIFUL. THEY SOLD, TOO. I WAS ALWAYS SHOCKED WHEN THINGS SOLD, BECAUSE I’M NOT A GALLERIST. RO: I DON’T THINK I EVER GOT PAID. VD: I DID PAY YOU! YOU DIDN’T GET VERY MUCH, BUT YEAH, YOU GOT PAID. ALICE BAG HAD A SHOW THERE. AS DID GORILLA ROSE, WHO WORKED AT THE SOAP PLANT [NOW SOAP PLANT/WACKO]. CHARLES LEDRAY, WHO’S A HUGE ARTIST NOW, HE HAD AN EXHIBITION THERE TOO. AS DID MARI KONO. OH, AND THE FIRST SHOW WAS WITH DREW BARRYMORE’S FATHER, JOHN DREW BARRYMORE. HE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO ME WITH ALL THESE TIRED DEATH ROCKERS. HE MADE THESE ASSEMBLAGES FROM HYPODERMIC NEEDLES AND DEAD ROACHES. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? RO: YEAH, I DO REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. VD: OH MY GOD. MY OPENINGS AT HAG WERE INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SMALL SPACE. YOU COULDN’T HAVE AN ATTITUDE. YOU HAD TO BE FRIENDLY. PEOPLE ALWAYS MET THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS—BOYFRIENDS, GIRLFRIENDS, WHATEVER—THERE. THEN I HAD THESE AMAZING PARTIES AT HAG, AND I GOT ALL THIS GREAT PRESS BECAUSE BACK IN THOSE DAYS, PEOPLE DIDN’T HAVE HOME GALLERIES. THAT BECAME A TREND IN THE EARLY ’90S, BUT AT THAT TIME, IN THE ’80S, PEOPLE WEREN’T DOING IT, SO IT BECAME KIND OF A THING. RO: YOU’VE DONE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN YOUR LIFE. WHENEVER I GET ASKED TO DO A PROJECT, I ALWAYS THINK OF IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE MY VALUES: A REJECTION OF THE OPPRESSIVE INTOLERANCE THAT I EXPERIENCED GROWING UP. I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS A LOT RECENTLY: HOW DO I SUMMARIZE WHAT IT IS THAT I WANT TO PROMOTE, WHENEVER I’M GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY? HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? ABOUT SUMMARIZING WHAT YOU DO? BECAUSE IT’S NOT VERY FLATTERING, BUT WE ALL DO IT, SO I KIND OF SUMMARIZED MYSELF BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE COULD. HOW WOULD YOU SUMMARIZE YOURSELF? VD: THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT, BECAUSE I DON’T REALLY BELIEVE IN THE SOUND BITE. FOR ALL THESE MANY CENTURIES THAT I’VE LIVED ON THE PLANET, I REALLY HAVE DONE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING. I GUESS I’VE JUST TAKEN MY FORM OF ILLNESS—AND IT DEFINITELY IS AN ILLNESS—AND TURNED IT INTO SOMETHING. I THINK THAT’S THE ONLY WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. I’VE ALWAYS BEEN A SICK TICKET, AND I DESCEND FROM A LONG LINE OF SICK TICKETS. AND WITCHES, AND VOODOO-HOODOO SWAMP WOMEN. MY MOTHER’S FROM LOUISIANA. SHE’S BLACK CREOLE. HER NAME WAS MARY MAGDALENE—THAT TELLS YOU A LOT RIGHT THERE. AND HER MOTHER, MAMA SARAH, WAS BORN ON A CHOCTAW INDIAN RESERVATION. I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF THESE WITCHY-POOS, SO EVERYTHING THAT I’VE DONE IS ALWAYS FILTERED THROUGH THIS ILLNESS, BEING KIND OF OUT THERE IN A PARTICULAR WAY. I’M NOT TRYING TO BE PROVOCATIVE OR ANYTHING. PEOPLE THINK THAT I’M TRYING TO BE, BUT I’M NOT. IT’S JUST THAT EVERYONE ELSE TAKES IT AS A PROVOCATION. YOU’RE CONSISTENT, TOO, WITH ALL YOUR SEASONS OF WORK. RO: BUT I DO KNOW WHEN I’M BEING PROVOCATIVE, AND I RELISH IT. I FEEL THAT I NEED TO BE SHOCKING, AND I NEED TO BE TRANSGRESSIVE, AND I NEED TO PROMOTE PERVERSITY. YOU DO TOO. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU’RE PUSHING BUTTONS, AND YOU DO IT DELIBERATELY. I KNOW THAT YOU MUST, BECAUSE YOU’RE A SMART GRANNY. WHEN YOU CALL YOURSELF “ILL,” YOU MEAN TWISTED. YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE IN HOW YOU INTERPRET THE WORLD. IT’S DONE IN A VERY PERSONAL WAY THAT IS FUNNY AND LOUD AND POIGNANT, AND I THINK THAT’S WHAT YOU DO. THAT’S MY SOUND BITE FOR YOU. VD: WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT, DARLING. RO: YOU’RE A FILTER. YOU’RE KIND OF A FASCINATING FILTER. VD: A LOT OF IT COMES JUST THROUGH OSMOSIS. IT’S DONE VERY ORGANICALLY. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT EVERYTHING I DO IS SPONTANEOUS, BUT THAT’S NOT REALLY THE CASE. BUT WHEN YOU’VE BEEN ALIVE AS LONG AS WE HAVE, YOU GAIN A LOT OF REFERENCES TO THINGS. RO: NOT A LOT OF US. YOU’RE A REALLY LITERATE PERSON. YOU HAVE AMAZING REFERENCES. YOU’VE STUDIED, YOU’VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH. VD: I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME WHO HAD GONE ON TO UNIVERSITY. AND I WAS LUCKY, BECAUSE I CAME ABOUT AT A TIME WHEN THERE WAS A SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS. THERE WERE A LOT OF PROGRAMS THROUGH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED PEOPLE. BOTH ME AND RON [ATHEY] WERE PART OF THE MGM PROGRAM, THE MENTALLY GIFTED MINORS PROGRAM, IN THE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. RO: I FORGOT ABOUT THAT. VD: YOU DIDN’T HAVE THAT, BECAUSE PORTERVILLE, WHERE YOU GREW UP, IS IN THE MID-PART OF CALIFORNIA, SO YOU’RE A DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT ME AND RON, WE BOTH GREW UP IN THE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, HIM IN POMONA AND ME IN MID-CITY LOS ANGELES, AND THERE WERE ALL THESE PROGRAMS. I GOT TESTED WHEN I WAS, I GUESS, IN THE FIRST GRADE, BECAUSE I COULD ALREADY READ BEFORE I STARTED SCHOOL. I WAS JUST SO HUNGRY FOR KNOWLEDGE. I USED TO DRIVE MY POOR OLDER SISTERS CRAZY BECAUSE THEY COULDN’T READ ENOUGH BOOKS TO ME. THEY WERE SICK OF IT, SO THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO READ. BACK THEN, THERE WAS A GENUINE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS, WHEN LIBERALS WERE REAL LIBERALS. THEY TRULY FELT LIKE GIVING BACK, INSTEAD OF ONLY GIVING THROUGH PHILANTHROPY JUST TO GET THEIR NAME ON A BUILDING. THINGS REALLY MEANT MORE BACK IN THE ’60S AND ’70S, THE SPIRIT OF ’68—I BENEFITED FROM ALL THAT. I FEEL SORRY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST NO JOBS FOR THEM. THE WHOLE CLIMATE IS FALLING APART, AND THE ONLY THING FOR THEM TO DO NOW IS TO BASICALLY BECOME COURTESANS THROUGH ONLYFANS AND WHATNOT. THAT’S THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE NOW. IF THEY’RE EVEN REASONABLY ATTRACTIVE AND HAVE MUSCULATURE AND LARGE GENITALIA, THEY CAN USE THAT TO HAVE THIS CAREER AND GET MORE OF THE MONEYS TO FLOW DIRECTLY TO THEM INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE MIDDLEMEN. I SUPPORT THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THAT. I’VE HAD A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO’VE BEEN DOING THAT. THEY’RE MODERN-DAY COURTESANS, LIKE GRETA GARBO AS CAMILLE. WE WERE THE LAST GENERATION THAT HAD CHOICES, AND I WAS ABLE TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES. I WAS THE FIRST ONE IN MY FAMILY TO DO SO. I HAVE A GREAT-NEPHEW AND A GREAT-NIECE: ONE WENT TO UNIVERSITY AND BECAME A MUSICOLOGIST, WHILE THE OTHER BECAME A CHEMICAL ENGINEER. AFTER I WENT TO UCLA I WORKED THERE. REMEMBER WHEN UCLA WAS MY DAY JOB, SWEETIE? RO: TOTALLY. VD: AT UCLA’S PLACEMENT AND CAREER PLANNING CENTER. THAT’S HOW I WAS ABLE TO DO MY CRAZY ZINE, FERTILE LATOYAH JACKSON, BECAUSE I HAD ACCESS TO A XEROX. THAT WAS MY GRANT—MY DAY JOB I TREATED LIKE RECEIVING A GRANT, AND I HAD THAT XEROX MACHINE TO MAKE MY OWN CRAZY MAGAZINE, WHICH OF COURSE YOU AND MICHELE [LAMY, OWENS’S LIFE PARTNER] WERE IN, AND SO MANY OTHERS. IT’S FUNNY THAT PEOPLE ARE NOW INTERESTED IN THE ’80S WITH THE QUEER ZINE EXPLOSION AND WHATNOT, BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS ZINE SHOW AT THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM RECENTLY. MORE THAN FORTY YEARS HAVE PASSED, AND PEOPLE STILL HAVE AN INTEREST IN SOMETHING THAT WAS COPIED AND STAPLED BY HAND. IT’S INSANE. RO: THOSE THINGS EVENTUALLY COME TO THE FOREFRONT, THE THINGS THAT WERE KIND OF SIGNIFICANT AND REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE. I MEAN, THEY BECOME MORE OBVIOUS FORTY YEARS LATER WHEN YOU COMPARE THEM WITH EVERYTHING THAT’S BEEN DONE SINCE THEN. VD: WHO KNEW? WHO WOULD HAVE THUNK THAT SOMEONE LIKE ME WOULD BE HAVING A SOLO SHOW AT A VERY PROMINENT MUSEUM? IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THAT HAPPENING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO, I WOULD’VE LAUGHED IN THEIR FACE. I DIDN’T EVEN HAVE GALLERY REPRESENTATION UNTIL ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. MY FIRST GALLERY WAS IN NEW YORK WITH INVISIBLE-EXPORTS—WHICH HAS TURNED INTO NEW DISCRETIONS, RUN BY BENJAMIN TISCHER—AND THEN, ON THE WEST COAST, WITH AMY ADAMS OF ADAMS AND OLLMAN. NOW I HAVE ISABELLA BORTOLOZZI HERE IN BERLIN, WHERE I LIVE. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY COMMERCIAL ART GALLERIES OR THAT PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY BUY MY INSANE MAKEUP PAINTINGS, MY INSTALLATIONS, MY CRAZY VIDEOS, AND ALL THAT STUFF. I COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THAT HAPPENING, BECAUSE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS DON’T HAPPEN TO PEOPLE FROM MY CLASS. IT’S REALLY VERY SURPRISING. EVERY DAY, I’VE JUST BEEN SORT OF PINCHING MYSELF: “IS THIS REAL?” RO: IT’S NOT SURPRISING. VD: I’VE ACTUALLY FOUND A LITTLE BIT OF LOVEY-DOVEY IN MY LIFE, TOO—SOMEONE’S ACTUALLY SHOWN INTEREST IN ME. THAT’S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, EITHER. RO: IT’S NOT SURPRISING THAT YOU GOT ATTENTION, BECAUSE YOU WERE SO PROLIFIC. YOU WORKED AND WORKED AND WORKED AND PRODUCED AND PRODUCED AND PRODUCED. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO JUST HAVE FIRE IN THEIR BELLIES. THAT WAS THE SAME WITH ME. I WAS GOING TO MAKE STUFF NO MATTER WHAT, AND YOU WERE THE SAME. VD: YOU DID. THERE’S NO ONE MORE PROLIFIC THAN YOU. YOU WERE ALWAYS, ALWAYS WORKING. RO: WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT YOU’RE MORE PROLIFIC THAN I AM. I MEAN, YOU, SINCE THOSE DAYS, YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT YOU ARE. YOU WERE A POWERFUL CREATIVE FORCE, BECAUSE YOU JUST DID NOT STOP, AND YOU WOULD NOT SHUT THE FUCK UP. I MEAN, YOU WOULD NOT BE IGNORED, SO THAT’S WHY YOU’RE GETTING A MUSEUM SHOW, BECAUSE YOU WERE JUST WORKING ALL THE TIME. YOU DESERVE THAT. VD: I HAD TO PUT ALL THAT SEXUAL FRUSTRATION SOMEWHERE. I WASN’T GETTING ANY SEX, SO I HAD TO PUT ALL THAT ENERGY SOMEWHERE. RO: WHY WEREN’T YOU HAVING SEX? YOU TOTALLY COULD HAVE HAD SEX. WHAT WAS YOUR BLOCK, DO YOU THINK? VD: I HAVE A LOT OF RELIGIOUS DAMAGE. WE ALL HAVE DAMAGE, OF COURSE. BUT I HAVE A LOT OF RELIGIOUS DAMAGE, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I WENT TO THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL. RO: SO DID RON, HE HAD THAT TOO. RON HAD A LOT OF MINISTRY IN HIS LIFE, SO BOTH OF YOU HAD A HEAVY CROSS TO BEAR, SO TO SPEAK. VD: COMPLETELY. RO: HOW COME YOU DIDN’T GO TO THE MEAT RACK [A QUEER B/D SEX CLUB IN EAST HOLLYWOOD] WITH US? VD: OH, I WENT TO THE MEAT RACK, HONEY. RO: DIDN’T THEY EAT YOU UP? VD: NO. WHENEVER I’D GO TO THE MEAT RACK, THE MEN WOULD SEE ME AND THEN GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BOTH ME AND [MUSICIAN] GLEN MEADMORE. OH, GOD, MISS MEADMORE. SHE’S EVEN WORSE THAN I AM. WE BOTH HAVE A QUALITY THAT KIND OF UPSETS MEN. IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING TO DEAL WITH. MEN JUST DIDN’T TAKE TO ME. WHEN I WAS IN MY TWENTIES, I THOUGHT, “OH, WELL, I HAVEN’T MET ANYONE FOR A RELATIONSHIP, AND NO ONE’S INTERESTED IN HAVING SEX WITH ME, BUT I’M STILL YOUNG. IT’LL HAPPEN.” BUT THEN MY THIRTIES CAME, AND THEN MY FORTIES, AND STILL, NOTHING. THEN I REALIZED THAT, “WELL, NOT EVERYBODY’S MEANT TO BE PARTNERED, I GUESS, AND NOT EVERYONE IS MEANT TO HAVE A SEX LIFE,” BECAUSE IT JUST WASN’T HAPPENING. I’M THE KIND OF PERSON WHO JUST DELVES INTO OTHER THINGS. I WAS CONSTANTLY WORKING AND CREATING. IN A WAY, IT’S BEEN A SAVING GRACE. RO: BUT YOU HAD FANS. VD: HAVING THIS RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND—IT WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT HELD ME BACK. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE HAVING A VAGINA DENTATA, WHICH WAS GOOD IN A WAY BECAUSE THAT KEPT ME FROM BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. BUT A LIFE WITH NO RISK IS NO FUN. AND SO MANY PEOPLE I KNEW WERE DYING OF AIDS BACK IN THE EARLY ’80S, WHICH WAS JUST TERRIFYING. I DIDN’T WANT TO GET ANYTHING THAT PENICILLIN COULDN’T CURE, SO I JUST REFUSED TO OPEN MYSELF UP AND LET SOMEONE IN. WITH A PERSONA, IT’S EASY TO GRAB CUTE BOYS AND SAY, “LOOK, YOU’RE SO HOT, YOU’RE MY NEW BOYFRIEND.” BUT I GREW UP IN AN ALL-FEMININE HOUSEHOLD WITH ONLY SISTERS. THERE WEREN’T ANY MEN IN OUR WORLD AT ALL, AND MY MOTHER WAS A LESBIAN, SO I HAVE THIS THING WHERE I’M SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO MEN, BUT I DON’T REALLY LIKE THEM. I HAVE VERY FEW CLOSE MALE FRIENDS. YOU KNOW THAT ABOUT ME. I DON’T HAVE MANY MALE FRIENDS BECAUSE I DON’T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE MALE WORLD. THAT, I THINK, IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I HAVEN’T CONNECTED WITH ANYONE UNTIL JUST RECENTLY. THIS YOUNG PERSON SHOWED AN INTEREST IN ME, AND BELIEVE ME, I WAS SHOCKED. I’M A SIXTY-THREE-YEAR-OLD LADY. AND HE’S TWENTY-EIGHT. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH A TWENTY-EIGHT-YEAR-OLD? RO: I CAN TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WITH HIM! BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK CHANGED? WHAT MADE YOU RECEPTIVE ALL OF A SUDDEN? VD: I DON’T KNOW. I’M A NERVOUS NELLIE, LET’S PUT IT THAT WAY. I’M VERY CAUTIOUS, AND I’VE NEVER WANTED TO BE A FOOL FOR LOVE. I GUESS THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT, TOO, BUT YOU’VE GOT TO OPEN YOURSELF. YOU HAVE TO LET YOURSELF BE VULNERABLE, AND I GUESS I WAS WAY TOO AFRAID TO DO THAT. AND THAT’S JUST PART OF LIFE. YOU CAN’T JUST AVOID IT—YOU HAVE TO GET HURT. BUT ONE THING ABOUT NOT HAVING A SEXUAL LIFE ALL THESE YEARS IS THAT IT’S KEPT ME KIND OF YOUTHFUL, BECAUSE I HAVEN’T HAD THE SAME KINDS OF STRESSES AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS OUT LOOKING FOR LOVE AND GETTING INTO THESE DOOMED RELATIONSHIPS. AVOIDING ALL THAT HAS KEPT ME, IN A CERTAIN WAY, INNOCENT AND YOUTHFUL. I’VE ALWAYS DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE. IT’S NEVER BEEN ANY OTHER WAY.

I FIND RICK OWENS STANDING NEXT TO A SEA OF BODIES. “COME WALK WITH ME,” HE SAYS. IT’S THURSDAY MORNING, SHORTLY BEFORE THE ICONOCLASTIC AMERICAN DESIGNER’S PARIS FASHION WEEK TIME SLOT. WE’RE BACKSTAGE IN A CONCRETE WING OF THE PALAIS DE TOKYO. IT’S MUCH MORE CROWDED THAN USUAL. THIS SEASON, OWENS CAST EXACTLY 200 MODELS TO WALK IN HIS SHOW. MOST ARE GROUPED TOGETHER WAITING TO GET OWENS’S FINAL APPROVAL, A SEA OF CREAMY GAUZE AND POINTY SHOULDERS PUNCTUATED BY STRANGE HEADWEAR THAT BRINGS TO MIND STAR WARS AND DUNE. OWENS WADES IN, STOPPING IN FRONT OF A WOMAN WITH BIRD-LIKE BONE STRUCTURE WHOSE HEAD IS FRAMED BY A CRUNCHY LEATHER HOOD. “ARE YOU A STUDENT?” OWENS ASKS. “NO, BUT I’M A BIG FAN,” SHE GUSHES. “YOU’RE SUCH AN ICON. YOU’RE MY FAVORITE DESIGNER.” OWENS LOOKS AT HER THROUGH SPORTY BLACK READING GLASSES PERCHED ON THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE. HIS BLACK LACQUERED FINGERNAILS DANCE AROUND HER NECK AS HE SNAPS A SERIES OF BUTTONS TOGETHER. HE SMILES. “WELL, THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.” RICK OWENS SHOWS TYPICALLY FEEL LIKE OPEN- AIR ROCK CONCERTS, WITH HIS CULT OF BLACK-CLAD DEVOTEES LINED UP OUTSIDE THE GATES FOR HOURS BEFOREHAND TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THEIR FASHION GOD AND HIS PYROTECHNIC-FUELED PRODUCTIONS. BUT IN JANUARY, CITING THE “BARBARIC TIMES” WE LIVE IN, OWENS DECIDED TO MOVE FROM HIS TRADITIONAL PALAIS DE TOKYO SHOW LOCATION TO THE PARIS HOME HE SHARES WITH HIS WIFE MICHÈLE LAMY. THE MODELS STALKED THROUGH HIS LIVING ROOM BEFORE AN INTIMATE CROWD OF EDITORS WHO SAT ON OWENS’S FURNITURE. “I FELT A FESTIVAL ATMOSPHERE WAS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS MOMENT IN TIME,” HE TOLD ME AT THE TIME. BUT OWENS FELT GUILTY FOR EXCLUDING HIS COMMUNITY BY MOVING TO A MORE EXCLUSIVE SCALE. SAYS OWENS, “I THOUGHT, OH, I HAVE TO RECTIFY THIS. AND HOW DO I RECTIFY IT? INVITE THEM ALL TO BE IN THE SHOW!” IT’S ABOUT 45 MINUTES BEFORE WHAT IS CLEARLY SHAPING UP TO BE ONE OF HIS MOST UNFORGETTABLE SPECTACLES IN A CAREER FULL OF THEM, AND OWENS HAS A LOT OF MODELS TO GET THROUGH. HE LOOKS AROUND FOR MORE DARK FASHION DRUIDS AND WRAITHS THAT HE HASN’T ZHUZHED YET. “I JUST HAD THEM CHANGE THE MUSIC TO MAKE IT HARDER,” HE SAYS OVER THE HYPER TECHNO TRACK BLARING IN THE BACKGROUND. OWENS PLANNED A COLLECTION OF TEN LOOKS THAT WERE REPEATED TWENTY TIMES EACH, ALL IN VARIOUS SHADES OF CREAM. (OWENS FIGURED HIS TYPICALLY DARK PALETTE WOULD LOOK TOO SINISTER.) BACKSTAGE, I’M SURROUNDED BY AIRY CHIFFON CAPES, HOODED BIKER JACKETS, DENIM TEXTURED WITH A CRUSTY GOLD COATING, SILKY VAMPIRIC COATS AND HABIT-LIKE ROBES, AND SPIDERY KNIT BODYSUITS, ALL OF WHICH CLING IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS TO THE 200 SHAPES AND SIZES OF HIS CAST, MADE UP OF SOME RICK OWENS RUNWAY REGULARS BUT MOSTLY BY THE LOCAL DESIGN STUDENTS WHO IDOLIZE HIM AND HIS AVANT-GARDE CITADEL OF RIGHTEOUS INDEPENDENT FASHION. “IT WAS AN EXERCISE IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO ACCOMMODATE EVERY SINGLE BODY TYPE AND HOW TO MAKE, BUT HOW TO MAKE IT A RICK OWENS LOOK,” HE SAID LATER. “ARE YOU A STUDENT?” HE ASKS ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE. THE BABY-FACED MODEL, WHO SOUNDS A BIT MORE NERVOUS THAN HE LOOKS, SAYS HE GOES TO THE INSTITUT FRANÇAIS DE LA MODE. “I’VE NEVER VISITED IFM, I PROBABLY SHOULD AT SOME POINT. EXCUSE ME, I’M GOING TO BE A LITTLE ROUGH.” OWENS GRABS HIS HOOD WITH BOTH HANDS AND CRUSHES IT AROUND THE YOUNG MAN’S COLLARBONE. THE TITLE OF THE COLLECTION IS “HOLLYWOOD,” THE PLACE WHERE RICHARD OWENS OF SMALL-TOWN PORTERVILLE, CA REINVENTED HIMSELF AS RICK OWENS. I NOTE HIS SHOWS HAVE BEEN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL OF LATE—JANUARY WAS AN ANGSTY ODE TO HIS HOMETOWN. “THAT’S RIGHT,” HE SAYS. “THE MORE I SEE THE FASHION WORLD EVOLVE AND HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR ANYONE TO HAVE A SINGULAR VOICE, THE MORE I REALIZE THAT THAT’S OUR STRENGTH. OUR STRENGTH IS THAT THIS IS A ONE- MAN SHOW INSTEAD OF A COMMITTEE DECISION, AND SO I EMPHASIZE THAT AND I CELEBRATE IT. AND I FEEL LIKE THAT’S WHY PEOPLE COME TO ME, BECAUSE IT FEELS PERSONAL. THEY KNOW THAT IT’S NOT STRATEGY OR CALCULATION OR… UM… DO I WANT TO USE THE WORD ‘FALSENESS’?” HE’S PREPPING THE MODELS TO WALK IN REGIMENTED FORMATION AROUND THE ART DECO COURTYARD OUTSIDE IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE TITLE CHARACTER’S ENTRANCE INTO ROME IN PIONEERING BLACK-AND-WHITE AUTEUR CECIL B. DEMILLE’S 1934 FILM CLEOPATRA. “IF YOU WATCH THAT MOVIE, WHICH I DO A LOT, IT IS SO SUMPTUOUS, YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE WAY THE FABRICS FALL THAT THEY DON’T MAKE FABRICS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. IT’S JUST OPULENCE, OPULENCE, OPULENCE. THAT WAS MY FANTASY IN PORTERVILLE, THAT WAS WHERE I WANTED TO END UP,” HE SAYS. PROPELLED BY DEMILLE’S ALLEGORIES OF “LURID SIN” AND “MORAL REDEMPTION,” OWENS ENDED UP LIVING IN SEEDY CIRCUMSTANCES OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. “THAT’S WHERE I INVENTED MYSELF,” HE SAYS. “HOLLYWOOD IS REALLY THAT MIX OF ‘WALK ON THE WILD SIDE’ BY LOU REED AND GLAMOR AND SLEAZE. HOLLYWOOD WAS WHERE I BECAME ME. I JUST JUMPED INTO A LIFE OF DECADENT HEDONISTIC SLEAZE, BECAUSE MY YOUTH HAD BEEN SO PROTECTED. AND I WANTED TO LIVE!” THIS SHOW, HE CONTINUES AS HE FIRMLY FIXES ANOTHER HOOD, IS “HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AND CECIL B. DEMILLE AT THE SAME TIME.” “BEAUTY IS PAIN,” HE ASSURES THE MODEL HE’S GOT BY THE THROAT. SINCE HIS CAST IS MADE UP OF HUGE RICK OWENS STANS, MANY BEGIN LIGHTLY QUIVERING AS HE APPROACHES FOR A FINAL UP-DOWN. “BEAUTIFUL!” RICK DECLARES ONE LOOK. “THANKS SO MUCH,” THE MODEL SAYS. “NO,” REPLIES OWENS, “THANK YOU.” ONE MAN ASKS HIM A QUESTION IN FRENCH. “OH I DON’T SPEAK FRENCH, BUT THANK YOU! THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US,” SAYS OWENS, WHO MOVED TO PARIS IN 2003. “I’M LEARNING FRENCH ACTUALLY,” HE TELLS ME. HE BEGAN AROUND CHRISTMAS. “I’M FLABBERGASTED AT HOW MUCH I CANNOT RETAIN. IT’S KIND OF HUMILIATING, BUT I’VE TOLD MYSELF THAT I DON’T EVER HAVE TO LEARN FRENCH, IT’S JUST FOR THE EXERCISE OF LEARNING SOMETHING.” ANOTHER MODEL ASKS OWENS TO PRETEND TO ADJUST THE COLLAR OF HIS SILK HABIT SO HIS FRIEND CAN TAKE A PHOTO. “ALRIGHT!” THE DESIGNER SAYS. “C’MON, LET’S GO.” HE IS CLEARLY HAVING A BLAST. I TELL OWENS THAT I’M PICKING UP ON WHAT’S BEEN A COMMON THEME THIS FASHION WEEK: THE IMPENDING PARIS OLYMPICS. IS THIS THE RICK OWENS OPENING CEREMONY? “IT DID SEEM LIKE AN APPROPRIATE THING TO DO, THAT WAS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,” HE SAYS. IN A MOMENT OF SIGNATURE OWENSIAN THEATER, THE FLAG OF THE RICK OWENS REPUBLIC IS SET TO FLY DOWN THE RUNWAY ATOP WHAT OWENS CALLS A “GYMNAST BOUQUET”: EIGHT MUSCLE-MEN BEARING A FRAMEWORK THAT HOLDS THREE CONTORTIONISTS, ONE BEARING A FLAG OF TWO SINEWY ARMS CLASPING HANDS. (THE ARMS BELONG TO OWENS AND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS.) “IT’S DUDESHIP,” HE SAYS. “RESPECT THE DUDESHIP.” OF COURSE, THERE’S ALWAYS A CRISIS. GUESTS ARE FILING IN OUTSIDE AS A MODEL TAPS OWENS ON THE BROAD SHOULDER OF HIS COAT, AS LONG AND BLACK AS HIS SIGNATURE HAIRDO. “WHAT DO YOU NEED?” OWENS ASKS. THE MODEL POINTS TO A STREAK OF TAN MAKEUP ACROSS HIS CHIFFON HOOD. “WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT,” OWENS SAYS, MOVING ON. “THE EYE WILL ACCEPT IT!” THE RICK OWENS BRIGADES ARE STARTING TO BE SENT TO THE LINEUP. OWENS APPEARS SATISFIED AND TOTALLY RELAXED AMIDST ALL OF THE CHAOS HE’S CREATED. “IT’S A STORY ABOUT SHARING AND UNITY,” HE SAYS, LOOKING FOR A FEW MORE STRAY HOODS. “THE TIMES THAT WE’RE LIVING IN, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM ON THE PLANET IS INTOLERANCE WHICH IS THE BASIS OF ALL WAR. THAT IS THE GLORY AND THE HORROR OF HUMAN EXISTENCE. BUT SOMEBODY LIKE ME, I’M ABLE TO INTRODUCE OR TO PROMOTE TOLERANCE IN CERTAIN WAYS BY PROMOTING AESTHETICS THAT AREN’T NECESSARILY STANDARD. MY ROLE IS TO BE PART OF THE FORCE IN THE WORLD THAT PROMOTES TOLERANCE, AND THERE’S ANOTHER FORCE THAT PROMOTES INTOLERANCE, AND IT’S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOREVER AND EVER. BUT SO FAR, WE’RE STILL HERE.” HE CHUCKLES. “WE HAVEN’T BEEN NUKED YET.” HE FIXES THE SNAPS ON ONE LAST HOOD, CRUSHING THE LEATHER BETWEEN HIS HANDS UNTIL IT CRUMPLES INTO A PERFECTLY TORTURED HALO AROUND THE MODEL’S HEAD. HE PATS HER ON THE SHOULDER. “YES!” HE SHOUTS. “HAVE FUN!” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

WHILE THE EPONYMOUS BRAND&#39;S SHOWS AND PARTIES ARE DREAMY, WITH DANTEAN SCENES TEEMING WITH FREAKISH ALIENS, GIANTS, AND QUASI-MYTHOLOGICAL BEINGS, THE DESIGNER HIMSELF IS A MORE RESERVED TYPE. AT FIRST GLANCE, HE MAY APPEAR UNAPPROACHABLE AND CRUEL, RESEMBLING SAURON FROM “LORD OF THE RINGS.” HE IS SLENDER, STANDING ALMOST TWO METERS TALL WITH HIS KISS PLATFORM SHOES INSPIRED BY GRACE JONES AND KISS COSTUME DESIGNER LARRY LEGASPI. DESPITE THIS APPEARANCE, HE IS ACTUALLY QUITE FRIENDLY. “DURING THE COVID YEARS,” HE SAYS, “WE HELD FOUR LIVESTREAM RUNWAY SHOWS ON THE LIDO WITHOUT AUDIENCES- TWO ON THE BEACH, ONE UTILIZING THE TEMPIO VOTIVO (SPARKING PUBLIC ANGER, FOLLOWING AN IMMEDIATE APOLOGY, ED.), AND ONE ON THE GRAD PIAZZA OF THE LIDO CASINO.” “THE TEMPIO VOTIVO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BUILDINGS EVER, AND IN A WATER TAXI AT THE END OF THE EVENING IN VENICE, SEEING IT ACROSS THE WATER MEANS I AM ALMOST HOME….. THE LIDO CASINO IS PART OF MY DAILY LIFE- WHEN I RENOVATED MY APARTMENT A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM IT; MY GOAL WAS TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A PART OF THAT BUILDING….” HE HAS BEEN SPENDING HIS SUMMERS THERE SINCE 2011, AND IN 2016, HE BOUGHT A HOUSE AND RENOVATED IT WITH MARBLE, MIRRORS, CONCRETE, AND A 360-DEGREE VIEW OF THE ADRIATIC SEA. HIS HOUSE LIES JUST A FEW STEPS FROM THE LEGENDARY HOTEL EXCELSIOR AT THE EPICENTER OF HIGH SOCIETY FOR A DOZEN DAYS A YEAR, BUT FAR AWAY FROM THE TORRENTS OF FOREIGN TOURISTS THAT FILL THE CITY EVERY DAY, PUNCTUATED BY A FEW IMPATIENT RESIDENTS. “THE LIDO IS TEN MINUTES AWAY FROM THE GRAND CANAL BUT A WORLD APART,” HE EXPLAINS. “IT HAS THE MODESTY AND SERENITY OF A SMALL VILLAGE IGNORED BY THE CROWDS FLOCKING TO PIAZZA SAN MARCO. IT’S PERFECT FOR RETREATING TO AFTER VISITING THE FUTURISM OF CONTEMPORARY ART SPACES IN THE ANCIENT DENSENESS OF VENICE ITSELF. THE LIDO ACTUALLY REMINDS ME OF THE SMALL CALIFORNIA TOWN I GREW UP IN….” THE TOWN WHERE HE WAS BORN IN 1961 IS PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA. THIS SMALL TOWN HAS A POPULATION OF 53,000 AND LIES AT THE FOOT OF THE SIERRA NEVADA, LIKE MUCH OF SMALL-TOWN AMERICA, IT IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CANNOT BE DIFFERENT. A PLACE WHERE THE CATHOLIC CODES ARE STIFLING BUT MEANINGLESS BECAUSE PERHAPS WITHIN FAMILIES, LIKE WITH HIS FAMILY, PEOPLE PRAY BUT COLLECT FIREARMS AT THE SAME TIME. AT THE VENICE LIDO, OWENS GIVES NEW MEANING TO THE SINCERITY OF A PLACE IMMERSED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE. BECAUSE IN VENICE, YOU ARE CONSTANTLY SURROUNDED BY CULTURE, BEAUTY, AND EXCITEMENT, EVEN IF YOU DON’T WANT TO BE. AND IT IS HERE THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, SEE, AND MAYBE EVEN FINALLY EXPERIENCE THE MEANING OF A SINGULAR CHILDHOOD: IN THIS COMMUNITY, THERE IS NO TELEVISION UNTIL YOU ARE SIXTEEN, AND WHOLE DAYS ARE SPENT LEARNING ABOUT RICHARD WAGNER, GIACOMO PUCCINI, GIUSEPPE VERDI, AND READING MARCEL PROUST. THIS UPBRINGING STIMULATES AND SHAPES THE ALREADY PROFOUND SENSIBILITY OF LITTLE RICHARD SATURNINO OWENS, HIS FULL NAME AT BIRTH. “I REMEMBER LISTENING TO PUCCINI’S MADAME BUTTERFLY WHEN I WAS YOUNG (MY FATHER HAD AN HOUR OF TEA AND INCENSE AND CLASSICAL MUSIC EVERY DAY), AND THE DRAMA OF BETRAYAL, SELFLESSNESS, AND TRANSCENDENCE WHILE DYING IMPRESSED ME DEEPLY. PUCCINI’S NESSUN DORMA ALSO MOVED ME WITH ITS GLORIOUS YEARNING. …MY YOUTH WAS FILLED WITH EXOTIC STORIES OF LA TRAVIATA, NORMA, AIDA… STORIES OF LONGING, SACRIFICE, ECSTASY, AND DEATH THAT I BELIEVED FORMING ME. GRAVITATING TOWARD THE CULTURE THAT PRODUCED THIS KIND OF PRIMAL EMOTION WAS MY FATE… FELLINI, BERTOLUCCI, PASOLINI ALL HAD A RAW GRITTY VIBE THAT SEEMED SO MUCH MORE HONEST THAN OTHER MOVIES I WAS WATCHING WHEN I WAS BECOMING AWARE OF WHICH DIRECTION I WANTED TO GO IN LIFE…I THINK THEY HELPED ME DECIDE. SORRY TO BE SO CLICHÉ BUT MAHLER&#39;S SYMPHONY NO. 5 SET TO VISCONTI’S DEATH IN VENICE WILL ALWAYS REPRESENT MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE VENICE I SAW IN MY TEENS IN A CALIFORNIA MOVIE THEATRE WITHOUT EVEN HAVING THE IMAGINATION TO DREAM I WOULD EVER GO THERE.” MANY DESIGNERS OF HIS CALIBER WOULD CHOOSE ROYAL RESIDENCES ON THE GRAND CANAL OR IN THE SAN MARCO AREA, BECOMING A PIECE OF THE POSTCARD MOSAIC AND REINFORCING OSTENTATIOUS POWER CLICHÉS BY ERECTING IVORY TOWERS AT THE CENTER OF PUBLIC, HIGHLY TRAFFICKED AREAS. ON THE OTHER HAND, RICK OWENS HAS SETTLED AT THE EDGE OF THE HUBBUB ON THAT OBLONG ISLAND, WHICH IS ONLY A FEW KILOMETERS AWAY, ALWAYS SLEEPY EXCEPT WHEN THE CURTAIN RISES ON THE FILM FESTIVAL. OWENS&#39; FACE AND EYES ARE ALIVE WITH A PAST PUNCTUATED BY INTENSE EXPERIENCES, WHICH ARE EMBODIED IN HIS FASHION DESIGNS. AS HE EXPLAINED IN A NEW YORK TIMES INTERVIEW A LONG TIME AGO, HE STOPPED DRINKING AND TAKING HARD DRUGS AT THE AGE OF FIFTY. TODAY, HE LOOKS BACK ON THOSE TIMES THAT HE CALLS A “TEMPORARY SUICIDE” WITHOUT ANY REMORSE OR REGRET BECAUSE, IN THAT DARKNESS, HE HAS OFTEN FOUND BURSTS OF BEAUTY THAT HAVE TRANSFORMED INTO CLOTHING CREATIONS. THE IMAGES FROM A 1988 MTV CLUB INTERVIEW WHERE, AS A 27-YEAR-OLD, HE PRESENTED HIS VERY FIRST CREATIONS AND DISPLAYED HIS CONFIDENT AND SOMEWHAT RECKLESS ATTITUDE ARE UNFORGETTABLE. HE HAD BEEN TURNED ON TO PRODUCTION BY HIS FUTURE WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LOS ANGELES AT THE TIME, DESIGNING A LINE OF JERSEY DRESSES SOLD UNDER HIS LAST NAME. OWENS CAME TO L.A. TO STUDY AT OTIS COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN, AND MEETING LAMY WAS PIVOTAL: IN 1990, HE BEGAN WORKING FOR HER AS A PATTERNMAKER. IT TOOK THEM TWO YEARS TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER, AND THEY EVENTUALLY WORKED SO WELL TOGETHER THAT MICHÈLE LEFT HER HUSBAND TO PARTNER WITH HIM. THEY LAUNCHED RICK&#39;S LINE IN LOS ANGELES IN 1994 AND MOVED TO PARIS IN 2003, CHOOSING TO STAY THERE PERMANENTLY. NOW, HE’S A FASHION ICON, AND HIS RESIDENCIES INCLUDE ONE IN THE VENETIAN LAGOON. HOWEVER, HE SAYS, “I HAVE ALWAYS AVOIDED THE CARNEVALE AND THE FILM FESTIVAL – THERE IS A JOSTLING ARTIFICIAL INTENSITY THAT I USED TO ENJOY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THAT NOW IS NOT FOR ME. I ENJOY THE QUIETER, MORE MELANCHOLY SIDE OF VENICE.” THIS INCREASINGLY ARTIFICIAL AND PLASTIC WORLD DOES NOT PARTICULARLY CHARM HIM: “I HAVE NEVER REALLY COURTED CELEBRITY EXPOSURE, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WE HAVE CERTAINLY BENEFITED FROM IT. AS A SMALL INDEPENDENT LABEL, WE DON’T GIVE AWAY CLOTHES OR PAY CELEBRITIES TO ENDORSE OUR PRODUCTS, BUT THE ATTENTION THEIR ENDORSEMENT GETS WHEN THEY BUY SOMETHING AND WEAR IT IS DEFINITELY IMPRESSIVE.” EVERY CELEBRITY HAS WALKED A RED CARPET IN RICK OWENS, FROM ZENDAYA, BILLIE EILISH, KIM KARDASHIAN, AND TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET. BUT NO ONE SEES THE OWENS COUPLE ON THOSE SAME RED CARPETS. I IMAGINE THEM VISITING THE DESERTED ALLEYS AT NIGHT, WANDERING LIKE CURIOUS SHADOWS THROUGH THE SAME PLACES THAT, BY DAY, ARE STORMED BY HORDES, OFTEN DISRESPECTFUL OF THE MAGIC AND HISTORY IN THE STONES THEY TREAD ON. VENICE IS A DREAMLIKE PLACE, BECOMING EVEN MORE DREAMY WHEN YOU ARE AWAKE AND ENTER THIS “ORIENTAL CITY’S MAZE,” AS PROUST WROTE. BUT IT IS BETTER TO DO IT WHEN NO ONE IS AROUND. VENICE STAYS WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU DON&#39;T REALIZE IT, LIKE OWENS&#39; FASHION, WHICH, WHILE EXTREME, DISRUPTIVE, AND ALIEN, IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE PAST AND TRADITION. IT IS NOT COINCIDENTAL IN RECENT SEASONS; HE HAS BEEN AMONG THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DESIGNERS EMULATED BY FASHION STUDENTS. “I THINK THE ANCIENT IS ALWAYS THE NEW MODERN. THERE IS SO MUCH PAST BEAUTY OUR CURRENT GENERATION ISN’T EVEN FULLY AWARE OF. WE COULD JUST START THE HISTORY OF AESTHETICS ALL OVER AGAIN AND REVEL IN HOW NEW IT WOULD FEEL,” HE NOTES. THROUGH HIS FILTER, OF COURSE: “THERE IS A DENSE AND PATINATED OPULENCE TO ITALIAN CLASSICISM THAT AS A BLUNT AMERICAN, I FEEL I ABSORB, CONDENSE, DISTILL, AND INTERPRET IN MY OWN VERY REDUCED WAY…MY AESTHETIC GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DRAG A BIT OF RADICAL FANTASY INTO EVERYDAY LIVING…WHICH ALWAYS ENDS UP LOOKING A BIT ALIEN.” SOMETHING LIKE HIS FASHION SHOW AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN PARIS LAST JUNE. JUST AS THE PREVIOUS TWO SHOWS HAD TAKEN PLACE AT HIS HOME FOR A MORE INTIMATE SETTING (THEY WERE INDEED TITLED PORTERVILLE, AFTER THE SMALL TOWN HE ESCAPED FROM), HE CALLED THIS LAST ONE HOLLYWOOD TO CELEBRATE THE HUB WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED MANY STRANGER CHARACTERS THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. THIS SHOW FEATURED ELEVEN ENSEMBLES OF TWENTY MODELS OF ALL SIZES, GENDERS, AND ETHNICITIES DESCENDING THE MAJESTIC STEPS OF AVENUE DU PRESIDENT WILSON. IN ADDITION TO THE AVOWED REFERENCES TO MYTHICAL BLOCKBUSTERS MIXED WITH ART DECO INTRUSIONS, I WAS IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT BACK TO THE MOST SENSATIONAL REPRESENTATIONS OF AIDA’S TRIUMPHAL MARCH, AS THE SHOW SPRUNG FROM ITS BACKGROUND. THE PALETTE OF LIGHT NUANCES WAS REMINISCENT OF WORKS BY JOHN RUSKIN, A WRITER AND PAINTER WITH STRONG TIES TO VENICE, WHERE HE SPENT ENTIRE SEASONS IN HIS ROOM AT THE PENSIONE CALCINA ON THE ZATTERE. THE THEATRICALITY OF THE ENSEMBLES ALSO HARKED BACK TO THE CROWDS AT PIAZZA SAN MARCO DURING CARNIVAL. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DRAPERIES, SILHOUETTES, AND SET CONSTRUCTIONS WERE AN HOMAGE TO THE MASTERY OF MARIANO FORTUNY, ANOTHER VENETIAN BY ADOPTION. “I STUDIED THE MODERNISM OF MARIANO FORTUNY WHEN I WAS YOUNG AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN MY SMALL CALIFORNIA TOWN,” OWENS RECALLS. “I THINK I COPIED THAT MIX OF MODERN AND THE ANCIENT THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AS RADICAL AS PUNK ROCK IN ITS TIME. MARIANO FORTUNY&#39;S INFLUENCE REMAINS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF MY AESTHETICS AND A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS ABLE TO RECOLOR SOME OF THE ORIGINAL PRINTS AND HAVE THEM APPLIED TO MY FABRICS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FORTUNY ESTATE.” NOT ONLY THAT, BUT OWENS IS ALSO A FASHION EXPLORER, A MARCO POLO OF AESTHETICS WHO VENTURES WHERE OTHERS DARE NOT GO. WHEN I ASK HIM IF I&#39;M WRONG OR IF CERTAIN TRADITIONAL COSTUMES IN THE LAGOON ARE REMINISCENT OF HIS DESIGNS, HE WRYLY REPLIES, “WHEN I SEE SOME OF THE CLOTHES IN THE PAINTINGS AT THE ACCADEMIA, I FEEL THE URGE TO GET MORE SUMPTUOUS.” ALTHOUGH HE WAS BORN THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY, OWENS UNEXPECTEDLY HAS MANY VENETIAN TRAITS. THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF GOLDONI, WHO INNOVATED THEATER WHILE MAINTAINING TRADITION, WITH A STRONG SENSE OF REALISM MARKED BY THE OBSERVATION OF SOCIETY AND SHOT THROUGH AN IRONIC LENS. THE MELANCHOLY OF THOMAS MAN, WHO IS IN DEATH IN VENICE, CAPTURES THE BEAUTY OF ITS DECADENCE, ELEGANCE, AND SENSE OF IMPERMANENCE BORN FROM THE TENSION BETWEEN BEAUTY AND DEATH. OWENS REPRODUCES THIS SAME TENSION IN HIS SOMETIMES-DISTURBING LEXICON: “IT IS THE PATINA OF THIS LEGENDARY HISTORY THAT CHARGES IT WITH SUCH GRAVITAS UNDERNEATH ITS DELICIOUS DELICACY,” HE CONCLUDES. “VENEZIA IS THE MOST IMPROBABLE, IMPRACTICAL CONFECTION THERE IS… SEEMINGLY FRAGILE BUT ENDURING AND ETERNAL.” THAT IS MOST TRUE, WHETHER RICK OWENS OR ANYONE ELSE SAYS IT.

A FEW YEARS AGO, HE RETURNED TO PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, THE TOWN WHERE HE GREW UP, AND FOR FALL 2024, HE BROUGHT PORTERVILLE TO HIS CURRENT HOME OF PARIS—AS IN, HE LITERALLY INVITED SHOW GUESTS OVER TO HIS HOUSE, A 19TH-CENTURY TOWNHOME-MEETS-BRUTALIST BULWARK THAT ONCE SERVED AS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY. THE FASHION WAS, AS IT ALWAYS IS AT A RICK OWENS SHOW, A MELDING OF THE SUBLIME AND THE PERVERSE: SCULPTURAL, WIRELIKE TANGLES OF COTTON VOILE AND MESH; SPIKY, REPTILIAN BOOTS. NAMED FOR HIS HOMETOWN, THE COLLECTION “WAS KIND OF A CELEBRATION,” HE SAYS IN HIS CALIFORNIA INFLECTION, HIS SYLLABLES FLAT AND DRY AS THE MOJAVE DESERT. “I WAS ABLE TO CREATE THE WORLD I WAS YEARNING FOR IN PORTERVILLE. IT MIGHT NOT HAVE WORKED OUT, BUT IT DID.” THAT MIGHT BE THE THESIS STATEMENT OF OWENS’S CAREER. IN PORTERVILLE, WHICH HE PORTRAYS AS MAIN STREET, USA, HE FELT “OPPRESSED AND AFRAID AND ASHAMED.” THERE WAS HIS QUEERNESS (HE IDENTIFIES AS BISEXUAL), HIS SELF-DESCRIBED “SISSINESS,” HIS GENERAL QUALITY OF NOT BELONGING. ONE PORTAL OUT WAS FRANK FRAZETTA, WHOSE FANTASY ART DECORATED THE PAPERBACKS HIS FATHER READ TO HIM, AND FEATURED “THE MOST GLAMOROUS, HEROIC, SEXY-LOOKING PEOPLE WHO WERE PURSUING A NEXT LEVEL OF LIVING,” HE REMEMBERS. ANOTHER WAS CATHOLIC SCHOOL, WHERE HE LEARNED THAT EVERYONE HAD A HIGHER PURPOSE, A CONCEPT THAT INTRIGUED HIM. “IT WAS ALL ABOUT STUDYING THESE CREATURES WEARING LONG ROBES THAT DRAGGED ON THE GROUND,” HE SAYS, “SAINTS AND NUNS AND PRIESTS PURSUING A HIGHER SPIRITUAL LEVEL.” THOUGH THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRANSCENDENCE WERE SCARCE, THEY WERE ALL THE MORE POWERFUL FOR IT. “IF I HAD BEEN LIVING ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE, BEING TAKEN TO MUSEUMS EVERY WEEKEND, I DON’T KNOW IF I WOULD’VE DEVELOPED THAT THIRST AND RAGE,” HE SAYS. WITH THIS COLLECTION, “I WAS CONDEMNING PORTERVILLE FOR BEING SUCH AN OPPRESSIVE PLACE, BUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THAT KIND OF TENSION IS WHAT MAKES SOMEBODY LIKE ME DO STUFF. THE WAY THAT MY FATHER, WHO I’VE ALWAYS MENTIONED WAS A BULLY WHO TAUGHT ME FEAR AND SHAME, ALSO TAUGHT ME ABOUT JAPANESE ART AND OPERA. WE WERE EXTREMELY AFFECTIONATE FRIENDS, BUT MORTAL ENEMIES AT THE SAME TIME. THE FEAR AND THE SHAME PROBABLY WORKED OUT....IT MOTIVATED ME.” FROM THERE, OWENS’S LIFE STORY ALMOST CALLS OUT FOR JUMP CUTS: TWENTYSOMETHING OWENS CRASHING ON A PILE OF BLANKETS AT A FRIEND’S WAREHOUSE STUDIO IN CULVER CITY. WHEN HE STAYED OUT LATE, HE’D SHIMMY UP THE EMERGENCY STAIRS AND GET IN THROUGH A WINDOW NEAR THE ROOF. (“I’D BE OUT IN THE RAIN, IN THIS BLACK VELVET CAPE WITH FULL MAKEUP,” HE SAYS. “THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC.”) STARTING HIS BRAND IN L.A. IN 1994—NOT BUILDING AN ARCHIVE THE WAY YOUNG DESIGNERS DO NOW, BECAUSE HE WASN’T THINKING ABOUT HIS LEGACY, BUT SIMPLY ABOUT SELLING CLOTHES. MEETING HIS WIFE, MICHELE LAMY, WHOM HE CALLS BOTH “THE CHICEST MIND THAT I’VE EVER COME UP AGAINST” AND “A PRIMITIVE LITTLE BEAST WHO TAKES WHAT SHE WANTS AND LEAVES WRECKAGE BEHIND HER.” THEY’VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 18 YEARS, WHICH HE CREDITS TO THE OPPOSITES-ATTRACT TENSION BETWEEN HIS RATIONALITY AND HER EMOTIONALITY. GETTING SOBER AT 40, WITH LAMY’S ENCOURAGEMENT. HIS FIRST SHOW IN PARIS IN 2003, A BREATH OF FRESH AIR ON FASHION’S MOST EXCLUSIVE CALENDAR. TODAY, OWENS IS ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE DESIGNERS IN THE WORLD AND A MAINSTAY AT PARIS FASHION WEEK, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CITY ONCE FELT, HE SAYS, AS FAR AWAY AS THE MOON. HE’S 22 YEARS SOBER, A FITNESS FANATIC WHO BLASTS KISS IN THE GYM (HE’S DRAWN TO THEIR “BIG HAPPY DUMB-DOG JUBILANCE”) AND A TAKER OF DAILY NAPS. IN A FRANTIC INDUSTRY, HE’S THE MOST RELAXED-SEEMING DESIGNER AROUND, EVEN IF YOU SENSE THAT IMAGE BELIES THE TOUGH-AS-NAILS CORE THAT GOT HIM HERE. HE DOESN’T SEEM SWAYED BY WHAT EVERY OTHER DESIGNER IS UP TO, THOUGH HE DOES PAY ATTENTION TO IT. THE ONLY PERSON HE’S IN COMPETITION WITH IS HIMSELF, BUT YOU SENSE THAT ALL THE PREVIOUS RICKS FOLLOW HIM AROUND. LIKE THE ONE HE WAS WHEN HE WAS STILL DRINKING TO THE POINT OF WHAT HE CALLS “TEMPORARY SUICIDE.” PART OF THE DRINKING WAS “BUILDING UP THE COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF TO THE WORLD AND INSIST THAT I HAD SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING AT. AND THAT ALMOST TAKES ARROGANCE,” HE SAYS. LOOKING BACK, HE THINKS, “‘HOW DID I HAVE THE NERVE TO THINK THAT EVERYBODY HAD TO SEE WHAT I WAS DOING?’ BLESS MY HEART.” WHEN HE FINALLY QUIT, LAMY HAD NURSES STAY WITH HIM AND ADMINISTER SEDATIVES SO HE DIDN’T HYPERVENTILATE TO DEATH. “I THOUGHT, ‘OH, IT FEELS SO MUCH BETTER NOT TO HAVE A HANGOVER.’” (COINCIDENTALLY, RIGHT AFTER HE STOPPED DRINKING, HIS CAREER TOOK OFF: HE SIGNED A DEAL TO MANUFACTURE HIS LINE IN ITALY AND GET DISTRIBUTION.) THE FITNESS BEGAN AS A COUNTERBALANCE TO THE DRINKING. “IT WAS MAINLY ABOUT VANITY, NOT HEALTH, I’M EMBARRASSED TO SAY. OR AM I? I’M NOT SURE I AM.” NOW HE’S REACHED A LEVEL HE COULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED OF, WHERE HE SIMULTANEOUSLY FEELS ACCESSIBLE AND NICHE. COLLABORATIONS WITH ADIDAS AND CONVERSE, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO THE MASSES, BUT HE RETAINS THE INDEPENDENCE THAT DRAWS SUPERFANS. HE ATTRIBUTES THIS FOLLOWING TO HIS BELIEF THAT “I DON’T THINK DESIGNERS ARE ALLOWED TO BE THAT HONEST. MOST OF THEM HAVE TO WORK FOR A COMPANY, AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF VOICES TO ANSWER TO. AND SO YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THERE’S A COMMITTEE THERE.…DO I REALLY WANT TO BUY A BAG FROM A COMPANY THAT I KNOW PAYS CELEBRITIES TO BE IN THEIR FRONT ROW? ARE THOSE THE VALUES THAT I WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH?” HE JOKES THAT “ON MY TOMBSTONE, I WILL BE RECOGNIZED FOR SNEAKERS. AND THAT’S NOT WHERE I WANTED TO GO AT ALL. MY SNEAKERS WERE A PARODY AT THE BEGINNING. I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING RIDICULOUS OR EXAGGERATED ENOUGH, BECAUSE I THOUGHT SNEAKERS WERE THE DREARIEST, MOST SUBURBAN THING. BUT I STARTED GOING TO THE GYM AND I NEEDED SOMETHING FLAMBOYANT AND THEATRICAL TO WEAR, SO I MADE THE MOST EXAGGERATED MONSTER TRUCK SNEAKERS I COULD THINK OF. I’M NOT COMPLAINING AT ALL, BUT IT’S JUST FUNNY HOW THAT’S GOING TO BE MY EPITAPH.” WITH HIS 30TH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR, OWENS HAS BEEN THINKING MORE ABOUT THE PAST. AND NOT JUST HIS DAYS IN PORTERVILLE. LAST YEAR, FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, HE RETURNED TO ANOTHER PLACE THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT MEANING FOR HIM: MEXICO, WHICH HIS MOTHER, CONCEPCIÓN, LEFT TO ELOPE WITH HIS AMERICAN FATHER, AND WHERE HE STILL HAS MANY RELATIVES. HE HAS BEEN EXPLORING “MY MEXICANNESS,” SOMETHING THAT HE HAD NOT IDENTIFIED WITH AS STRONGLY GROWING UP. AND HE’S BEEN THINKING FONDLY OF HIS LATE MOTHER, WHO LOVED TO SEW AND MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF THE REASON HE GOT INTO FASHION. NOW, AS HE PREPARES FOR A CAREER RETROSPECTIVE NEXT YEAR AT PARIS’S PALAIS GALLIERA—HE IS THE ONLY DESIGNER BESIDES MARTIN MARGIELA AND AZZEDINE ALAÏA TO HAVE RECEIVED THE HONOR DURING HIS LIFETIME—HE HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT A LEGACY MIGHT MEAN. “IS THAT LEAVING A FOUNDATION? LEAVING AN ARCHIVE? LEAVING A MOOD? I FEEL LIKE I’M PART OF A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE MAYBE GENTLY INFLUENCED AESTHETICS,” HE SAYS. “I WANT TO BE A RESOURCE FOR PEOPLE TO TURN TO WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY DON’T SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN CONTEMPORARY AESTHETICS THAT ARE VERY NARROW AND CONDEMNING AND SOMETIMES CRUEL.” SO HE TAKES JOY IN BRINGING “A GLEEFUL DEPRAVITY” TO HIS RUNWAYS. (HE LIKES USING PENTAGRAMS BECAUSE “IT’S MY LITTLE WAY OF HECKLING CONSERVATIVES.”) THE WORLD CAN FEEL MORE LIKE OWENS’S VISION OF PORTERVILLE EVERY DAY, SHUNNING ANYONE DIFFERENT AND CALCIFYING THE IDEA OF BEAUTY INTO OZEMPIC-CHISELED, BOTOXED SAMENESS. OWENS WANTS TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT REALITY. AFTER ALL, PROVOCATIVE ART “SAVED ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG,” HE SAYS. “I WANT TO BE THAT GUY FOR PEOPLE.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

THIS JOURNEY REFLECTS A CONVERSATION ABOUT TRANSFORMING FEAR INTO EMPOWERMENT. RICK OWENS, AN AMERICAN-BORN DESIGNER, HAS A FIVE-STORY PROPERTY IN THE 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS, CLOSE TO THE MUSÉE D&#39;ORSAY. THIS BUILDING USED TO SERVE AS THE OFFICES OF FRANÇOIS MITTERRAND. INSIDE, THE CLASSICIST ARCHITECTURE TAKES ON A BRUTALIST TWIST, FEATURING A COMBINATION OF STUCCO AND EXPOSED CONCRETE ILLUMINATED BY NEON LIGHTS. THE ROOMS ARE ADORNED WITH LARGE, CHUNKY TABLES AND ROWS OF SOFAS MADE FROM ROUGH COW LEATHER. ARTWORK IS THOUGHTFULLY DISPLAYED THROUGHOUT, INCLUDING DARK PAINTINGS, EERIE WAX SCULPTURES OF SHRUNKEN HEADS, AND A FREEZER CONTAINING SPERM FROM A FAMOUS RAPPER, ALL PROTECTED BY BULLETPROOF GLASS. OWENS NAVIGATES HIS SPACE WEARING OVERSIZED SNEAKERS, BLACK KNEE SOCKS, SHORTS, AND A MUSCLE SHIRT. HIS FANS REFER TO HIM AS THE &quot;LORD OF DARKNESS,&quot; WITH CELEBRITIES LIKE BEYONCÉ, ASAP ROCKY, TAYLOR SWIFT, AND KANYE WEST DONNING HIS DESIGNS. OWENS IS A REFLECTIVE AND EXCEPTIONALLY OPEN CONVERSATIONALIST; WHEN SOMETHING MATTERS TO HIM, HE EMPHASIZES IT BY SNAPPING HIS FINGERS. SZ-MAGAZIN: MR. OWENS, YOUR FASHION SHOWS FEATURE LATEX MASKS, HORNS, STRAP-ON WINGS, BODY PROSTHESES, AND INFLATABLE PLATFORM BOOTS. WHO IS YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE? RICK OWENS: FOR ME, MY FASHION IS INFLUENCED BY JAPANESE KABUKI THEATER, THE SCULPTURES OF BRANCUSI, AND THE ART OF DONALD JUDD. EVERY CREATIVE PERSON TAKES INSPIRATION FROM WHAT THEY&#39;VE SEEN AND CREATES A NEW, PERSONAL COMPOSITION FROM IT. EVERYTHING I CREATE HAS BEEN SEEN BEFORE AND IS FAMILIAR TO EVERYONE. BY &quot;EVERYONE,&quot; DO YOU MEAN YOUR SMALL BUT VERY WEALTHY FOLLOWING? I&#39;M NEITHER DIOR NOR GUCCI. I ONLY NEED TO PLEASE ONE PERSON: MYSELF. FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THAT, ALLOWING ME TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING. BEYOND THE STARS, YOUR FOLLOWING IS DRAWN FROM THE GOTHIC, QUEER, AND HEAVY METAL SCENES. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN COMMON WITH THESE PEOPLE? I THINK IT&#39;S MY MELODRAMA. I GREW UP WITHOUT A TELEVISION, BUT MY FATHER LOVED OPERA. AT FIRST, I HATED IT, BUT THEN I GREW INTO IT. OPERA IS ABOUT TRANSCENDENCE, ABOUT LIVING THROUGH A CONFLICT, IN LIFE, IN LOVE. SOMETIMES THIS TRANSFORMATION ENDS IN DEATH. AND: OPERAS ARE INCREDIBLY RAUNCHY! THAT CAN LEAVE AN IMPRESSION ON A TEN-YEAR-OLD. MY SENSE OF MAGIC, OF RITUALS, ATTRACTS CERTAIN PEOPLE. IN 2022, YOU INTRODUCED PORTABLE FOG MACHINES AS FASHION ACCESSORIES. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT? FOG IS ONE OF MY LEITMOTIFS. FOG IS CHEAP, BOMBASTIC, BIG. IT APPEARS IN DISCOS, IN CHURCHES, AND IN NATURE. IT IS MYSTERIOUS AND MAGICAL. IT IS CHEAP MAGIC. HOW MANY DID THEY SELL? I&#39;D HAVE TO ASK. (OWENS BRINGS OUT A SMALL SQUARE SUITCASE CONTAINING ONE OF THE FOG MACHINES.) THE RAPPER TRAVIS SCOTT USED IT FOR AN APPEARANCE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. ON LOAN. AN ACCESSORY FOR ECCENTRIC POP STARS. DON&#39;T YOU THINK SO? I HAVE ONE TOO. WE HAVE SOME THAT YOU CAN ATTACH TO YOUR SHOE. OR A BIG ONE THAT ROLLS AROUND ON WHEELS. I HAVE SIX OF THEM IN MY APARTMENT IN CONCORDIA, SICILY, AS SIDE TABLES. WHAT IS YOUR FASHION ABOUT? FANTASIES THAT CAN BECOME REALITY. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IRRITATED BY MALE DESIGNERS WHO FIRST SEND MODELS DOWN THE RUNWAY IN HIGH HEELS, HUGE DRESSES, AND HATS AND THEN AFTERWARD LET THEMSELVES BE CELEBRATED ON THE RUNWAY IN JEANS, T-SHIRTS, AND SNEAKERS. THE MESSAGE BEHIND IT WAS: I AM PRESENTING YOU WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE FANTASY BECAUSE, IN REAL LIFE, I CLING TO THE CONVENTIONAL COMFORTS OF THE WORLD. THAT CANNOT BE SAID OF YOU. SINCE I STARTED DESIGNING, EVERYTHING I DESIGN, AND PRODUCE IS INTENDED FOR EVERYDAY USE. YOU CAN ALSO DESIGN EXTREME FASHION TO FIT INTO EVERYDAY LIFE - THROUGH CERTAIN MATERIALS, JUST THROUGH WEARING AND THE PATINA THAT COMES WITH IT. I WANTED TO CORRUPT EVERYDAY LIFE, TO HAVE SOME FANTASY AND MAGIC IN EVERYDAY LIFE. &quot;DIRTY HABITS, THAT&#39;S WHAT MY CLOTHES ARE ABOUT,&quot; IS HOW YOU SUMMED UP YOUR CREDO 25 YEARS AGO. THAT&#39;S STILL TRUE, BUT NOT QUITE ANYMORE. I GREW UP IN THE SMALL TOWN OF PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, WITH FEAR AND SHAME BECAUSE OF MY PERSONAL EXTRAVAGANCE. MY CAREER IS MY WAY OF MOCKING SHAME AND DISCRIMINATION. WHEN I WEAR PLATFORM BOOTS AT THE AIRPORT, I DON&#39;T DO IT TO LOOK HOT. I DO IT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THEIR IDEALS OF BEAUTY ARE VERY LIMITED. I REMIND YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, EVEN WHAT I LIVE. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR IDEA OF BEAUTY? I PUSH BOUNDARIES, BUT I ALSO CELEBRATE CLASSICAL BEAUTY. MUCH OF MY FASHION IS BASED ON ANCIENT GREEK DRAPING, BIBLICAL ROBES, AND CLERICAL GARMENTS. I AM VERY MUCH ROOTED IN THE 1930S AND LOVE ART DECO DRESSES. I JUST CHOOSE MY FAVORITE THINGS FROM EACH ERA. WHAT IS YOUR LATEST DISCOVERY? TURKISH-BORN ARTIST SISSY MISFIT. SHE IS PART OF A NEW TRANSGENDER TECHNO-PUNK ROCK SCENE. HER MUSIC IS SO POWERFUL, HER LOOK AND HER STAGE PRESENCE ARE SO STRONG! I HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED THE TRANS COMMUNITY. WHEN I WAS PART OF THE LOS ANGELES TRANS SCENE 30 YEARS AGO, NOBODY CARED ABOUT PRONOUNS. IT WAS MUCH MORE CHAOTIC. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY THE DESIRE TO BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WHY? BECAUSE I HAD TO. I WANTED TO BE SOMEONE ELSE TO GET WHERE I WANTED TO GO. I OFTEN WONDERED WHY GAY MEN WERE INTERESTED IN DIVAS. WHY WOMEN LIKE JOAN CRAWFORD IN OLD FILMS? FOR YOUNG GAY MEN, THIS CAN BE VERY IDENTITY-FORMING BECAUSE THEIR FEMININITY IS A HANDICAP IN A MAN&#39;S WORLD. IT&#39;S ABOUT BEING STRONG, DESPITE YOUR OWN FEMININITY, WHICH IS CONSIDERED UNACCEPTABLE. HOW FEMININE DO YOU FEEL IN YOURSELF? YOU LOOK QUITE MASCULINE. THAT&#39;S BECAUSE I&#39;VE TRANSFORMED MYSELF. BUT I USED TO BE A VERY SENSITIVE, FRAGILE LITTLE BOY. I DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY COUSINS OR OTHER CHILDREN IN MY LIFE. I WAS VERY CLOSE TO MY PARENTS IN A VERY SMALL TOWN. I DIDN&#39;T LEARN TO BE PART OF A GROUP. WHEN I WAS EXPOSED TO OTHERS AT SCHOOL, I WAS COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED. I HAD TO LEARN TO PROTECT MYSELF. IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, I WAS VERY AFRAID TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF. EVEN AS A TEENAGER, I WAS AFRAID TO SHOWER WITH THE OTHERS AFTER GYM CLASS. NUDITY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT FULL OF TESTOSTERONE MADE ME NERVOUS, PROBABLY BECAUSE IT POSED AN EROTIC THREAT TO ME. DID YOU KNOW BACK THEN THAT YOU WERE NOT HETEROSEXUAL? OH YES! AND I WAS BULLIED. MY PARENTS DIDN&#39;T KNOW THAT, OR THEY DID, BUT THEY DIDN&#39;T TALK ABOUT IT. MY CHILDHOOD WAS MISERABLE. MY HOMETOWN, WHICH I AVOIDED FOR A LONG TIME AS AN ADULT, WAS AN AGRICULTURAL TOWN FULL OF COWBOYS AND MEXICANS. FULL OF HOSTILITY TOWARDS ME. MY FATHER WAS EXTREMELY HOMOPHOBIC. I WASN&#39;T REALLY PUNISHED FOR MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION, BUT HE EXPOSED ME. WE ALSO HAD CONFLICTS LATER ON WHEN I LIVED OUT MY SEXUALITY VERY OPENLY AS AN ADULT. AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, I STARTED BODYBUILDING. I TOOK STEROIDS AND TURNED MYSELF INTO SOMEONE WHO FELT COMPLETELY AT HOME IN THE LOCKER ROOM. AND IT WORKED NOT ONLY IN THE LOCKER ROOM BUT ALSO IN SEX CLUBS FULL OF NAKED MEN. ACTUALLY, IN ALL-MALE ENVIRONMENTS WHERE EROTICISM PLAYS THE MAIN ROLE. WHAT WAS ONCE FEAR WAS NOW TOTAL SOVEREIGNTY. WHAT DID YOU LOOK LIKE THEN? I WORE DR. MARTEN BOOTS, BLACK WORK TROUSERS THAT I WORE BACKWARDS SO THE POCKETS FLAPPED AROUND, BLACK UNDERSHIRTS WITH BLACK SUSPENDERS ON TOP, BLACK GLOVES, A ROSARY AROUND MY NECK. A CHAIN HUNG FROM MY EAR TO MY NOSE RING. ON TOP, A MOHAWK MADE OF BLEACHED HAIR. I WORE A LOT OF CHANEL MAKE-UP, A LOT OF WHITE POWDER. I LOOKED LIKE A KABUKI ACTRESS. WHAT WERE YOUR DREAMS AFTER SCHOOL IN THE MID-1980S? I MOVED TO LOS ANGELES TO GO TO ART SCHOOL BUT DROPPED OUT AFTER A YEAR BECAUSE I FOUND IT TOO INTELLECTUALLY DEMANDING. BUT I DID HAVE A TALENT FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORK AND WAS PRETTY GOOD AT MAKING PATTERNS. I BECAME A PATTERN MAKER FOR A FABRIC MANUFACTURER AND MADE GOOD MONEY, WHICH I USED TO BUY ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AND GO OUT EVERY NIGHT. WHILE GOING OUT, I MET MICHÈLE LAMY, WHO GAVE ME A JOB AT HER FASHION LABEL. WAS THAT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR LOVE FOR MICHÈLE LAMY, A FLAMBOYANT DANCER FROM PARIS AND ICON OF HOLLYWOOD NIGHTLIFE, WHO WAS 17 YEARS OLDER THAN YOU? NO, I WAS JUST GOOD AT WHAT I DID. I HAD A STYLE THAT SHE THOUGHT WOULD SUIT HER LABEL. AT THE TIME, SHE WAS ALREADY RUNNING LE DEUX CAFÉS, WHICH BECAME A CABARET-LIKE NIGHTLIFE SPOT IN HOLLYWOOD. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO IT FULL-TIME, SHE GAVE UP HER LABEL. AFTER A FEW YEARS, WE FELL IN LOVE. WHAT IS THE SECRET OF THEIR 30-YEAR RELATIONSHIP? WE BOTH NEEDED OUR OPPOSITES IN OUR LIVES. I WAS ATTRACTED TO MICHÈLE BECAUSE SHE IS ELEGANT AND BARBARIC AT THE SAME TIME. I NEEDED MORE LOOSENESS. SHE NEEDED TO BE GROUNDED. SHE PREFERS TO RUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND NEVER GET ANYWHERE, I GO STRAIGHT FROM A TO B. HOW WOULD YOU RATE YOUR WIFE&#39;S INFLUENCE ON YOUR CAREER? I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE WHOSE TASTE I TRUST MORE. HER AESTHETIC IS SOPHISTICATED, BRUTAL, AND RAW AT THE SAME TIME. SHE MAKES MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES TANGIBLE. TOGETHER WE ARE UNBEATABLE. I GREW UP IN HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WANTED TO MAKE IT BIG. SHE GREW UP IN UPPER-CLASS SPLENDOR AND WANTED TO LEAD A SIMPLE LIFE. THAT IS WHAT MAKES UP OUR CHEMISTRY TO THIS DAY. SUCCESSFUL LABELS OFTEN ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF LARGE COMPANIES. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TEMPTED TO SELL? OH YES. ONCE SOMEONE WANTED TO TAKE OVER MY COMPANY AND BUY MY RIGHTS, I THOUGHT THAT OPPORTUNITY WOULD NEVER COME AGAIN. BUT THEN, MY PARTNERS WANTED ME TO EXPAND. AND THAT&#39;S WHAT WE DID. WE WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN WE EVER DREAMED. I WOULD NEVER SELL AGAIN. WHAT BOTHERS YOU MOST ABOUT TODAY&#39;S FASHION INDUSTRY, WHICH IS FIRMLY IN THE HANDS OF A FEW CORPORATIONS? NOTHING. I&#39;M NOT ONE OF THEM. AND THE MORE IT GOES IN THAT DIRECTION, THE MORE UNIQUE I AM. ACCORDING TO YOURSELF, YOU HAD A FULL-BLOWN DRINKING PROBLEM AT THE END OF THE 1990S. WHAT SAVED YOU? FEAR. I GOT TO A POINT WHERE I WAS AFRAID I WAS GOING TO DIE OF ALCOHOLISM. I HAD TO QUIT THREE OR FOUR TIMES BECAUSE IT DIDN&#39;T WORK AT FIRST. I WAS VERY FRUSTRATED AT THE TIME. I WAS AFRAID OF NOT BEING RECOGNIZED. IT TOOK A LOT OF AGGRESSION AND AMBITION TO FIGHT FOR RECOGNITION. AND FOR THAT, I NEEDED ALCOHOL. HOW COULD YOU FUNCTION AS A DRINKER? IT&#39;S FINE WHEN YOU&#39;RE IN YOUR THIRTIES. BUT NOT AFTER THAT. I ALSO HAD A MELANCHOLIC, SELF-DESTRUCTIVE SIDE: SOMETIMES, I WOULD GET DRUNK FOR THREE DAYS UNTIL I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. BECAUSE I WAS STRESSED, BECAUSE I WAS SCARED, AND JUST WANTED TO DISAPPEAR. IT WAS A KIND OF TEMPORARY SUICIDE. BUT THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED: SUCCESS CAME, AND I GOT OUT OF IT. I STILL HAVE ALCOHOL IN THE HOUSE TODAY. I THINK DRINKING IS GREAT. IT JUST DIDN&#39;T WORK FOR ME. WHAT ARE YOUR DRUGS OF CHOICE TODAY? CIGARETTES AND SUGAR. I LIKE TO SMOKE BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP, IT PUTS ME IN THAT PEACEFUL SLEEP MODE. I EAT A LOT OF CAKE, BUT I ALSO EXERCISE A LOT. LIKE EVERY DAY. ARE YOU STILL TAKING STEROIDS? NO. BUT I WILL ASK MY DOCTOR ABOUT TESTOSTERONE. I LIKE BEING SKINNY, BUT I SHOULD HAVE MORE MUSCLE FOR TRAINING SO OFTEN. MAYBE IT&#39;S AGE? OR MAYBE I NEED TO CHANGE MY DIET. TESTOSTERONE IS SUSPECTED OF CAUSING HAIR LOSS. REALLY? THERE IS ALWAYS SOME PROBLEM. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON COSMETIC SURGERY OR BOTOX? EVERYONE SHOULD DO WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY. I THINK IT&#39;S HARSH THAT 20-YEAR-OLDS ARE ALREADY DOING IT TODAY. BUT MAYBE IT&#39;S THE DUTY OF EVERY GENERATION TO OFFEND THE PREVIOUS GENERATION. WE GOT TATTOOS TO SCARE OUR PARENTS. TODAY&#39;S KIDS JUST GET THEIR FACES OPERATED ON. MY HAIR IS FAKE, MY TEETH TOO. THE HAIR? IT&#39;S MINE, BUT IT WOULD BE WHITE AND FRIZZY. I HAVE IT DYED AND STRAIGHTENED. I&#39;LL EVEN DYE MY SCALP. THERE&#39;S A SHORT FILM ON YOUTUBE WITH YOU IN WHICH YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SEX WITH A HORSE. YES! AND WE BOTH END UP BEING CUT UP WITH A CHAINSAW. IT&#39;S NOT A SPLATTER VIDEO, IT&#39;S INFLUENCED BY KABUKI THEATER. WHERE DOES THIS NEVER-ENDING DESIRE FOR PROVOCATION COME FROM? CONFRONTATION WITH SHAME AND FEAR! I MAKE FUN OF CONVENTIONAL STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR, OF SEXUAL INTOLERANCE. HOW IMPORTANT IS HUMOR TO YOU? VERY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NOTHING MORE ELEGANT IN THE WORLD THAN HUMOR, THAN SOMEONE WHO CAN LAUGH AT THEMSELVES. WE SHOULDN&#39;T TAKE EVERYTHING SO SERIOUSLY. WHAT IS THE LEAST ECCENTRIC THING ABOUT YOU? I&#39;M VERY AVERAGE! I WORK A LITTLE, TAKE A NAP, WORK OUT, EAT LUNCH, GO FOR A WALK WITH MY WIFE, AND WATCH TV. AND I DO THAT EVERY DAY. OH, AND I&#39;VE RECENTLY STARTED GOING TO CHURCH. I DON&#39;T GO TO MASS; I&#39;M NOT REALLY CATHOLIC, BUT CHURCHES ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN CHURCH? MY PARENTS CAME TO EVERY ONE OF MY FASHION SHOWS IN PARIS, AND THEN I WENT TO CHURCH WITH THEM. MY MOTHER PRAYED, AND MY FATHER AND I JUST SAT THERE. SHE BLESSED US BOTH. AND THEN THEY TALKED ABOUT WHO WANTED TO BE BURIED. NOW BOTH OF THEM HAVE PASSED, AND I GO TO CHURCH ALONE. SO, IT&#39;S ALSO A VISIT TO MY PARENTS. I VALUE THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN SOCIETY. IT&#39;S A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE CREATED TO BE NICE TO EACH OTHER. I DON&#39;T BELIEVE IN GOD, BUT I DO BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF GOOD. YOU WANTED YOUR CURRENT MEN&#39;S COLLECTION TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A REACTION TO &quot;SOME OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING HUMAN BEHAVIOR WE WILL EXPERIENCE IN OUR TIME.&quot; FASHION AS A COMMENTARY ON WAR AND CRISES? I PRESENT CLOTHING THAT IS SO EXAGGERATED THAT IT FEELS LIKE A PROTEST. WHEN THE NAZIS OCCUPIED FRANCE, THAT FASHION IN PARIS WAS PARTICULARLY EXALTED, ALMOST RIDICULOUS. A REACTION TO THE OCCUPATION, A FORM OF PROTEST. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WELL: PRESENTING SOMETHING RIDICULOUS IN TIMES OF GREAT UNEASE.

MY VERY FIRST JOB THAT I GOT PAID FOR WAS WORKING SHIFTS AT TACO BELL, BACK IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA. AND YOU DON’T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT. I WAS GOING NOWHERE MUCH. MY PARENTS WERE WORRIED, SO MY MOM DROVE ME TO LA TO GO TO ART SCHOOL. I DROPPED OUT. I WAS REALLY INTIMIDATED BY ALL THE CLASSES, IN THEORY, WHICH I NOW KNOW TO BE BULLSHIT. PLUS, I COULDN’T REALLY AFFORD IT. INSTEAD I DID A PATTERN-MAKING COURSE AT TRADE SCHOOL. DAD HAD ALWAYS SAID I SHOULD LEARN A SKILL. THIS GOT ME WORK AT A SMALL STUDIO CALLED THE LA DESIGN GROUP. AND I DID THAT FOR AROUND TWO YEARS, WORKING WITH THIS WONDERFUL SAMPLE MAKER: RICARDO WAS GRUFF, A LITTLE CRANKY, SILENT AND ALSO THE MOST EXQUISITE SEWER. EVENTUALLY I EARNED HIS RESPECT. BUT THIS IS ALL TO PREFACE WHAT I’M COUNTING AS MY REAL FIRST JOB: THE GIG THAT LED TO WHAT BECAME RICK OWENS. AND THAT JOB WAS WORKING FOR MICHÈLE. THERE’S A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE SOMEONE FOUND OF ME ON MTV AT AROUND THIS TIME, IN 1988. LOOKING AT IT NOW, OF COURSE, I CRINGE. BUT OBJECTIVELY IT’S AN INTERESTING TIME CAPSULE. I’M INCREDIBLY COCKY. AND YOU KNOW, I JUST DON’T REMEMBER HAVING THAT CONFIDENCE — A CONFIDENCE BORDERING ON ARROGANCE. AND I DON’T THINK I WAS HIGH, ALTHOUGH I MIGHT HAVE HAD A COCKTAIL OR SOMETHING. I THINK I WAS JUST PERFORMING, FRANTICALLY PERFORMING, OVERCOMPENSATING FOR BEING SHY. AND I WONDER IF THAT’S WHAT I WAS LIKE WHEN I FIRST MET HER. IT HAPPENED THROUGH RICK CASTRO, THE FETISH PHOTOGRAPHER. ONE DAY HE SAID TO ME, “I’M GONNA DO A MENSWEAR COLLECTION FOR MICHÈLE LAMY. SO DO YOU WANT TO CUT THE PATTERNS, FREELANCE?” I SAID SURE. I KNEW OF MICHÈLE ALREADY, KIND OF; I WOULD HAVE MET HER IN THE CLUBS A COUPLE OF TIMES. WE MOVED IN DIFFERENT CIRCLES BUT DRAG IS WHERE WE WOULD HAVE INTERSECTED. BECAUSE MICHÈLE HAD GAINED OUR RESPECT BY HAVING A SHOW AT THE PLAZA, WHICH WAS THIS DRAG CLUB FREQUENTED BY MEXICANS, USING THE GIRLS THAT WORK THERE. IT WAS GREAT. SHE WAS DOING CLOTHES THAT WERE LIKE A CALIFORNIA SPORTSWEAR VERSION OF ZORAN. THEY WERE EXUBERANT. ANYWAY, RICK CASTRO. HE WAS WORKING WITH HIS PARTNER MICHI TOMIMATSU. THEY WERE STYLISTS AND THEY MADE THESE WEIRD LITTLE HATS — THE NAME OF THEIR COMPANY WAS I LOVE RICKY — AND MICHÈLE BOUGHT THE HATS FOR HER STORE, WHICH IS HOW THEY’D WORKED TOGETHER UNTIL THIS MENSWEAR IDEA CAME ABOUT. HE TOOK ME TO HER STUDIO ON TRACTION AVENUE, DOWNTOWN LA, AND THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME I MET HER. IT WAS IN THIS BIG LOFT SPACE AND I WAS WEARING THE CLOTHES, TRYING THEM ON FOR HER. SHE WAS SITTING UNDER THE SKYLIGHT SURROUNDED BY ALL THESE CUTTING TABLES, AND IT WAS ALL VERY PRETTY. RICK’S CONCEPT FOR THE COLLECTION AT THE TIME WAS KIND OF ALAÏA FOR MEN. SO EVERYTHING WAS SUPER TIGHT, AND IT WAS A JOCKSTRAP; IT WAS THESE LEGGINGS THAT HAD SEAMS ON THE ASS, AND IT WAS A TANK TOP. THEY WERE ALL IN LYCRA COTTONS IN THESE SUBDUED COLOURS — ARMY GREEN AND BLACK. IT WAS EXTREME AND QUITE CONTEMPORARY. I GUESS SHE LIKED IT, BECAUSE WE KEPT DOING IT. AND EVENTUALLY, MICHÈLE OFFERED TO HIRE US FULL-TIME. BEFORE THAT, I HAD TO GO TO WHAT I GUESS WAS AN INTERVIEW, BECAUSE I STILL DIDN’T REALLY KNOW HER THEN. IT WAS IN THIS TEA HOUSE IN LITTLE TOKYO. SHE ALWAYS SAYS I HAD A REALLY GOOD LOOK. IT WAS PROBABLY NAIL POLISH, EYE MAKEUP AND MY REALLY BIG, CHUNKY NOSE RING. AND I WORE A DURAG IN THOSE DAYS. IT WAS MADE OUT OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BROWN SILK-JERSEY THAT I’D PICKED UP AT A REMNANT SHOP, THIS MAGIC LITTLE SHOP — I’VE NEVER SEEN SILK-JERSEY LIKE IT SINCE. I DON’T REMEMBER HER BEING THAT CHATTY. AND IF SHE WAS, I PROBABLY DIDN’T UNDERSTAND HER VERY WELL BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THEN FOR ME. I PROBABLY MUST HAVE DONE ALL OF THE TALKING. WHICH IS WHAT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT THAT YOUTUBE VIDEO, WHERE I WAS REALLY PUTTING ON A SHOW. SO THERE WAS THIS PERIOD AT THE BEGINNING WHERE RICK CASTRO WAS THE DESIGNER FOR LAMY MEN AND HE WAS TAKING ALL THE CREDIT, WHICH MAKES COMPLETE SENSE. THE FIRST TIME SHE PRESENTED IN NEW YORK, RICK WENT AND I DIDN’T. WWD WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT SHOW. THEY WERE VERY MUCH CLUTCHING THEIR PEARLS ABOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT TONY WARD IN A SILVER LAMÉ JOCKSTRAP AT A MORNING SHOW. AND THERE IS A GREAT VIDEO DIRECTED BY MICHÈLE’S HUSBAND AT THE TIME, RICHARD NEWTON, OF THE MEN’S COLLECTION. IT’S LIKE A MILITARY RECRUITMENT: ALL THESE GUYS GETTING THEIR HEADS SHAVED, SHOWERING, GETTING INOCULATED, PUTTING ON THESE JOCKSTRAPS, ALL TO A LAIBACH SOUNDTRACK. RICK CASTRO, MICHI AND I WORKED IN A MEZZANINE OVER THE SHIPPING AREA IN THE WAREHOUSE THAT USUALLY HAD A GARAGE DOOR OPENED ONTO THE STREET. SINCE MOST OF THE SHIPPING CREW WERE YOUNG ARTISTS FROM THE AREA, WE HAD A HUGE SOUND SYSTEM BLASTING KISS AND HOUSE MUSIC MIXES ALL DAY. BACK THEN, WE STILL USED HAND-CUT CARDBOARD PATTERNS THAT WERE HAND-TRACED ONTO LAYERS OF FABRICS SPREAD BY THE CUTTERS. NOW, THE PATTERNS ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMMED AND PRINTED OUT, OF COURSE. DURING THAT TIME THERE WAS FRICTION BETWEEN ME AND RICK. I WAS GOING TO QUIT. I DON’T REMEMBER IF I QUITE SAID “IT’S HIM OR ME,” BUT MAYBE I DID. SO HE LEFT, AND WE DIDN’T SPEAK FOR YEARS. IN THE END IT BECAME QUITE FUN BEING ARCH-ENEMIES. EVERYBODY CALLED US ‘GOOD RICK’ AND ‘BAD RICK’. IT WAS AN AMUSING RIVALRY. AFTER RICK LEFT, MICHI STAYED, AND AS WELL AS WORKING ON THE MEN’S COLLECTION WHILE IT LASTED, I WORKED WITH HER. I DO LOOK BACK VERY FONDLY ON IT THIS TIME. I REMEMBER BEFORE I MOVED INTO MICHÈLE’S HOUSE ON HANCOCK PARK THERE WAS THIS VERY GLAMOROUS PERIOD WHEN I WAS LIVING ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. BECAUSE I WAS WORKING I COULD AFFORD THIS TINY, JUST EXQUISITE APARTMENT IN ONE OF THOSE OLD MEDITERRANEAN-STYLE PALAZZO BUILDINGS THAT WAS KIND OF FALLING APART. IT WAS REALLY PRETTY. AND ALL OF THE BARS WERE THERE; THERE WERE LIKE FIVE GAY BARS WITHIN WALKING RADIUS. SO WE WOULD JUST GO ON DRINKING TOURS. THERE WAS THE FIREFLY, THERE WAS THE SPOTLIGHT, THERE WAS THE BLACKLIGHT. AND THERE WAS THE HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL THAT HAD THE LOUNGE UNDERNEATH IT. I VIVIDLY RECALL GOING TO SEE NINA SIMONE PERFORM THERE ONE NIGHT. I WAS WALKING BY MYSELF DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD WEARING MY PLATFORMS AND MY MAKEUP. I HAD A LONG, BLACK VELVET CAPE. I WAS INSUFFERABLE. AND I REMEMBER THIS DRUNK HOMELESS GUY SUDDENLY LURCHING OUT OF THE DOORWAY AS I WAS PASSING. HE GOES: “YOU’VE GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN FRONT OF YOU.” I WALKED BY, FLICKING MY CIGARETTE. ONE HALLOWEEN, AFTER ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ME WORKING THERE, MICHÈLE AND I BECAME FRIENDS. I REMEMBER HELPING HER DO HER HAIR AND THEN GOING OUT AND DANCING. SUDDENLY IT WAS COMFORTABLE FOR US TO HANG OUT. IT WASN’T ROMANTIC AT THE BEGINNING. ALTHOUGH SHE WAS ALWAYS VERY VIXENY. SHE ALWAYS WORE LEGGINGS WITH SOME KIND OF LOOSE TOP AND THEN A WEIRD HAT AND A LOT OF JEWELLERY. SHE WAS WILDLY ATTRACTIVE. I WAS DEFINITELY CHECKING OUT HER FIGURE. THEN, WE CAME TO PARIS FOR SOMETHING BUSINESS RELATED. AND AT ONE POINT I GOT REALLY DRUNK, AND I JUMPED HER. THAT TRIED-AND-TESTED METHOD OF SEDUCTION. THE JUMP OCCURRED IN PARIS, THEN THINGS PROCEEDED BACK IN LOS ANGELES. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME IT WAS APPARENT AT THE FACTORY THAT SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN US. EVERYBODY COULD TELL FROM THE WAY WE WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER. LATER, SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT OUR PRESS GUY, BRIAN WATSON, SAID: “OH MY GOD — THERE’S THE END OF THE COMPANY.” THERE WERE OTHER CHANGES HAPPENING. THE COMPANY WAS IN A POSITION WHERE IT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO START MANUFACTURING SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN LA, AND CHANGE PRICING AND DISTRIBUTION, AND DO A LOT MORE IN ORDER TO GET TO ANOTHER LEVEL. SO MICHÈLE WAS LOOKING FOR PARTNERS AND BACKERS, AND SHE HAD SOME WHO DIDN’T WORK OUT. AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE HAD TAKEN OVER CAFÉ DES ARTISTES FROM A FRENCH FRIEND OF HERS. SHE GOT INTO THAT AND SHE REALLY MADE IT A SUCCESS. AND SHE STARTED TURNING OVER MORE OF THE DESIGN BUSINESS. SHE HAD AN ASSISTANT NAMED LING LING WHO WAS CREATING THE BREAD-AND-BUTTER PIECES THAT MADE EVERYTHING FLOW. I WAS MAKING WEIRD AND WONDERFUL AND FUN STUFF THAT DIDN’T MAKE ANY MONEY. IN FACT, I WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. MICHÈLE GRAVITATED MORE TOWARDS THE CAFÉ LIFE, AND THEN THAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN, TOOK ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN AND BECAME THIS BIG SCENE. AND IT CAME TO THE POINT WHERE SHE JUST THREW HER HANDS UP ABOUT THE FASHION BUSINESS, AND THREW HERSELF INTO THE CAFÉ. SHE SHUTTERED THE COMPANY. AND THAT WAS IT. I DIDN’T HAVE A JOB ANYMORE. SO WE STOPPED. AND THEN I STARTED DOING MY OWN COLLECTIONS. AND BRIAN WATSON WAS RIGHT! I THINK EVERYONE ASSUMES MICHÈLE INVESTED AT THE BEGINNING, BUT NEITHER OF US HAD ANY MONEY TO SPARE. HERS HAD ALL GONE INTO THE FASHION BUSINESS AND THE CAFÉ — AND THEN HER RESTAURANT. IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE TRANSITION. THAT RESTAURANT WAS LEGENDARY, AND IT WAS FABULOUS. BUT IT WAS ALSO A HUGE INVESTMENT, AND IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HARD TO MAKE THAT BACK. SHE WAS GOING TO BE STUCK TO IT FOREVER. MEANWHILE, I WAS MAKING STUFF MYSELF. I TOOK IT TO THE BEST STORE THAT I COULD FIND AT THE TIME, AND I GOT 50 PER CENT DOWN PAYMENT FROM HIM ON THE ORDER AND ANOTHER 50 PER CENT UPON DELIVERY. THAT’S HOW I SURVIVED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AT THE BEGINNING. AFTERWARDS, WHEN I GOT A DISTRIBUTION DEAL IN EUROPE, MICHÈLE CAME WITH ME. AND THAT WAS IT: WE JUST LEFT. WE LANDED IN PARIS.

HE LATER MET MY MOTHER IN MEXICO AND BROUGHT HER TO CALIFORNIA TO MARRY HER. BY THE TIME I ARRIVED, HE WAS WORKING AS A SOCIAL WORKER IN A SMALL CONSERVATIVE TOWN, DETERMINING WHETHER PEOPLE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL BENEFITS, WHICH I BELIEVE ENDED UP MAKING HIM CYNICAL, MISTRUSTFUL, AND SOMEWHAT BITTER. THE FATHER I KNEW WAS RACIST, BIGOTED, AND SMUGLY JUDGEMENTAL. HE DID WANT TO HELP PEOPLE, BUT ONLY ON HIS STRICT TERMS. BUT AT THE BACK OF HIS CLOSET WAS A WEATHERED WOODEN TRUNK, BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS TIME IN JAPAN, THAT WAS LIKE HIS SECRET SOFT SPOT. IT CONTAINED PADDED, SOFTLY COLORED SILK KIMONOS HELD TOGETHER WITH INTRICATELY BRAIDED CORDS; SANDALWOOD INCENSE; AND SHANGTUNG-BOUND ALBUMS CONTAINING PHOTOS OF MY FATHER AS A PLEASURE-SEEKING YOUNG MAN IN ARMY UNIFORM WITH HIS BUDDIES AT WORK OR PLAY. THERE WERE ALSO PHOTOS OF MY FATHER DRESSING IN A TRADITIONAL KIMONO ALONGSIDE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE GIRLS, ALSO IN KIMONOS, WALKING THROUGH A GARDEN UNDER AN UMBRELLA OR STANDING ON A BRIDGE UNDER FALLING BLOSSOMS. IT WAS HARD TO IMAGINE THE FATHER WHO SNEERED AT MY SISSY FLIGHTS OF FANTASY INDULGING IN SOME GLAMOROUS EXOTICISM OF HIS OWN. AMONG HIS PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY BOOKS IN HIS BASEMENT LIBRARY WERE OLD BOOKS OF JAPANESE WATERCOLOR LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS, WHICH WERE SUCH A DEPARTURE FROM THE PEDANTIC, MORALLY SUPERIOR CHARACTER I WAS USED TO. THESE WATERCOLORS WERE ALL ABOUT DREAMY, ABSTRACT AMBIGUITY, AS WELL AS A TOLERANT POINT OF VIEW THAT SEEMED AT ODDS WITH THE MAN I KNEW. AS THE MAIN SUBJECT OF HIS JUDGEMENT, I ENDED UP JUDGING HIS JUDGEMENT WITH SOME PRETTY HARSH JUDGEMENTS OF MY OWN. I AM ALWAYS A BIT CONSCIOUS OF MY OWN TENDENCY TOWARD DISAPPROVAL AND PERHAPS OVER-CORRECT MYSELF BY AVOIDING STRONG OPINIONS AND ALWAYS TRYING TO GIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. I SENSE MY FATHER&#39;S NEED FOR ORDER AND CONTROL IN MY OWN CHARACTER, WHICH DECENDS DIRECTLY FROM HIS. BUT I ALSO THANK HIM FOR INSTILLING POETRY AND MYSTERY IN MY LIFE – IN THE REASSURANCE OF A DREAMY WATERCOLOR, CENTURIES OLD, OF WHAT MIGHT BE A MISTY MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE, OPEN TO INTERPRETATION… Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

THAT’S JUST NOT SOMETHING WE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT IN PORTERVILLE. REREADING IT NOW, AS AN ADULT, COMPARING IT TO WHAT IT MEANT TO ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I THOUGHT, OH GOD, I TOTALLY GET THIS. THIS WAS GIVING ME AN EXCUSE TO BE ISOLATED AND SOLITARY AND MOODY AND TO COMPLETELY INDULGE IN MY SENSES. THIS WAS MY EXCUSE AND THAT WAS WHY I WAS RELATING TO IT SO MUCH. JUST THE RAPTURE OF IT, THE INDULGENCE IN BEAUTY, WALLOWING LIKE A PIG IN IT — THAT WAS WHAT WAS SO COMPELLING ABOUT IT. “AND IT’S STILL COMPELLING. IT’S STILL FUN. IT’S SO DENSE AND ARCHAIC. ALSO LIKE, WOW, HOW DID I GET HERE? HOW DID I GET FROM READING THIS BOOK IN MY DAD’S BASEMENT LIBRARY? THE WHOLE REASON I EVER READ À REBOURS WAS BECAUSE MY DAD HAD THIS BIG LIBRARY. HE WAS VERY LITERARY. HE READ A LOT OF PHILOSOPHY, THEOLOGY, ALL OF THAT STUFF THAT WAS SUCH A TURN-OFF FOR ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG. BUT DOWN IN THE BASEMENT HE HAD THE BOOKS HE’D DISCARDED, THAT HE’D KEPT BUT WEREN’T HIS PRIORITY. AND THAT’S WHERE I FOUND À REBOURS. I ALSO FOUND PROUST — I SKIMMED IT FOR THE DIRTY PARTS. I DON’T KNOW HOW I EVEN KNEW THERE WERE DIRTY PARTS. I FOUND STÉPHANE MALLARMÉ, PIERRE LOTI, COLETTE. MY FATHER WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MAN. HE WAS AN INTELLECTUAL BULLY, A RACIST, A HOMOPHOBE. IN SOME WAYS WE WERE MORTAL ENEMIES, BUT THERE WAS ALSO A SWEETNESS, A STREAK OF GOLD, A CREATIVE SENSITIVITY THAT I BENEFITED FROM GREATLY, WHICH EXPOSED ME TO ART AND LITERATURE AND OPERA. IT WAS LIKE KARMA, BECAUSE HE WAS THE MAN WHO TURNED ME INTO THE QUEEN I AM NOW. SO, À REBOURS, IF IT’S SOMETHING THAT IS THE THREAD TO A RETROSPECTIVE THAT I AM HAVING AT THE AGE OF 63, THAT’S SOMETHING — THAT’S A BIG THING, I THINK.” RICK OWENS MOVED TO PARIS WITH HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY, MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO AND FAMOUSLY LIVES IN A SPECTACULAR 18TH-CENTURY TOWNHOUSE, FORMERLY THE OFFICES OF FRANÇOIS MITTERRAND, LOVINGLY RESTORED TO ITS ORIGINAL MAGNIFICENT PROPORTIONS AND REIMAGINED THROUGH OWENS’S BRUTALIST EYE. OVER THE PAST DECADE IN PARTICULAR, THE DESIGNER HAS BECOME THE CREATIVE BEHIND MANY OF THE MOST POWERFUL RUNWAY PRESENTATIONS IN HISTORY, TWO OF THEM HELD IN HIS HOME. HIS HIGHLY DISTINCTIVE, UNCOMPROMISING AESTHETIC HAS EARNED HIM AMONG THE MOST LOYAL FOLLOWINGS IN CONTEMPORARY FASHION. SPENDING THE MAJORITY OF HIS TIME BETWEEN VENICE — HIS COLLECTIONS ARE PRODUCED IN ITALY — AND THE FRENCH CAPITAL, OWENS SAYS NOW: “PARIS REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE THE PLACE WHERE I BELONG. MY HOUSE IN PARIS IS WHERE I FEEL THE MOST COMFORTABLE, THE MOST AT EASE.” PERHAPS WITH THAT IN MIND, HE IS TAKING FRENCH LESSONS FOR THE FIRST TIME. “I THOUGHT, WHAT DOES ONE DO FOR TRUE HAPPINESS AS ONE GETS OLDER? WELL, THE MOST PROFOUND THING TO DO IS TO LEARN THINGS. SO I THOUGHT, OK, I’M GETTING OLD IN PARIS, THIS IS MY SAFE PLACE, WHY DON’T I LEARN FRENCH?” WITH SAID RETROSPECTIVE OPENING IN JUNE, OWENS WILL RECORD THE AUDIO GUIDE — “IN ENGLISH BUT I’LL DO IT IN FRENCH TOO, IN MY AWKWARD AMERICAN FRENCH. I’LL BE LIKE, YOU GUYS GAVE ME A SHOW, I’LL DO THIS IN MY TERRIBLE FRENCH, IT’S THE POLITE THING TO DO.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

RICK OWENS FETCHES ME FROM DOWNSTAIRS, CALLING THROUGH HIS PALATIAL CONCRETE HOUSE, “DO I HAVE A DATE? OH, I DO!”, HIS VOICE HEIGHTENING AS HE TURNS THE CORNER TO FIND ME IN HIS DINING ROOM. IT’S THE ZILLIONTH TIME I’VE SEEN HIM, BUT WITH EACH TIME, HE LOOKS MORE AND MORE LIKE RICK OWENS—THE RICK OWENS HE DREAMED HIMSELF TO BE. A PLANAR FACE, BLACK HAIR LICKING AT HIS MIDDLE BACK, FEET HIDDEN IN GIANT GEOBASKETS, A LOW-CUT TANK WITH TATTOO SPIKES PIERCING FROM HIS WRIST UP HIS FOREARM. BECOMING THE PLATONIC IDEAL OF RICK OWENS HAS BEEN HIS LIFE’S WORK, A BILDUNGSROMAN THAT STITCHED TOGETHER A MAN, WHO, AT 63, IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HE WAS AT 23, MORE BRILLIANT THAN AT 33, AND WITH EACH PASSING DAY BECOMES SMARTER, TOUGHER, KINDER, AND MORE STRINGENTLY HIMSELF. OVER HIS SIX DECADES HE’S CHANGED A LOT ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT ON THE INSIDE, HE’S REMAINED A TENDERHEARTED OBSERVER, TAKING IN THE WORLD AND TRANSMUTING IT INTO HIS OWN SACRED LANGUAGE. “WHEN I WAS YOUNG, MY MOM REALLY LIKED PUTTING ME IN SHORT SUITS WITH KNEE SOCKS AND COMBING MY HAIR VERY …” HE GESTURES TO PART HIS MANE SLICK OVER ONE EYE, A TENDERNESS IN HIS VOICE AS HE REMEMBERS HIS MOTHER. “SHE WAS VERY MUCH PROUD OF HER LITTLE GENTLEMAN. SHE ALWAYS SAID THAT WITH HER HEAVY MEXICAN ACCENT.” THE MOST ENVIABLE QUALITY OF RICK OWENS IS THAT GENTLEMAN’S GENEROSITY. IT HAS PERSISTED IN HIM AT EVERY AGE, IN ANY OUTFIT. HE IS WARM AND GLAMOUROUS BUT NOT SHY, SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE TO HIM YOU ARE CAPTURED IN HIS SHINE. SITTING NEXT TO HIM, WATCHING HIM PUT HIS LONG, CALIFORNIAN SENTENCES TOGETHER, IS THE MOST MAGNETIC EXPERIENCE. HE COULD HAVE BEEN A POET, A PERFORMER, A PODCAST HOST, OR JUST A BIG PERSONALITY, BUT INSTEAD HE MAKES CLOTHING THAT CHANGES OUR MINDS. HE HAS DONE IT FOR 33-AND-COUNTING YEARS, CONVINCING PEOPLE OF THIGH-HIGH LEATHER PLATFORM BOOTS, SHOULDER PADS THAT HORN UPWARDS TOWARDS ONE’S EARS, FUZZY MINT DUST BALLS THAT TREMBLE AROUND THE BODY, AND CRUNCHED BALL GOWNS THAT PEEL OUT LIKE METAL JOHN CHAMBERLAIN SCULPTURES MADE FOR A RED CARPET. HE’S MADE FILMY UNDERPANTS AND STURDY OVERCOATS, LAYERS AND LAYERS OF BLACK JERSEY TEES, AND BOMBER JACKETS WHOSE “DRACUCOLLARS”—HIS TERM—CLOAK THE FACE. ONCE, HE MADE AN AQUAMARINE THONG SEQUIN BODYSUIT. ANOTHER TIME HE MADE A NEUTRAL LONG-SLEEVED CLOAK. THE ONLY THING PREDICTABLE ABOUT A RICK OWENS SHOW IS THAT IT WILL CHALLENGE YOUR CONCEPTIONS OF PROPORTION, APPROPRIATENESS, AND AESTHETICS. WE ARE NOW SITTING ON THE LOW COUCH OF HIS HOME’S SECOND-FLOOR STUDIO. CANDLES ARE LIT, THE MAKINGS OF HIS UPCOMING COLLECTIONS ARE IN MEDIA RES ALL AROUND US. IT’S SO PLAINLY BEAUTIFUL, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING. WHEN RICK OWENS SITS BESIDE YOU, YOU ARE FORCED TO CONFRONT THE YOU THAT YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IF ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS HADN’T GOTTEN IN THE WAY: THE EMAILS, GOOGLING “WHAT IS KHIA ASYLUM AND MY SHAYLA,” THE COMMENTS SECTION. HE LOOKS MILDLY OFFENDED WHEN I ASK HIM ABOUT NOT WANTING TO BE CHALLENGED (SOMETHING HE SAID OFFHAND ON A PODCAST), AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY: I’VE MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANT. HE MEANT THAT TO BE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE TO ELIMINATE EVERYTHING THAT DOES NOT YIELD FOR YOURSELF FROM THE EQUATION. “I HAVE MORE RAGE FOR WORK THAN EVER. SO IF THAT WAS INTERPRETED AS SAYING I’M TIRED, THAT WAS NOT IT AT ALL,” HE BEGINS, PICKING UP THE PACE OF HIS TALKING FROM CONSIDERATE TO SHARPENED. “OKAY, HERE’S AN EXAMPLE,” HE TURNS TO ME TO SPELL IT OUT. “AFTER THE ‘HOLLYWOOD’ SHOW, THE BIG WHITE SHOW AND EVERYTHING,” WHERE OVER 200 MODELS CAST FROM AROUND EUROPE NAVIGATED THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN A SERIES OF IVORY ENSEMBLES, CULMINATING WITH A PARADE FLOAT SUPPORTING FOUR BACKBENDING GYMNASTS. “THE NEXT DAY, MICHELE HAD GONE SOMEWHERE. NOBODY WAS IN THE HOUSE. IT WAS A FRIDAY AND NOBODY HAD LEFT ANY FOOD FOR ME. SO I’M IN MY BOXERS WANDERING AROUND THE HOUSE, LOOKING IN THE REFRIGERATOR, LOOKING FOR A CROISSANT OR SOMETHING, LIKE A PIECE OF BREAD I COULD TOAST. NOTHING.” HE GETS HIS ARMS INVOLVED TO MAKE THE IMAGE OF HIMSELF WANDERING THIS CONCRETE PALACE IN HOPES OF EVEN A CROUTON CLEAR. “I’M IN THE KITCHEN ON A STEP-LADDER, LOOKING AT THE SHELVES TO SEE IF ANYBODY LEFT ANY BREAD. I PUT ON SOME SHOES AND GO DOWN THE STREET. ALL CLOSED, EVERYTHING. I’M WANDERING AROUND LOOKING FOR BREAD.” HE PAUSES TO STARE ME DOWN THE BARREL. “I’M THINKING, I BET ARMANI HAS BREAD.” HIS EYEBROWS RAISE A LITTLE, I CAN’T TELL IF HE’S JOKING OR FURIOUS. “SO THAT’S WHAT I MEANT BY CHALLENGES.” THE WARM SMILE RETURNS. “THAT’S WHAT I MEANT BY CHALLENGES, AND THAT’S WHAT I MEAN BY SERENITY. I WANT TO HAVE BREAD.” SO NOW HE ALWAYS HAS BREAD IN THE HOUSE. TO AVOID THIS KIND OF LAZY MISINTERPRETATION FROM US REGULAR DEGULAR FASHION SCHLOCK JOCKS, OWENS HAS TO MAKE GRAND, SWEEPING, OBVIOUS, RATIONAL, AND EMOTIONALLY TRIUMPHANT ARGUMENTS FOR HIMSELF FOUR TIMES A YEAR ON THE RUNWAY. SOMETIMES, HE DOES IT IN BOOKS AND AT PARTIES SO WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING OURSELVES IN EVERY INCH OF OUR HUMAN BODIES AND ALL THE INCHES BEYOND THEM. OUR DUVET COVERS, OUR HOMES, OUR SPHYNX CATS NAMED PIXIE, OUR MIRRORED CABINETS THAT TOOK THREE YEARS TO INSTALL, EVERY BOOK WE OWN IN OUR LIBRARIES, EVERY SONG WE LISTEN TO, THE HOTEL OFF THE BEATEN PATH WE HAVE DINNER EVERY NIGHT WITH OUR BELOVED—IT ALL HAS TO BE OF ALL OF US, OTHER-WISE WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? THAT’S THE QUESTION TEMPLE OF LOVE ANSWERS, A FORTHCOMING RETROSPECTIVE THAT SWEEPS THROUGH PARIS’ PALAIS GALLIERA MUSEUM LIKE A BIBLICAL FLOOD. CHRONICLING RICK OWENS, THE MAN, THE JOURNEY, THE PRODUCTS, AND THE BRAND THROUGH THE COURSE OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE, FROM THE CHILDHOOD BOOKS HIS FATHER READ TO HIM TO HIS MOST RECENT FASHION SHOWS. THE EXHIBITION IS A SYMPHONY OF SHAPE AND TEXTURE, HAUNTING IN ITS SCALE WITH MORE THAN 100 PIECES BETWEEN CLOTHING, FURNITURE, AND SOME OTHER SALACIOUS LITTLE SURPRISES. MICHÈLE LAMY, HIS DAY ONE “HUN,” APPEARS LIKE A STATUE ON POSTERS THAT WILL PLASTER THE CITY. THE TEMPLE OF LOVE IS FOR ALL OF US, BUT IT IS MOSTLY FOR HER. GETTING THE POSTER APPROVED WAS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE, OWENS EXPLAINS, BECAUSE THE PARISIAN GOVERNMENT FUNDS THE MUSEUM AND WASN’T INITIALLY KEEN ON A PHOTO OF LAMY DRAPED IN WOOL, LOOKING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SCULPTURE AND SAINT. “I SENT THEM THIS LONG EMAIL SAYING THAT I WAS INSPIRED BY THIS STATUE [ON THE LEFT BANK] AND IT FOLLOWS IN THE LINE OF FRENCH CULTURE: JEAN COCTEAU, SAINT LAURENT, ALPHONSE MUCHA, POSTERS FOR SARAH BERNHARDT, TOULOUSE-LAUTREC”—HE’S SPEEDING THROUGH REFERENCE PICTURES ON HIS MACBOOK THAT HE EMAILED TO THE GOVERNMENT. “THEY FINALLY SAID YES.” JUST BEHIND US IN HIS OFFICE IS A WOODEN MODEL OF A STATUE WITH PEAKED SHOULDERS THAT WILL STAND IN THE GALLIERA’S ROTUNDA. THE FINAL ONES WILL BE 7 METRES TALL, ABOUT A DOZEN TOTAL, AND COVERED WITH MATTE BROWN SEQUINS. RIGHT NOW IT IS A 7-FOOT PLYWOOD SHELL. “YOU COULD FIT INSIDE,” HE JOKES, AND SO I CLIMB ON MY KNEES AND GET INSIDE. EVEN AT 5’8″ IN RICK OWENS KISS HEELS, I AM STILL SMALL BECAUSE I LET THOSE OTHER UN-RICK- LIKE THINGS GET TO ME. NOT ONLY DO I BUY MY OWN BREAD, I’VE MADE MARKETING DECKS, FOR GOD’S SAKE. THE STATUES, THE BOOKS, THE FEELINGS, THEY WILL OUTLIVE ME FOR SURE. I WILL BE FORGOTTEN, AND YOU, IF YOU DON’T CHANGE YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW, WILL BE FORGOTTEN, TOO, BUT RICK OWENS WILL NOT. HE WILL BE FOREVER, ALL OF THESE TOMBS HE’S MADE WHILE LIVING LIKE A KING, LIKE A PHARAOH, LIKE A GOD. “I’VE GOT IMMORTALITY,” HE SAYS MATTER-OF-FACTLY. “I’M ALREADY THERE. TO ASK FOR MORE WOULD BE A LOT. I’M CONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING I’VE GOTTEN AND HOW IT’S WAY MORE THAN I EVER DREAMED OF. I NEVER HAD THE IMAGINATION TO DREAM THAT BIG. I’M STILL CRANKY. I’M STILL PETTY, BUT I’M ALSO THINKING, ‘WOW, IF I DIE IN THE NEXT FIVE SECONDS, I WON.’” HIS GENTLEMANLY SMILE. “I SO WON.” IN 1987 RICK OWENS MET MICHÈLE LAMY. IT’S POSSIBLE THAT WITHOUT MICHÈLE LAMY, THERE WOULD BE NO RICK OWENS. SHE HAS BUOYED HIM TO NEW HEIGHTS AND MAY BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO CHALLENGES HIM, WHO AWES HIM, AND WHO CAN CHANGE HIS MIND. “MICHÈLE REALLY LOVES FLUX AND CONSTANT MOTION AND MOVEMENT,” SAYS OWENS, AND AS SUCH SHE BRINGS NEW CHARACTERS AND NEW IDEAS INTO THEIR LIVES. DURING MY VISIT AT THEIR HOUSE, SHE IS THE BOSS: SHE TELLS HIM THEIR SCHEDULE, THE FURNITURE THAT’S MOVING AROUND, THE OPERA THEY ARE SEEING LATER THAT EVENING, THAT PIXIE HAS “BUILT HER NEW HOME” BEHIND SOME CONSTRUCTION PANELS, AND AT THE SIGHT OF LITTLE PIXIE THEY BOTH AWW. WHEN WE STUMBLE ACROSS A PICTURE OF LAMY IN 2016, WALKING THROUGH SNOW IN A GIGANTIC OUTFIT OF OWENS’ MAKING, HE BECOMES LIKE A BOY IN LOVE. “IT IS SO CUTE, BECAUSE SHE REALLY DRESSES LIKE THAT,” HE LETS HIMSELF BE A LITTLE CHEEKY. “IT’S VERY, FROM RUNWAY TO REALITY.” LATELY, THEY HAVE BEEN WATCHING RERUNS OF HBO’S GETTING ON IN BED, A HOSPITAL COMEDY STARRING LAURIE METCALF, BUT LAMY GETS BORED OF SHOWS QUICKLY. THEY’LL FIND ANOTHER STREAMING COMEDY SOON. THE FIRST ORIGINAL CLOTHES RICK OWENS MADE, BEYOND HIS SCHOOL PROJECTS AND THINGS FOR HIMSELF TO WEAR, WERE FOR HER LABELS, FIRST LAMY MEN AND LATER SHI SHI. THEIR SUCCESS CONVINCED HIM TO STITCH HIS OWN NAME ON A TAG FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1992. OVER THE REST OF THE RIOTOUS 1990S, OWENS AND LAMY LINKED UP AS A COUPLE AND LIVED BETWEEN THE CHATEAU MARMONT, THE LAUREL HOTEL, AND FINALLY AT 1641 LAS PALMAS AVENUE, WHICH BECAME A WAREHOUSE, DESIGN STUDIO, HOME, STORE, AND HEADQUARTERS FOR LAMY’S FAMED HANGOUT-TURNED-RESTAURANT LES DEUX CAFES. IT’S WITH LAMY THAT RICK OWENS REALLY BECOMES MORE THAN A MAN: HE TURNS INTO A BRAND. RICK OWENS GARMENTS STARTED APPEARING IN FASHION EDITORIALS IN 2000. THAT YEAR, HE HOSTED A FASHION SHOW IN LOS ANGELES AND THEN ANOTHER WITH THE SUPPORT OF VOGUE AND STYLE.COM IN NEW YORK. IN 2001, HE INKED A DEAL WITH ELSA LANZO AND LUCA RUGGERI, TWO ITALIAN FASHION DISTRIBUTORS. TOGETHER THEY FOUND A FACTORY IN CONCORDIA, ITALY, TO PRODUCE COLLECTIONS. TWENTY-FOUR YEARS LATER, LANZO IS STILL THE CEO OF OWENSCORP, THEIR UMBRELLA COMPANY, AND RUGGERI IS STILL ITS COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR. OWENSCORP NOW OWNS THE FACTORY IN CONCORDIA. OWENS AND LAMY MOVED TO PARIS IN 2003 TO BE CLOSER TO THEIR PARTNERS AND THEIR FACTORIES, SETTING THEMSELVES UP IN THE PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON THE SAME WAY THEY DID ON LAS PALMAS: IT’S THEIR HOUSE, THEIR DESIGN STUDIO, THEIR PARTY PALACE, AND A CATHEDRAL WHERE PILGRIMS VISIT TO PRAY AT THE HEM OF HIS GARMENTS. STEFF YOTKA: DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU MET MICHELE? RICK OWENS:I PROBABLY MET HER AT A PARTY AT HER HOUSE. AT THAT TIME I WAS HANGING OUT WITH RICK CASTRO. HE’S A FETISH PHOTOGRAPHER NOW, BUT HE WAS A STYLIST THEN. AND I WAS HANGING WITH VAGINAL DAVIS AND GLEN MEADMORE, WHO WERE PERFORMING IN CLUBS, AND THEY WERE KIND OF DRAG BUT KIND OF PUNK. GLEN DID THIS WEIRD COWBOY DRAG WITH EYELASHES AND A BAD WIG AND A COWBOY SKIRT AND PANTS AND SANG COWBOY TECHNO-PUNK SONGS ABOUT “CORNHOLE ME” OR “PEEL IT BACK, GRANDPA.” SOUNDS AMAZING. GLEN IS LIKE 7 FEET TALL AND SUPER SKINNY. HE WAS ALSO MANIACAL. HE WOULD JUST THROW HIMSELF ALL OVER THE STAGE AND HE WOULD HURT HIMSELF. I MEAN, HE WAS JUST TOTALLY RECKLESS, WHICH WAS PART OF HIS CHARM. I REMEMBER IT WAS NEW YEAR’S EVE, AND I REMEMBER HE SQUATTED ON A BEER BOTTLE AND THEN HE GRIPPED IT WITH HIS ASS AND HE SANG HIS SONG WITH THE BEER BOTTLE UP HIS ASS. IT’S HARD TO HOLD A BEER BOTTLE LIKE THAT— —AND HOLD A MIC. RIGHT. HOLDING A LOT OF THINGS. ANYWAY, GLEN AND VAGINAL WERE PART OF MICHELE’S GROUP, TOO. I REMEMBER GLEN AND VAGINAL KIND OF STANDING ON PLATFORMS OR SOMETHING ON EACH SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE TO MICHELE’S HOUSE AND GOING IN, AND THAT WAS WHERE I MET HER. I HAVE A FEELING, BUT REMEMBER I WAS DRUNK THE ENTIRE TIME, SO MY MEMORY IS FROZEN. WAS IT LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT? IT WAS ATTRACTION. BUT EVERYBODY WAS, AND IS, ATTRACTED TO MICHELE AT FIRST SIGHT. SHE HAS SO MUCH MAGNETISM AND ALLURE. SHE WAS ALWAYS INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE TO ME, BUT THEN I STARTED NOTICING HER AFTERWARD, WHEN WE STARTED WORKING TOGETHER. SHE ALWAYS WORE LITTLE TIGHTS WITH A JACKET OR SOMETHING. RUNNING AROUND IN THE LITTLE TIGHTS, SHE WAS VERY CUTE. THE HAIR AND THE JEWELLERY AND EVERYTHING … AND THEN THE WAY SHE IS. WAS IT AROUND THIS MOMENT THAT YOU FELT THAT YOU SORT OF BECAME RICK OWENS? YOU SPOKE A LOT ABOUT THE TRANSITION BETWEEN “SMALL-TOWN SISSY” AND THE MORE REALISED VERSION OF YOURSELF. WHEN I MET MICHELE, I WAS PRETTY FULLY FORMED. BECAUSE I HAD LEFT TRADE SCHOOL AND I WAS WORKING IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND I HAD A JOB AND I HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO LIVE AND TO ENJOY MYSELF AND TO GO OUT AND TO GO TO NICE RESTAURANTS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. THERE WAS A MINUTE THERE EARLY ON WHEN I STARTED WORKING THAT I WAS AT MY MOST FLAMBOYANT, WHERE I FELT, “WOW, I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO.” I GOT TO LA LIKE IN ’79, ’80. I HAD 10 YEARS TO SOW MY OATS. I KIND OF TONED IT DOWN BY THE TIME I MET MICHELE. THE ’90S WERE WITH MICHELE. EVERYTHING SINCE THEN, MICHELE. WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR THIS SHOOT TO DRESS MICHELE IN ALL THESE CLOTHES? IT’S WHAT WE DO. IT WASN’T UNUSUAL. THAT’S A FUN WAY OF PLAYING FOR US. WHAT’S THE SECRET TO A LONG AND HAPPY MARRIAGE? I HAVE NO IDEA. WELL, YOU HAVE ONE. I KNOW. BUT IT’S JUST LUCK. AND IT’S ALSO A HAPPY MARRIAGE AND BUSINESS. THE BUSINESS PARTNERS I HAVE ARE THE ONES THAT I STARTED OUT WITH—THAT NEVER HAPPENS. AND THEY JUST FOUND ME. I FEEL LIKE YOU’RE BEING A LITTLE TOO HUMBLE ABOUT ALL OF THIS, IF I COULD BE HONEST. I’M ABSOLUTELY NOT. IT’S TOTALLY MAGIC BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE. I JUST REMEMBER THERE WAS SOME LITTLE VOICE IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD THINKING, “WELL, I JUST HAVE TO GET THROUGH THIS NOW, BECAUSE ONE DAY I WON’T HAVE TO DEAL WITH MY FINANCES.” WHERE DID THAT ARROGANCE COME FROM? WHERE DID THAT ENTITLEMENT COME FROM? I DEFINITELY WAS [FINANCIALLY] INSECURE AT THE BEGINNING. BUT THEN, THERE WAS THIS ARROGANCE, THIS ENTITLEMENT THAT I KNEW I HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL. THAT’S WHERE THE DRINKING CAME IN—BECAUSE I HAD TO REALLY GET OUT AND PROMOTE MYSELF IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT COMFORTABLE FOR ME. I WAS JUST LIKE, “YOU JUST GOT TO SURVIVE AND TREAD WATER AND KEEP YOURSELF OUT THERE UNTIL SOMEBODY FINDS YOU THAT CAN HELP.” SO THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID. AND THEY SHOWED UP. I WAS ALREADY SELLING CLOTHES AT THE RIGHT STORES—MARIA LUISA IN PARIS, CHARIVARI IN NEW YORK, AND MAYBE AT BROWNS IN LONDON. THAT’S HOW THEY FOUND ME. LUCA AND ELSA PROPOSED DISTRIBUTING ME AND HOOKING ME UP WITH A LICENSE IN ITALY. THEY WANTED TO START THEIR OWN THING, AND I WAS THEIR FIRST PROJECT. I THINK THEIR PLAN WAS TO HAVE A GROUP [WITH OTHER BRANDS], BUT THEY GOT ABSORBED IN US. THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO, AND AS OUR BUSINESS GREW, THEY DIDN’T HAVE TIME TO TAKE ON ANYBODY ELSE. SO I LITERALLY JUST MADE MYSELF AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC AND WAITED FOR SOMEBODY TO SHOW UP. AND IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN? AND HOW OFTEN DOES IT HAPPEN THAT YOU END UP WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR YOU? IF THERE’S A DISAGREEMENT IN THE BUSINESS, WHO WINS THE ARGUMENT, YOU OR ELSA? I CAN’T REALLY THINK OF ANY CONFLICT. I’M SURE THERE ARE MINOR ONES, BUT WE’RE BOTH SO SOLUTION-ORIENTED THAT NEITHER OF US REALLY WASTES TIME. WE CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT AND FIGURE EACH OTHER OUT. IT IS A MARRIAGE. THE OTHER THING IS, SHE AND LUCA HAVE SO MUCH KIND RESPECT FOR WHAT I DO, THEY DON’T TRY TO INFLUENCE THAT. IT’S EXACTLY THE SAME FOR ME WITH HER. I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN HERE WITHOUT ELSA. I’M NOT GOING TO SECOND-GUESS HER. IN 1981, RICK OWENS LEFT PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, WHERE HE WAS RAISED ON CATHOLIC SCHOOLING, JAPANESE WOODCUTS, AND WAGNER OPERAS, THE ONLY CHILD OF JOHN AND CONCEPCION OWENS. AFTER A STINT STUDYING PAINTING, HE WENT TO TRADE SCHOOL FOR PATTERN CUTTING. HE BECAME THE BEST PAIR OF SHEARS AT A HIGH-QUALITY DUPE FACTORY, AND EVEN WITHOUT MUCH OF A PLAN, HE ALREADY HAD A LOOK: “IT WAS JUST ALWAYS BLACK T-SHIRTS AND THE LEATHER JACKET. BUT I ALSO HAD MADE THIS BLACK VELVET COAT FOR A SCHOOL THING THAT ALREADY HAD THE PADDED QUILTED SHOULDERS. AND THEN I HAD THE NOSE RING WITH THE ROSARY TO MY EAR AND A LOT OF CHANEL WHITE BISQUE FOUNDATION. I NEVER DID LIPSTICK, BUT I HAD A SMOKY EYE, NOT REALLY BLACK LIKE I DO NOW [ON MODELS]. MY HAIR WAS KIND OF THIS MOHAWK-Y THING THAT WENT PARTLY THAT WAY [UP] AND THEN PARTLY THAT WAY [BACK]. IT WAS EITHER BLACK OR BLEACHED. AND THERE ARE NO PICTURES.” OWENS WAS PRIMED FOR REBELLION FROM AN EARLY AGE—REBELLING AGAINST HIS PARENTS, HIS CATHOLIC SCHOOL, AND THE STRINGENT 1960S SOCIETY OF HIS SMALL TOWN. BUT HIS EYES WERE OPENED TO A GLAMOUROUS AND KIND VERSION OF REBELLION WHEN HE CAME ACROSS DAVID BOWIE. “I THINK I WAS 17 WHEN I SAW DAVID BOWIE’S APPEARANCE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,” HE RECALLS OF BOWIE’S 1979 PERFORMANCE WITH JOEY ARIAS AND KLAUS NOMI. “I SAW THAT VIDEO ONLINE RECENTLY AND SOMEBODY IN THE COMMENTS SAID, ‘WOW, THIS TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE.’ GET IN LINE! I GUESS BOWIE CHANGED ALL OF US. THAT WAS A REAL TURNING POINT IN AESTHETIC CONTEMPORARY CULTURE. I STILL LOOK BACK ON IT, THINKING HOW IT BROUGHT THIS LEVEL OF GLAMOUROUS, COOL WEIRDNESS THAT I COULD HOOK ONTO AND THAT I COULD SO RELATE TO.” JOSEPH BEUYS, GUSTAVE MOREAU, JEAN COCTEAU, IGGY POP, PUNK AND GOTH ICONS, EVEN THE FALLEN SAINTS, THE WITCHES: THEY GIVE OWENS THE FREEDOM TO BE AGAINST SOMETHING. AFTER SEEING BOWIE’S DIAMOND DOGS ALBUM COVER, “I THOUGHT, ‘OH, I CAN DO THAT.’ THERE’S A PRECEDENT.” YOU ALWAYS SPEAK ABOUT YOUR CLOTHING AS BEING A REBELLION OR A REACTION AGAINST CONSERVATIVE NORMS. MAYBE THE FIRST TIME WE SPOKE, YOU SAID SOMETHING LIKE, “I’M NOT NICHE. I’M MAINSTREAM NOW.” DID I? YES. I REMEMBER BECAUSE I CALLED YOU NICHE, AND YOU CORRECTED ME. TEN YEARS LATER YOU’RE DEFINITELY RIGHT. I WISH I WAS NICHE. NICHE SOUNDS BETTER. I WASN’T BEING ARROGANT. I WAS KIND OF RESIGNING MYSELF TO THE FACT THAT I’VE OVEREXPOSED MYSELF AND SOLD OUT. I ALWAYS THINK, IF YOU KNOW WHO I AM, YOU’VE ALREADY DECIDED. BUT THEN I FORGET THAT THERE’S NEW PEOPLE, EVERY DAY, WHO ARE STARTING TO NOTICE AESTHETICS OR WHO ARE STARTING TO CONSIDER THE AESTHETIC CHOICES THEY’RE MAKING. THEY’RE JUST STARTING TO BECOME AWARE, LIKE I DID WHEN I SAW BOWIE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO REBEL AGAINST NOW? JUDGEMENT. MY BIGGEST MOTIVATION IS TO COMBAT JUDGEMENT. THAT’S WHAT THE PENTAGRAMS ARE FOR. THEY’RE PLAYFUL, THEY’RE KITSCH, AND THEY’RE CAMP, BUT THEY’RE ALSO ABOUT OTHERNESS. THEY’RE ALSO ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED FOR OTHERNESS, LIKE WITCHES BURNED AT THE STAKE, WHO WERE PROBABLY JUST REALLY FUN PEOPLE. PEOPLE’S INSTINCT TO CONDEMN THINGS THAT THEY DON’T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND OR ARE NOT COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH—THAT CONDEMNATION IS SOMETHING THAT I’VE EXPERIENCED. THE JUDGEMENT, THE CONDEMNATION, THE CONTEMPT. I FEEL WHAT EVERY GOTH FEELS: OH, YOU THINK I’M WEIRD? I’M GOING TO SHOW YOU WEIRD! ESPECIALLY NOW BECAUSE CONDEMNATION IS SO PERVASIVE AND SO ACCEPTED. IT IS JUST SO DUMB. THE OTHER LESSON IS JUDGEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE. IT’S NEVER GOING AWAY. IT IS PART OF THE GLORY AND THE HORROR OF LIFE, JUST LIKE EVIL, AND PAIN, AND SUFFERING. SOMEWHERE IT SERVES A PURPOSE, AN AWFUL PURPOSE, BUT IT’S PART OF LIFE. WHO’S JUDGING YOU? YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF LIES ONLINE ABOUT ME BEING A SATANIC PAEDOPHILE WITH AIDS OR WHATEVER. THE STUFF THAT YOU SEE ABOUT MICHELE IS WORSE. I DON’T KNOW IF I’VE REACHED A LEVEL WHERE I GET MORE OF THAT THAN NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD, BUT I THINK ANYBODY CAN RELATE TO BEING JUDGED VICIOUSLY OR JUST UNFAIRLY. THAT’S WHAT I’M REACTING AGAINST A LOT. YOU REACT TO JUDGEMENT IN A VERY PEACEFUL WAY. WILL YOU WATCH THE INAUGURATION LATER TODAY? OH NO. PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP REACT TO JUDGEMENT WITH SELFISHNESS AND VITRIOL AND EVIL. YOU REACT WITH YOUR WORK, WHICH IS SO WELCOMING AND BEAUTIFUL. I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE, A RETREAT. IT’S NOT A MANIFESTO. THERE’S ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF THE WORLD THAT’S LIKE ME, SO THIS IS THE PART OF THE WORLD THAT I’M HERE TO CELEBRATE AND EMBRACE. WHEN I SAID I WAS MAINSTREAM, IT’S LIKE MY NICHE SPILLED OVER SOMEHOW. REMEMBER WHEN I DID THAT BOOK ABOUT LARRY LEGASPI? THIS MAKES ME THINK OF HIM BECAUSE HE HAD A VERY SPECIFIC, FLAMBOYANT, MANHATTAN KIND OF AESTHETIC. THEN SOMEHOW, HE APPLIED IT TO BLACK SOUL CULTURE WITH LABELLE, AND THAT SPARK CREATED SOMETHING. THEN SOMEHOW HE GOT CONNECTED TO STADIUM ROCK [WITH KISS] AND THAT BECAME PART OF AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE. SO YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO LEAK OUT. I THINK SOMEWHERE WHAT I DID IS SIMILAR TO THAT, A LITTLE BIT. THE “LARRY” COLLECTION [FALL 2019], TO ME, FELT LIKE A TURNING POINT FOR YOU. THE CLOTHES GOT MORE GLAMOUROUS, IN A TRADITIONAL SENSE OF GLAMOUROUS. YOU CAN SEE OBVIOUS THROUGHLINES IN YOUR WORK—PLATFORMS, BLACK, DRAPERY—BUT ARE THERE ALSO MOMENTS WHEN YOU’VE MADE A MARKED CHANGE? PROBABLY THE ONE THAT’S MOST BLATANT THAT EVERYBODY HAS NOTICED IS THE PERIOD WHERE THE CLOTHES STARTED GETTING MORE ABSTRACT AND MORE CONSTRUCTED [“GLITTER,” FALL 2017]. THAT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT MICHELE. THAT’S WHEN SHE STARTED WEARING COMME DES GARÇONS. I ENDORSED IT, OF COURSE, BECAUSE NOBODY ON THE PLANET CAN WEAR COMME DES GARÇONS BETTER THAN HER. IT WASN’T LIKE A VIOLENT CONFLICT, BUT I DID FEEL LIKE: YOU ARE PART OF THIS WORLD. THIS IS OUR SURVIVAL AND YOU REPRESENT THAT. WE’VE BUILT THIS WHOLE THING TO SUPPORT YOU AND ME, AND THEN FOR YOU TO ENDORSE SOMEBODY ELSE FEELS DISLOYAL. AS A PARTNER, YOU SHOULD BE PROMOTING WHAT WE’RE SURVIVING ON. HER ANSWER WAS SO GOOD: “YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST FEEL MORE POWERFUL IN HER CLOTHES.” WAS THAT LIKE A KNIFE IN YOUR HEART? IT DEFINITELY STUNG. BUT I ALSO HAD TO LOOK AT IT WITH AN OBJECTIVE EYE. THIS IS WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT—EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS, I’M GOING TO USE IT. NOTHING IS OFF LIMITS. EVERYTHING IS PERSONAL. SO I THOUGHT, I’M GOING TO DO A BLOB LIKE THAT. COMME DOESN’T HAVE A MONOPOLY ON BLOBS. EVERYTHING THAT WE AS CREATORS DO IS A COMPOSITION OF EVERYTHING THAT WE’VE SEEN BEFORE. IT COULD BE A COMME DES GARÇONS BLOB, IT COULD BE A PETER PAN COLLAR FROM A GIVENCHY DRESS FROM THE 1950S. WE’RE ALL USING THAT STUFF. COMME IS USING STRAPS FROM JOHNNY ROTTEN’S LEATHER JACKET. OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS SOME LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT, LIKE, “HOW CAN I PROCESS IT ALL, THIS TINY SENSE OF BETRAYAL? MICHELE’S MY BEST CLIENT, HOW DO I FOLLOW ALONG WITH HER EVOLUTION AND THE WAY SHE FEELS ABOUT HERSELF AS SHE’S PHYSICALLY CHANGING?” THAT WAS YOUR ONLY STYLISTIC PIVOT? I CAN SEE THAT ONE BEST. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME THEY CAN SEE THE MINUTE THAT TYRONE [DYLAN SUSMAN, DESIGNER, STYLIST, AND MUSE] SHOWED UP. THAT CHANGED THINGS, TOO. IT MADE PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE, “TYRONE HAS RUINED EVERYTHING.” BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT THINK—AND PEOPLE IN MY TEAM WHO THINK—TYRONE IS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED FOR US. IT GOT US A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE IN THE WORLD. THOSE ARE THE MOST BLATANT ONES THAT I CAN THINK OF. I’M SURE I COULD POINT OUT MORE. TO ME, RICK OWENS’ CAREER HAS FOUR CHAPTERS. THE CALIFORNIAN EARLY DAYS, OF WHICH LITTLE DOCUMENTATION EXISTS, EXCEPT THE BIAS LEATHER JACKETS WORN BY COURTNEY LOVE, CORINNE DAY, AND KATE MOSS. THEN, HIS ETHEREAL HEAVENLY ERA, THE TRANSITION FROM UNDERGROUND TO ABOVEGROUND. THESE FASHION SHOWS OF HIS EARLY PARISIAN DAYS HAVE ANGELS AND NUNS, WAFTING CHIFFON AND REVEALING JERSEY. EVEN IF IT IS GOTHIC, THERE IS A SWEETNESS TO HIS FIRST DECADE IN PARIS, AN OPTIMISM OF FINDING ONESELF IN THE PLACE ONE WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE. AS THE WORLD TURNED MORE BRUTAL IN THE EARLY 2010S, SO DID OWENS’ WORK. IN 2014, HE HUNG A PUNK BAND UPSIDE DOWN ON THE RUNWAY THAT BEGAN A THIRD CHAPTER OF SHOWMANSHIP: THE 2014 STEP DANCER SHOW, THE WOMEN HUNG UPSIDE DOWN FROM OTHER WOMEN COLLECTION IN 2016, THE “GLITTER” COLLECTIONS OF 2017 (THAT COINCIDED WITH LAMY’S CDG ROMANCE), AND THE 2018 COLLECTION WHERE A FUNERAL PYRE BURNED AT THE CENTRE OF THE RUNWAY. THEN, LASTLY, WITH THE “LARRY” COLLECTIONS OF 2019, OWENS BEGAN TO FLIRT WITH GLAMOUR. HE’S BEEN DOING MERMAID HEMS, HOT PINK, GOLD, EVEN MORE VOLUPTUOUS PLATFORMS AND SEQUINS, MORPHING THEM INTO A RAVISHING REBELLION AGAINST THE HORRORS OF THE 2020S. DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE COLLECTION? I HAVE A FEW. I LIKE THOSE “GLITTER” COLLECTIONS [FALL 2017 MENSWEAR AND WOMENSWEAR] THAT WERE A RESPONSE TO MICHÈLE’S COMME DES GARÇONS. I ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE AND I RESPONDED WITH MY SOLUTION. THE STEP TEAM SHOW IS SO BEAUTIFUL, BUT IT’S ALSO SLIGHTLY UNNERVING BECAUSE I CAN SEE HOW THERE COULD BE A RAISED EYEBROW. I MEAN THAT TENSION AND THAT—WAS THAT WRONG OR IS IT RIGHT? THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THAT WAS CHALLENGING AND INTERESTING. I FEEL LIKE IT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG, BUT IT DIDN’T. WITH EVERY SHOW, YOU CAN SEE HOW THERE’S STILL THE RAGE IN ME. I HAVE TO ADMIT, NOW IT’S ALMOST A MORAL DUTY, BEING A REACTION TO JUDGEMENT AND CONDEMNATION. NOW I ALMOST FEEL LIKE AN EVANGELICAL URGE. IF I DO WELL, AND IF PEOPLE WANT TO BUY MY CLOTHES AND KNOW ABOUT ME, I CAN TALK ABOUT THIS MORE AND PUSH MY AGENDA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I CAN DO WITH MY LIFE. I HAVE THE POWER TO LEND MY VOICE TO THE OPPOSITE FORCE OF TRUMP. IT’S A SMALL VOICE, BUT IT’S SOMETHING I CAN DO. WHAT’S YOUR WORST COLLECTION? OH, I’M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLOTHES FROM THAT COLLECTION. BUT THERE ARE A FEW THAT ELSA AND I ALWAYS REFER TO. WE JUST DROP THAT NAME EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. SO THERE IS ONE THAT’S A KEYWORD? THERE IS, ACTUALLY. I WOULD CRINGE FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I LOOKED BACK AT IT. I LOOK AT IT NOW AND I’M GOING, “OH, WELL, THERE’S SOME CUTE IDEAS HERE.” WILL YOU TELL ME OFF THE RECORD WHAT SHOW THAT IS? I DON’T WANT TO MANIFEST IT. FOR EVERY STRAIN OF THE SACRED, THERE IS ALSO A SACRILEGIOUS CORE NESTLED INTO THE ACCEPTING AND LOVELY HEART OF RICK OWENS. ONE OF THE FIRST PICTURES OF HIM TO BE PUBLISHED IN A MAGAZINE WAS PUBLISHED RIGHT HERE IN I-D IN 2002. HE STANDS, LEATHER PANTS AT HIS ANKLES, PEEING RIGHT INTO HIS OWN MOUTH, A SECOND RICK COMPED ON THE LEFT PAGE, KNEELING RECEPTIVELY. NUMEROUS OTHER UROPHILIC PORTRAITS EXIST—HE CALLS ONE TAKEN BY NICK KNIGHT ALMOST A DECADE LATER “GLAM!”—AS WELL AS PICTURES OF OWENS BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT WITH A COLT .45, A VIDEO OF HIM SIMULATING SEX WITH A HORSE, AND, MORE RECENTLY, A PICTURE OF HIS CROTCH LIGHTLY COVERED BY PENTAGRAM UNDERWEAR TO PROMOTE A COLLABORATION WITH CHAMPION. (FEW REMEMBER THE SPECIFICS OF THE COLLAB, EVERYONE REMEMBERS THE PACKAGE.) THIS PERVERSITY EXTENDS TO HIS WORK. MALE MODELS WALKED WITH THEIR GENITALS EXPOSED IN HIS FALL 2015 “SPHINX” SHOW—HIS MOST BRAZEN FASHION DISPLAY OF PROVOCATION—BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS TAUT BARE TORSOS, EXTRA-LOW-RISE TROUSERS, AND GIGANTIC BOOTS WORN WITH BLACK-EYED CONTACT LENSES. WHEN HE WAS A CHILD, OWENS WOULD LISTEN AS HIS FATHER READ HIM FANTASY AND ADVENTURE BOOKS BY EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS. THE COVERS, ILLUSTRATED BY FRANK FRAZETTA, FEATURE BULGING MALE FIGURES, AMAZONIAN WOMEN, SATYRS, AND OTHER MYTHICAL CREATURES FUSED WITH THE HUMAN FORM. “IT’S MUSCLES AND GLAMOUR AND SEX,” OWENS SAYS, LOOKING AT PICTURES OF THE COVERS NOW. HE CHUCKLES, “I THINK THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.” I HEARD THAT WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE TEMPLE OF LOVE EXHIBITION, THE FIRST THING YOU SEE IS A STATUE OF YOU PEEING. OH, NOT THE FIRST THING. THAT IS THE FINALE. I DID IT ORIGINALLY FOR PITTI IMMAGINE 20 YEARS AGO. IT WAS PISSING ON A PILE OF MIRRORS ON A LITTLE PILE OF DIRT. IT WAS REFERENCING THAT PICTURE THAT I’D DONE A LONG TIME AGO OF ME PISSING IN MY MOUTH IN I-D. SO I’VE USED PISS A LOT. PISS IS ONE OF MY MOTIFS. I ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT ON THE AUDIO GUIDE IN FRENCH. I HEARD YOU WERE LEARNING FRENCH. HOW’S IT GOING? IT’S TERRIBLE. I FACETIME WITH AN INSTRUCTOR EVERY MORNING AT 11, LIKE SIX DAYS A WEEK. ONE OF THE TEXTS [IN THE AUDIO GUIDE] IS ABOUT PISS, IN FRENCH. I’M GOING TO READ IT TO YOU IN FRENCH. OKAY, I’LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND. [OWENS STARTS READING IN ENGLISH FROM THE CATALOGUE] NO, I’M JUST KIDDING! THIS IS MY INTRODUCTION TO THE FASHION WORLD. “IN 2002 WAS A SPREAD IN I-D MAGAZINE OF A SELF-PORTRAIT OF STANDING ME IN SHINY LEATHER PANTS PISSING INTO THE MOUTH OF A KNEELING ME IN SHINY LEATHER PANTS IN A CORNER OF MY CONCRETE STUDIO OFF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN LA. I THINK AT THE TIME, I WAS A BIT EMBARRASSED OF HAVING TO INSIST THAT MY VOICE WAS WORTH LISTENING TO, AND THE IDEA OF AN IMAGE OF ME KNEELING AT THE ALTAR OF MY OWN CREATIVE DISCHARGE FELT AT LEAST SLIGHTLY SELF-AWARE. I DIDN’T REALLY THINK OF IT AS BEING THAT PROVOCATIVE. “I THOUGHT OF IT AS AN ALLEGORICAL IMAGE RELATED TO SELF-ABSORPTION, ISOLATION, AND THE URGENCY OF EXPRESSION AND THE FEAR OF IT DYING ON THE VINE UNWITNESSED. IT ALSO BLUNTLY ALLUDED TO THE SEX CLUB LIFE I’D BEEN IMMERSED IN MY YOUNGER YEARS, A PERIOD OF UNSENTIMENTAL AND PRIMITIVE SENSATION THAT HAD A PLEASING SENSE OF STRICT PURITY AT THE TIME. PISS DRINKING WAS SUCH AN OPERATIC RITUAL SUBMISSION AND CONSUMING SOMEONE IN SUCH A PRIMAL WAY. IT WASN’T A CEREMONY I EVER ACTUALLY PRACTISED, BUT I WOULD GO ON TO USE THIS IMAGERY AS AN EXAMPLE OF EXTREME COMMITMENT IN SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT CREATIVE PROJECTS, A GESTURE OF DESIRE AS POIGNANT AS SALOME’S DEMAND FOR JOHN THE BAPTIST’S HEAD.” THERE’S A LOT OF SALOME IN THIS EXHIBITION. PART OF THAT, I REALISED, IS TO KIND OF UNDERLINE THE FACT THAT I’M NOT DOING ANYTHING NEW. MY GLOOMY PURSUIT OF TRANSCENDENCE HAS BEEN PART OF THE SYMBOLIST CULTURE OF PARIS SINCE GUSTAVE MOREAU’S TIME. I HAVE SOME GUSTAVE MOREAU PAINTINGS [IN THE EXHIBITION], BUT I ALSO HAVE A JOHN CHAMBERLAIN FOAM SCULPTURE THAT I THINK IS VERY AMERICAN. IT’S THIS GREAT CONTRAST, THIS BIG FOAM BLOB NEXT TO THESE EXQUISITE ANGELS. AND THERE WAS [A MOREAU PAINTING] CALLED ANGELS OF SODOM THAT WAS ALWAYS MY FAVOURITE, BUT THEY WOULDN’T LEND ME THAT ONE BECAUSE IT’S TOO FAMOUS. IN 2008, YOU MADE A REUSABLE COCK RING FASHIONED FROM A GOAT’S EYELID SOLD IN A TOADSKIN CASE. WHERE DO YOU SOURCE SUCH MATERIALS? [OWENS STARTS BOMBASTICALLY LAUGHING] OKAY. I DIDN’T INVENT THIS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?! I FOUND THEM IN A SEX SHOP. THERE’S SEX SHOPS ON RUE SAINT-DENIS THAT SELL THEM, AND THEY COME IN A LITTLE CARDBOARD ENVELOPE, AND IT’S GOT A SLIP OF PAPER WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS IN BAD ENGLISH. I INCLUDED THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY THE WAY THEY CAME. IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO MOISTEN IT AND YOU HAVE TO PLACE IT OVER THE “ACORN” OF THE PENIS. I GUESS THAT’S THE HEAD? [WE’RE LAUGHING EVEN HARDER, GASPING FOR AIR] I STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOULD WORK. I WOULD ASSUME IF IT’S GOING TO DO ANYTHING—I DON’T REALLY SEE HOW IT CAN—IT’S WITH THE EYELASHES, IF THEY’RE WET. SORRY, THERE’S EYELASHES STILL ON IT? YES. THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT. THAT’S THE POINT? OKAY. YOU FOUND THE TOADSKIN CASE TO SELL IT IN? NO, WE MADE THEM. [THE LAUGHTER IS SO GREAT WE CAN BARELY SPEAK] OF COURSE. THIS GOAT’S-EYE COCK RING IS THE WEIRDEST THING. IT WAS ALSO RESOURCEFUL. SUSTAINABLE EVEN! GLAMOUROUS IN THIS WEIRD … IS IT GLAMOUROUS? UHM? WELL, IT WAS GROTESQUE. THAT’S WHAT IT WAS. THE FACT OF PUTTING IT IN THIS GLAMOUROUS WHITE, BLEACHED, ALBINO TOADSKIN CASE AND PUTTING IT IN A HIGH-FASHION CONTEXT, THAT WAS JUST SOME SYMBOLISM. DADAIST SHIT. ANY OTHER SECRETS YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH ME? I’M SUCH A BLABBERMOUTH. I JUST GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY. ALSO, SECRETS SEEM A LITTLE VAIN. WHY DO I THINK MY LIFE IS SO IMPORTANT THAT ANYTHING’S WORTH KEEPING IT A SECRET? ON THE OTHER HAND, OVERSHARING IS TACKY, A BIT NARCISSISTIC. MICHELE CALLED ME A NARCISSIST ONCE. I WAS LIKE, “WHERE DID SHE PICK UP THAT WORD? AM I?” I’M ALWAYS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT SIDE OF ME. I DID, SOMEWHERE, HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONFIDENCE AND ARROGANCE TO INSIST THAT WHAT I WAS DOING WAS WORTH LOOKING AT. FOR SOMEBODY AS OVERLY SENSITIVE AND AS FRAGILE AS I WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNG, TO HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET HERE … I THINK IF ANYBODY’S LISTENING, IT PROVES THAT IF I CAN DO IT, ANYBODY CAN DO IT. SO THAT’S WHY I OVERSHARE. AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR CONVERSATION, OWENS PRODUCES A SCAN OF HIS BIRTH CHART MADE BY HIS LATE FATHER, JOHN OWENS. RICHARD SATURNINO OWENS WAS BORN AT 9:31 A.M. ON NOVEMBER 18, 1961 IN ENCINO, CALIFORNIA. HE IS A SCORPIO SUN, CAPRICORN RISING, ARIES MOON. HIS FATHER, A CONSERVATIVE “BIGOT”—OWENS’ WORDS, “I SAID THAT I FELT HE WAS BIGOTED IN ANOTHER ARTICLE, AND AFTER THAT, HE NEVER SPOKE TO ME AGAIN”—NOT ONLY HAND-DREW THIS BIRTH CHART, BUT ALSO CHOSE THE NAME SATURNINO. “I THINK IT WAS A MIDDLE NAME SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE IN MY MOM’S FAMILY, BUT DAD HEARD ABOUT IT AND HE LIKED IT,” OWENS EXPLAINS. “DAD WAS SO PEDANTIC AND RATIONAL, STUDYING PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHIATRY. SO, IT’S A SURPRISINGLY MYSTICAL MOVE ON HIS SIDE.” I’LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW OF SATURN. SATURN IS THE FATHER OF THE GODS, HIS SHRINE THE HIGHEST ON THE PALATINE HILL. CLOAKED IN RAW WOOL, HE PRESIDED, IF YOU BELIEVE VIRGIL’S AENEID, OVER THE LATIUM FOR A SHORT MOMENT IN THE LONG LIFE OF ROME, BUT IN THAT MOMENT SATURN GAVE LAWS TO ALL THE NYMPHS, SATYRS, AND FAUNS OF THE HILLS. HE DIDN’T TAME THEM, BUT HE LED THEM. IT WAS A FAIR AND PROSPEROUS ERA. NAVIGATING THE COMPLICATED AND MESSY WORLDS OF FASHION, LOVE, BUSINESS, SEX, CELEBRITY, PARTYING, AND ART IS A BIT LIKE SURVIVING AT THE MERCY OF THE GODS. IT HAS KILLED LESSER MEN. IT KILLS THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN. RICK OWENS CAN’T BE KILLED.

THIS IS A CHURCH HE VISITS OFTEN—ALONE, OR WITH HIS LONGTIME ASSISTANT ANNA-PHILIPPA WOLF (A.K.A. AL) AND HER BABY—AND THAT HE CONSIDERS “AN EXTENSION OF MY HOUSE, PART OF MY LIFE HERE IN PARIS…A PERFECT LITTLE PLACE.” OWENS HIMSELF IS NOT RELIGIOUS, BUT HE LIKES A CHURCH, OR THE IDEA OF A CHURCH. “AT ITS BEST, IT IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER TO FORM A SYSTEM OF LIVING FOR TAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER,” HE SAYS, AND THEN REPEATS: “AT ITS BEST.” HE SPECIFICALLY LOVES SAINT CLOTILDE BECAUSE IT IS WHERE HE AND HIS PARENTS WOULD DISCUSS CREMATION AND BURIAL AND HAVE ALL THOSE HARD END-OF-LIFE CONVERSATIONS WHEN THEY WOULD VISIT HIM DURING THE SHOW SEASONS. (“DAD WAS NOT RELIGIOUS—HE NEVER WAS—BUT MOM WAS CATHOLIC.”) NOW THAT HIS PARENTS HAVE PASSED, OWENS’S MIND INEVITABLY TURNS TO MORTALITY AS HE WALKS THE FEW BLOCKS OF THE 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT BETWEEN THE CHURCH, HIS HOME-SLASH-HQ ON PLACE DU PALAIS-BOURBON, AND, À TRAVERS LA SEINE, THE LOUVRE AND THE PALAIS ROYALE. “I GUESS I KIND OF BELONG HERE NOW,” HE SAYS. “THIS IS THE STREET I AM GOING TO GET OLD ON, WHERE THE WAITERS ARE GOING TO GET TIRED OF ME ORDERING THE SAME THING ALL THE TIME.” AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS, THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AND VENETIAN LIDO-LOVING OWENS HAS ADOPTED PARIS AS HIS OWN. AND THE CITY OF LIGHT HAS RESPONDED IN KIND, WITH UNCHARACTERISTIC BRAS OUVERT. ON JUNE 28, THE PALAIS GALLIERA, PARIS’S PREMIER FASHION MUSEUM, WILL OPEN “TEMPLE OF LOVE,” A RETROSPECTIVE OF HIS WORK. IT IS ONE OF THE VERY RARE INSTANCES THAT THE GALLIERA HAS DEVOTED ITS SPACE TO A LIVING DESIGNER—OWENS FOLLOWS AZZEDINE ALAÏA AND MARTIN MARGIELA—AND TO A VERY DESERVING ONE AT THAT. RICK OWENS’S CAREER IS AN UTTER MARVEL: COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE FOR DECADES, THE CONGLOMERATES BE DAMNED, WITH INCREASING RELEVANCE YEAR ON YEAR BY ANY MEASURE AND FOR ANY AUDIENCE—FROM THE MOST ELITE MINDS IN FASHION TO SKATE GOTHS THE WORLD OVER. OWENS HAS PROVEN THAT AN UNCOMMON MIX OF AESTHETIC BRAVERY, DISARMING INTELLIGENCE, FEARLESS CURIOSITY, AND WACK-A-DOODLE, BOOTSTRAPPY WORK ETHIC CAN DEFY THE LUXURY INDUSTRY’S TREND PROGNOSTICATORS, ECONOMIC EEYORES, AND COMPETITIVE BACKBITERS TO CREATE SOMETHING BIGGER AND MORE TRANSCENDENT THAN THE BOOM-AND-BUST NARRATIVES OF HIS PEERS. “I KNOW THAT I AM UNUSUAL IN THE FASHION WORLD, WITH ITS REVOLVING WORLD OF DESIGNERS,” OWENS ADMITS. “I WAS JUST LUCKY TO END UP WITH PARTNERS”—BY WHICH HE MEANS HIS WIFE, MICHÈLE LAMY; AND LUCA RUGGERI AND ELSA LANZO OF OWENSCORP—“WHO HAVE PROTECTED ME SO FIERCELY FOR 30 YEARS. THEIR TALENT IS AS IMPORTANT AS ANY TALENT OF MINE. OTHER DESIGNERS MUST ENVY ME FOR THAT. I WAS VERY, VERY LUCKY.” THE PALAIS GALLIERA SHOW, CURATED BY ALEXANDRE SAMSON (WHO ALSO OVERSAW THE ACCLAIMED “1997 FASHION BIG BANG” IN 2023, AMONG OTHER EXHIBITIONS), WILL FEATURE DESIGNS FROM OWENS’S YEARS IN PARIS FOR HIS EPONYMOUS LINE, ALONG WITH HIS WORK FOR REVILLON (THE HERITAGE FUR HOUSE THAT HIRED HIM IN 2002, PROVIDING THE IMPETUS FOR HIS RELOCATION), HIS COLLABORATION WITH FORTUNY (VENICE BEING AN ESSENTIAL PART OF HIS EMOTIONAL AND CULTURAL MAP), AND PIECES FROM LOS ANGELES, WHERE HIS AESTHETIC AND HIS BUSINESS WERE BORN IN AN EASTSIDE STUDIO ACROSS FROM HIS THEN PARTNER, NOW WIFE LAMY’S RESTAURANT, LES DEUX CAFES. (LAMY’S LA WARDROBE WILL BE REPRODUCED IN THE MUSEUM, AS WILL THE COUPLE’S MONOLITHIC PLATFORM BED FROM THAT TIME—I.E., THE BED THAT BEGAT THE DESIGNER’S MADE-TO-ORDER FURNITURE LINE, NOW OVERSEEN BY LAMY; TRAVIS SCOTT HAS ONE.) THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF THREADBARE “SPIDERWEBBY” TEES FROM THOSE EARLY YEARS, AS WELL AS RUNWAY SHOWSTOPPERS (HIS MAD MAX–MEETS–MADAM SATAN CONSTRUCTIONS OF LEATHER, SILK, AND JERSEY, ALL SHARP-SHOULDERED AND SINUOUS, EQUAL PARTS BRUTALIST AND ROMANTIC), STRIPPED DOWN TO THEIR COMPONENT PARTS. (“CAN WE NOT DO THE FULL LOOKS?” OWENS SAYS HE ASKED SAMSON. “THIS REALLY QUIETS IT DOWN.”) THERE WILL BE ALBUM COVERS BY DAVID BOWIE, KLAUS NOMI, AND IGGY POP, AND A SOUNDTRACK THAT STRETCHES FROM THE SISTERS OF MERCY TO GUSTAV MAHLER. AND THERE WILL BE DRAPED EVENING CONCOCTIONS—MADAME GRÈS GOES TO THE MOON?—THAT DEFY EASY EXPLANATION OR REPLICATION. (“WILL I EVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT AGAIN IN MY LIFE?” OWENS ASKS, WITHOUT IRONY.) IN A “JOY OF DECADENCE” ROOM WITH LIMITED ACCESS FOR THOSE WITH YOUNG’UNS OR THE SQUEAMISH, THERE WILL BE THE LIFE-SIZE STATUE OF THE DESIGNER URINATING THAT MADE ITS DEBUT IN FLORENCE IN 2006. FOR ALL ITS DISPARATE ELEMENTS, THOUGH, THE INTENT OF THE SHOW IS TO MAKE CLEAR OWENS’S TECHNICAL SKILLS AS A PATTERNMAKER, CUTTER, AND DRAPER, AND TO SHOWCASE HIS CLASSICAL IMAGINATION. “I WANT PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY KNOW RICK OWENS TO BE SURPRISED BY HIS CULTURAL SIDE,” SAYS SAMSON, “WHICH IS VERY ROOTED IN FRENCH CULTURE…. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO RICK OWENS THAN TRANSGRESSION.” INDEED: WHAT OWENS WANTS THE PUBLIC TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE EXHIBITION IS SOME NOTION OF THE “KINDNESS” AND “GENTLENESS” THAT INFORM HIS DESIGNS—WHICH, HE FEELS, HAVE BEEN MISREAD AS EVERYTHING FROM SATANIC TO APOCALYPTIC. BUT TO UNDERSTAND RICK OWENS’S WORK, YOU HAVE TO PERCEIVE IT THROUGH HIS GAZE. WHEN HE UNLEASHES 200 MODELS AND STUDENTS WALKING IN UNISON AROUND THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, SAY, AS HE DID A YEAR AGO FOR HIS SEMINAL HOLLYWOOD MEN’S SHOW, YOU HAVE TO SEE IN THOSE BLACK-EYED HORDES OF TOWERING DUDES HIS EMBRACE OF THE SUPERFANS WHO STAND OUTSIDE HIS SHOW SEASON ON SEASON. AND WHEN HE CHOSE TO HAVE MODELS WALK THE RUNWAY CARRYING OTHER MODELS ON THEIR BACKS, AS HE DID FOR WOMEN’S SPRING-SUMMER 2016, YOU HAVE TO HEAR HIM QUESTIONING THE RELEVANCE OF THE STILETTO: “HOW CAN I USE PHYSICALITY IN A NEW WAY?” HE ASKS HIMSELF. “HOW CAN I DO SOMETHING SPECTACULAR WITHOUT BEING WASTEFUL?” THE RETROSPECTIVE IS, IN A SENSE, AN ACT OF TRANSLATION, MEANT TO MAP HIS SINGULAR, REMARKABLE JOURNEY FROM HOLLYWOOD CLUB KID IN TATTERED, SURVIVALIST MODE TO THE KIND OF FLANEUR WHO VISITS CHURCH GARDENS WITH A TODDLER, ADMIRES THE “GRACE” WITH WHICH HIS WIFE NAVIGATES THE WORLD, AND DEEPLY MISSES HIS MOM AND DAD. “I LIKE PROMOTING VALUES THAT ARE SOFTER,” OWENS SAYS. “INCLUSIVITY IS SUCH A CORNY WORD NOW, BUT I THINK THE AESTHETIC WORLD THAT I HAVE TRIED TO CREATE IS INCLUSIVE. THE IRONY, THOUGH, IS THAT ONCE YOU REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL, PEOPLE DEFEND IT SO CLOSELY THAT THEY GATEKEEP SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED IN. IT BECOMES A FORTRESS. SO YOU CAN’T WIN.” THE LARGER IRONY, OF COURSE, IS THAT LATELY, INCLUSIVITY IS HARDLY A CORNY ASPIRATION, MORE AN ACT OF DEFIANCE IN AN INCREASINGLY CORPORATIST, MONOCULTURAL WORLD. OWENS FREQUENTLY SPEAKS ABOUT HIS HORROR OF WALKING THROUGH AIRPORT DUTY-FREE ZONES THE WORLD OVER AND ENCOUNTERING, EVERYWHERE, THE SAME PERFECTED, NORMATIVELY BEAUTIFUL FACES STARING OUT FROM MAKEUP-COUNTER POSTERS AND VIDEO SCREENS. “IT IS A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF RULES OF ASPIRATION AND ATTRACTION,” HE SAYS. “THAT IS THE GLOBAL STANDARD. AND I DON’T REJECT IT—IT’S WONDERFUL. MY ROLE IS TO PROVIDE OTHER OPTIONS.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

BUT PERHAPS IT’S PRECISELY FOR THIS REASON THAT THE FRENCH CAPITAL’S FIRST MAJOR SHOW DEDICATED TO THE CALIFORNIAN DESIGNER CARRIES WITH IT THE EXPLOSIVE ANTICIPATION OF AN UNMISSABLE EVENT. AFTER ALL, THE TITLE ALONE PROMISES AS MUCH: TEMPLE OF LOVE (FROM JUNE 28 TO JANUARY 4, 2026). RICK OWENS, THEN, TRANSFORMS THE NEO-RENAISSANCE BUILDING OF THE MUSÉE DE LA MODE DE LA VILLE DE PARIS INTO A “TEMPLE OF LOVE”—A SEMANTIC TWIST THAT FEELS PROVOCATIVE, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE VIOLENT ERA WE’RE LIVING THROUGH, YET ALSO TIMELY, AS IT AVOIDS SENTIMENTALITY THROUGH CLOTHING. ALONGSIDE 100 LOOKS DISPLAYED IN A THEATRICAL SCENOGRAPHY, THE EXHIBITION INCLUDES PHOTOGRAPHS, VIDEOS, DOCUMENTS, AND A SITE-SPECIFIC INSTALLATION THAT EVEN TRANSFORMS THE BUILDING’S FAÇADE. WHY? “RITUALS OF BEAUTY ARE WHAT I PRESENT AND JUDGMENTAL CONDEMNATION IS WHAT I OPPOSE AND AN OPEN HEART IS WHAT I PROMOTE,” SAYS RICK OWENS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH STYLE MAGAZINE. AND JUST LIKE IN HIS EARLY DAYS—MUCH LIKE THE PERSON WRITING THESE LINES—HE OPENS A LOGICAL-DIALECTICAL PATH THAT STRIPS AWAY EVERY TRACE OF CONTRADICTION. HE CONTINUES: “THE TITLE OF THE EXHIBITION ALSO REFERS TO MY FAVORITE SONG BY THE SISTERS OF MERCY WHICH WAS THE SOUNDTRACK TO MY TEENAGED ANGST, A PERIOD OF CONFUSION, GROWTH AND LEARNING THAT I LOOK BACK ON WITH GREAT AFFECTION.” SO, WHAT DOES THIS EXHIBITION MEAN TO HIM? “TEMPLE OF LOVE IS A SHOW OF ALL MY SHOWS. IT IS A GRAND SUMMARY OF WHAT I HAVE DONE, AND IT IS PROFOUNDLY SATISFYING TO HAVE IT VALIDATED BY ONE OF THE SUMMITS OF FASHION HISTORY: PARIS.” RECONCILING OWENS’ RADICAL FASHION WITH THE TRADITIONAL FORMAT OF A MUSEUM EXHIBITION MIGHT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE. HOW DID HE BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THESE TWO CONTRASTING WORLDS? “I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR TRADITIONAL VALUES THAT ARE BASED ON GRACE, KINDNESS AND COMMUNITY. I ONLY PROTEST FORCES OF BULLYING, OPPRESSIVE MALICE, WHICH I ACCEPT AS AN UNFORTUNATE FACT OF EVERYDAY LIFE. IT IS MY ROLE TO PROVIDE THE OPPOSITE OF THOSE FORCES AS A BALANCING ACT.” AND WHAT DOES HE HOPE PEOPLE WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THE SHOW? “I PROPOSE AESTHETIC OPTIONS ALTERATIVE TO THOSE WHICH ARE PREDOMINANTLY PROMOTED AS OUR CURRENT CULTURAL STANDARDS. MAYBE SOME WILL SEE THEIR PERSONAL INTERESTS REFLECTED HERE..” WORK AND FASHION ARE, IN FACT, THE CLEAREST SIGNALS OF THAT ALTERNATIVE AESTHETIC WHICH EMERGES FROM OWENS’ UNIQUE APPROACH. WHAT’S PERHAPS MOST SURPRISING IS HOW SEAMLESSLY THESE SAME ELEMENTS SHAPE HIS PRIVATE LIFE. DESPITE APPEARANCES, HIS LIFE IS GROUNDED IN UNFILTERED SELF-EXPRESSION AND A DEEP COMMITMENT TO WORK. KNOWN AS A PERFECTIONIST AND WORKAHOLIC, OWENS OFTEN SPENDS WEEKS AT A TIME IN HIS FACTORY IN CONCORDIA, A SMALL TOWN IN ITALY’S MODENA REGION, LIVING IN AN APARTMENT JUST ABOVE THE PRODUCTION FLOOR—OVERSEEING EVERY SINGLE ITEM THAT BEARS HIS NAME. FROM THIS UNUSUAL DAILY RHYTHM OF THOUGHTS AND PRACTICES, HIS FASHION IS BORN. AND FROM HIS FASHION, THIS EXHIBITION. IT’S NOT COMMON FOR THE SUBJECT OF A FASHION EXHIBITION TO ALSO BE ITS CURATOR. BUT THEN AGAIN, WHO ELSE COULD TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE OF TURNING A FASHION ARCHIVE INTO A LIFE STORY? EVEN ASSIGNING AN ADJECTIVE TO OWENS’ WORK IS DIFFICULT—HE ISN’T SIMPLY A TRANSGRESSIVE FIGURE, BUT A CULTURAL LENS. OWENS IS A MISFIT, ONE WHO REACHES THE CORE OF THINGS THROUGH A SHIFTED PERSPECTIVE, REVEALING FACETS OF THE WORLD THAT MOST ONLY GLANCE AT FROM ONE ANGLE. SINCE HIS PARIS DEBUT IN 2003 (HIS FASHION DEBUT WAS IN LOS ANGELES IN 1992), RICK OWENS HAS NEVER SHOCKED SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF IT. INSTEAD, HE HAS PRESENTED NEW WAYS TO INTERPRET FASHION. HIS STORY BEGAN IN 1961 IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA— “THE CITY OF DISCONTENT”—FROM WHICH HE FLED TO REINVENT HIMSELF IN LOS ANGELES. IT COULD’VE BEEN A TYPICAL STORY OF SOMEONE SEEKING FAME, BUT OWENS HAD A DIFFERENT AMBITION: TO BECOME THE AUTHOR OF HIS OWN LIFE. IN THE CITY OF POSSIBILITIES—HOLLYWOOD—HE MET MICHÈLE LAMY, A FORMER STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHER GILLES DELEUZE WHO HAD MOVED TO CALIFORNIA FROM FRANCE’S JURA REGION. A NIGHTLIFE ICON WITH A BACKGROUND IN EXPERIMENTAL FILM, SHE HAD ALREADY BEGUN TURNING HERSELF INTO A LIVING PERFORMANCE THROUGH TATTOOS AND CLOTHING—EARLY SIGNS OF THE PERSONAL BODY ART THAT NOW DEFINES HER. TOGETHER, THEY FOUNDED A FASHION LINE NOT JUST AS AN ALTERNATIVE AESTHETIC, BUT AS A RADICAL VISION. IT WASN’T ENOUGH TO SIMPLY BE OUTSIDERS—THEY WANTED TO RESHAPE THE CENTER. IN 2003, PARIS—AND THE WORLD—TOOK NOTICE WHEN OWENS STAGED A RUNWAY SHOW USING THE HISTORIC FURRIER REVILLON’S PIECES, TURNED INSIDE OUT. THE EFFECT WAS SHOCKING MODELS SPUN IN LAYERS OF FUR THAT BECAME ABSTRACT SCULPTURES, CONCEALING LIMBS AND DISTORTING BODIES. SOME WERE OUTRAGED BY WHAT THEY SAW AS THE DESECRATION OF A FRENCH FASHION INSTITUTION. OTHERS UNDERSTOOD FASHION HISTORY WAS BEING REWRITTEN IN REAL TIME. THAT SAME YEAR MARKED THE START OF THE OWENS-LAMY ERA IN EUROPE, AND THE BEGINNING OF THEIR ROLE AS GUIDING FIGURES FOR A NEW FASHION COMMUNITY—ONE THAT NO LONGER WANTED TO CONFORM AND FINALLY HAD A PATH TO BREAK FREE. OWENS’ POLITICAL VOICE HAS ONLY GROWN LOUDER SINCE. THROUGH HIS SHOWS, HE HAS ADDRESSED INTOLERANCE AND PATRIARCHY BY FEATURING AFRICAN AMERICAN STEPPING CREWS, SPEAKING BOLDLY ABOUT SEX AND BODIES, AND CRAFTING GARMENTS THAT ACT AS SCULPTURES. HIS AESTHETIC ISN’T ALWAYS EASY, BUT IT ALWAYS SPARKS QUESTIONS. THIS EXHIBITION STANDS AS PROOF OF EVERY ONE OF THOSE PROVOCATIONS. AND PERHAPS, AS OWENS HOPES, IT WILL ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO FINALLY SEE THEMSELVES—TRULY—IN THE WORK HE CREATES.

MOODBOARD: IS THIS EXHIBITION A GIGANTIC PERFORMANCE? RICK OWENS: YES, IT IS! THE WHOLE THING IS JUST A PERFORMANCE. WE EVEN COVERED THE STATUES IN THE GARDEN WITH BOXES. M: FOR THE FIRST TIME, PALAIS GALLIERA IS DISRUPTING ITS CODES SO MUCH. DID THIS FORM OF TOTAL ART ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES? RO: YES. I WANTED TO BOX IN THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN IN AN OBELISK, BUT IT DIDN&#39;T WORK. TECHNICALLY, IT WASN&#39;T REALLY BEAUTIFUL. WE HAD TO LEAVE THEM OPEN FOR THE WATER TO FLOW. THE METAL STRUCTURE LOOKED UNFINISHED. SO, I REALIZED WE WEREN&#39;T GOING TO FIND A GREAT RESULT THE FOLLOWING WEEK. SO I CANCELED IT. SO, NOT ALL IDEAS WORK! SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO THROW IDEAS AWAY. I THROW THEM AWAY ALL THE TIME. M: WHO ARE THESE GIANTS? RO: AMONG THEM IS A STATUE OF SAINT GENEVIEVE ON THE PONT DE LA TOURNELLE QUAY, IN AN ART DECO STYLE. THESE ARE TOTEMS WHOSE FORMS I HAVE OFTEN REVISITED. WHEN I REVIEW EVERYTHING I&#39;VE PREPARED IN THE EXHIBITION CATALOG, ALL THE IMAGES, I REALIZE IT. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD WAS THAT CAPE MADE OF MILITARY BLANKETS WITH STRONG SHOULDERS. IT&#39;S SOMETHING I CONTINUE TO DO. M: DO YOU STILL HAVE IT? RO: I LOST THAT CAPE BECAUSE I NEVER KEPT ARCHIVES. WHO THOUGHT ABOUT ARCHIVES BACK THEN? I WAS THINKING ABOUT SURVIVAL, THAT&#39;S ALL. LAST FALL, I REMADE THOSE MILITARY BLANKET CAPES FOR THE COLLECTION. I PHOTOGRAPHED THEM. TODAY, IT HAS BECOME THE MOTIF OF THE EXHIBITION. THAT FORM WAS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING. I ALSO USED IT FOR THE POSTER. I ALSO ADDED SEQUINS BECAUSE... WHY NOT! M: CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE GARDEN? RO: FOR THE GARDEN, WE BUILT THIS TRELLIS ON WHICH I HOPE THE BLUE MORNING GLORIES WILL CLIMB. MORNING GLORIES ARE WILD FLOWERS THAT GROW IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE FLOWERS THAT GROW IN ABUNDANCE. THESE LIGHT BLUE FLOWERS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, SO INNOCENT, AND SO MODEST. I LOVED THEM AS A CHILD BECAUSE THEY GREW IN THE FIELDS AROUND MY PARENTS&#39; HOUSE WHERE I GREW UP. WHEN WE MOVED TO HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, THE SIDE STREET WAS VERY ISOLATED, INFESTED, AND DIRTY. IN THE ALLEY BEHIND, I PLANTED MORNING GLORY SEEDS THAT EXPLODED INTO A CANOPY OVER THAT ALLEY WHERE WE USED TO SHOWER. THOSE MORNING GLORIES ARE STILL THERE. THEY STILL BURST WITH LIGHT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO BRING THEM HERE. FROM PORTERVILLE TO HOLLYWOOD, TO PARIS, I THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL STORY. M: TELL US ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS WITH THE GARDENERS. RO: I HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE GARDENERS, AND I TOLD THEM I ONLY WANTED MORNING GLORIES. THEY TOLD ME: &quot;IF YOU DO THAT, MAYBE THE MORNING GLORIES WON&#39;T BLOOM, THAT CAN HAPPEN.&quot; USUALLY, THEY PLANT A DIVERSITY OF PLANTS TO ENSURE THEIR HOLD AND BLOOMING. SO I ASKED: &quot;HOW MANY VARIETIES OF FLOWERS DO YOU NEED?&quot; ANSWER: &quot;57!&quot; THEY LET ME REDUCE IT TO ABOUT TWENTY. I TRIED TO KEEP EVERYTHING BLUE. THAT WAS OUR NEGOTIATION. LIKE A COMPROMISE. WE SELL MORNING GLORY SEEDS AT THE GIFT SHOP. M: JOSEPH BEUYS INFLUENCED YOU A LOT. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE REFERENCE TO THIS ARTIST, INSTALLED IN THE EXHIBITION? RO: IT&#39;S A JOSEPH BEUYS INSTALLATION FROM A 1970S PERFORMANCE WHOSE IMAGE I KEPT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ART STUDENT. IT WAS HIM, WEARING HIS HAT AND JACKET, HOLDING SYMBOLS IN FRONT OF A WHITE HORSE DURING AN ACTION IN GERMANY TITLED: IPHIGENIA. THERE WILL BE A VIDEO OF HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE EXHIBITION. HE WAS MY FIRST ARTISTIC HERO. THAT&#39;S WHY I USE GRAY FELT ALL THE TIME. SO, THIS ENTIRE SPACE IN THE FIRST ROOM OF THE EXHIBITION IS LINED WITH GRAY FELT. M: WHY DID HE RESONATE WITH YOU? RO: HIS ART WENT BEYOND THE CANVAS. HE ENTERED INTO PERFORMANCE, INTO A DIFFERENT WAY OF LIFE. IT WAS MYTHOLOGICAL, ROMANTIC, MORAL, AND VERY POETIC. HE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE IN THE WAY HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE MATCHED HIS AESTHETIC. THE STORY WAS COMPLETE AND IN-DEPTH. THERE WAS SOMETHING HEROIC, BUT ALWAYS ALIENATED. HIS COMMITMENT WAS DEEP AND PURE FROM BEGINNING TO END. MICHÈLE ALWAYS TELLS ME: &quot;YOU ONLY LIKE DEAD ARTISTS.&quot; YES! I WANT TO SEE THE COMPLETE STORY. I WANT TO SEE THAT ARTISTS MAINTAINED THEIR STANDARDS FROM BEGINNING TO END, AND THAT THEY DIDN&#39;T CHANGE COURSE. SOME CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED OR COMPLETELY FORMED. AND I&#39;M NOT READY TO COMMIT TO THEM EMOTIONALLY. M: CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE AXIAL ROOM WHERE THE URINATING STATUE IS LOCATED? RO: IT WAS MY FIRST EDITORIAL FOR INTERVIEW MAGAZINE. RICK CASTRO AND MICHI TOMIMATSU WERE PARTNERS AND STYLISTS. I WAS MAKING NIPPLE RINGS, THAT&#39;S WHY THEY&#39;RE THERE. FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER, THERE&#39;S BEEN THIS FETISHISTIC ASPECT. M: WHAT DOES A NIPPLE RING LOOK LIKE? RO: THEY WERE RINGS MOUNTED ON LEATHER NIPPLE COVERS. M: IS THIS YOUR FIRST DESIGN? RO: IT&#39;S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I SOLD THAT GOT PUBLISHED. THAT WAS IN 1986. BEFORE I MADE COLLECTIONS, I DESIGNED SMALL WEIRD THINGS LIKE THAT. I SOLD THEM IN A STRANGE STORE ON MELROSE. IT WAS PART OF THE NIGHTCLUB COMMUNITY. IT WAS MORE OF A GAY SUBCULTURE, IT HADN&#39;T REALLY REACHED THE MAINSTREAM. M: CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR PENTAGRAMS? RO: WE DID IT FOR THE MEN&#39;S SHOW AT THE LIDO DURING COVID. I DON&#39;T LIKE EXPLAINING THINGS, BUT I&#39;M GOING TO BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE MISINTERPRET THEM. I USE THE PENTAGRAM AS AN ANTI-MORALISTIC SYMBOL. IT&#39;S MY PLAYFUL RESPONSE TO CONTEMPT FOR OTHERNESS. I LIKE GEOMETRIC SYMBOLS. THEY REPRESENT THE EFFORTS MAN MAKES TO CREATE A SENSE OF ORDER IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR. DRAWING A STAR FEELS LIKE A MAGICAL RITE. MAKING IT PHALLIC, BY ELONGATING ITS POINT, GIVES IT A JOYOUS SIDE. OF COURSE, &quot;PHALLIC&quot; HAS A DOUBLE MEANING HERE. M: DO YOU WEAR THEM? RO: I DON&#39;T REALLY WEAR UNDERWEAR, BUT I SOMETIMES WEAR THEM TO SWIM AT THE LIDO. M: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO PROJECT ON THESE SCREENS? RO: THERE ARE FIFTEEN VIDEO SCREENS THAT WILL SHOW THE &quot;BUTT MUSCLE&quot; VIDEO. THERE&#39;S ALSO A VIDEO OF ME DYEING MY HAIR. A VIDEO OF ONE OF MY TEAM MEMBERS WHO HAD GLUED THE TWO LOGOS ON HIS BUTT. IN THE VIDEO, HE OPENS HIS BUTT TO SHOW THE LABEL INSIDE. THERE&#39;S A VIDEO OF ME GETTING F*ED BY A HORSE. THERE&#39;S A VIDEO FROM MY ONLYFANS THAT I RECENTLY OPENED. IT&#39;S DEDICATED TO MY FEET. I HAD SOCKS WITH &quot;SO&quot; ON ONE, &quot;CUNT&quot; ON THE OTHER. LAST SUMMER, I GOT &quot;SO CUNT&quot; TATTOOED ON MY FEET. SO, I OPENED AN ONLYFANS JUST TO SHOW MY FEET IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. THE PROFITS WILL BE DONATED TO ALLANAH&#39;S HOUSE, WHICH WELCOMES STRUGGLING YOUNG TRANS PEOPLE. M: THE LAST ROOM OF THE EXHIBITION IS A COPY OF YOUR SELF-DESIGNED BED. WILL YOU COME AND SLEEP HERE ONE NIGHT? RO: NO, PROBABLY NOT. BUT IT&#39;S STRANGE TO COME IN HERE BECAUSE IT&#39;S VERY SIMILAR. THE PROPORTIONS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT IT&#39;S LIKE A BIZARRE DÉJÀ VU. M: DESCRIBE THIS PAINTING YOU MADE FOR MICHÈLE LAMY. RO: IT&#39;S A PAINTING FROM 1998. MICHÈLE&#39;S BIRTHDAY IS FEBRUARY 5TH. THE PAINTING IS MADE ON OLD BLANKETS WITH BLACK HOUSE PAINT. THE INSPIRATION COMES FROM AN OLD PHOTO OF HER WITH HÉLÈNE HAZERA, A TRANS FRIEND SHE USED TO HAVE FUN WITH WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG. WHEN WE MOVED TO PARIS, WE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND. EVERYTHING WAS GONE. SO WE HAD TO REPRODUCE IT. THE RESULT IS EXCELLENT. I WENT TO ART SCHOOL BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST, AT THE OTIS ART INSTITUTE OF THE PARSONS SCHOOL OF DESIGN IN LOS ANGELES. I KEPT SOME PROJECTS AT MY PARENTS&#39; HOUSE. THEN, WHEN MY PARENTS PASSED AWAY, I HAD EVERYTHING SHIPPED TO CONCORDIA, WHERE WE CERTAINLY STILL HAVE SOME PIECES. EVERYTHING IS STORED UNDER BLANKETS, IN A DARK CORNER. I DON&#39;T WANT TO LOOK AT THEM AGAIN. M: WHAT DO YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT THIS COLLABORATION WITH ALEXANDRE SAMSON, THE CURATOR IN CHARGE OF THE EXHIBITION AT PALAIS GALLIERA? RO: IT WAS FUN TO TRUST! I WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS PROJECT IF I HADN&#39;T SEEN GOOD EXAMPLES OF PAST EXHIBITIONS. THE PALAIS GALLIERA HAS HELD SOME OF MY FAVORITE EXHIBITIONS. SEEING THEIR EXQUISITE DOCUMENTATION ON FASHION HISTORY AND EVERYTHING IT COVERS SO DEEPLY, I HAD TO SUBMIT AND GIVE UP A LOT OF CONTROL. ALEXANDRE SAMSON MUST BE LAUGHING BECAUSE I PROBABLY DIDN&#39;T SUBMIT AT ALL LIKE I THOUGHT I WOULD. BUT I PROBABLY WILL OVER TIME. M: WHAT SATISFIED YOU ABOUT THIS PROJECT? RO: EVERYTHING! BEING ABLE TO PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION OF TRUST WHERE I&#39;M NOT AFRAID THAT THINGS WILL BE MISINTERPRETED OR TRANSLATED THE WRONG WAY. EVERYTHING WENT SO WELL. IT&#39;S VERY SATISFYING TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT ARE CONSIDERED YOUR SUCCESSES IN A SOLID EXHIBITION. WE OFTEN FORGET. WE LIVE IN THE MOMENT. TO SEE ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER IS THRILLING. EVEN MORE SO IN SUCH AN IMPORTANT FASHION VENUE AS THE PALAIS GALLIERA. M: WHY DID YOU WANT US TO SEARCH YOUR ROOM AT THE END OF THE EXHIBITION? RO: INITIALLY, I ASKED ALEXANDRE SAMSON: &quot;WHAT&#39;S YOUR WISH LIST FOR THIS PROJECT?&quot; HE REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE BEGINNING OF THE BRAND FROM THE PERIOD LIVED ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. WE DIDN&#39;T HAVE MANY ARCHIVES OR RECORDS, SO WE HAD TO DO SOME RESEARCH. THIS SPACE TRULY REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF THE FURNITURE COLLECTION. THIS BED IS THE FIRST PIECE MICHÈLE LAMY AND I REALLY BUILT TOGETHER. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD IT IN ALABASTER, IN FELT. IT WAS REALLY THE HEART OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AFTERWARD. IT&#39;S ALSO TO EMPHASIZE THE IDEA THAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A CONSTANT STORY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. AND TO MAKE IT AS PERSONAL AS POSSIBLE, I SUPPOSE. I NEVER DREAMED THIS BIG. M: YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMAGINATIVE MEN OUT THERE, THOUGH! RO: IN MY CHILDHOOD (IT&#39;S NOT LIKE WE ALWAYS TRAVELED) IT WASN&#39;T AN OPTION. SO, I REALLY HAD TO FORCE MYSELF, BECAUSE EXPLORING AND EXPERIMENTING WERE NOT IN MY NATURE. THERE WAS FEAR, CAUTION, AND SHAME IN ME, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I LIVED IN A SMALL CONSERVATIVE TOWN. I REMEMBER MORE OF A GENERAL OPPRESSIVE STATE. I ALWAYS COMPLAIN ABOUT MY FATHER&#39;S STRICTNESS, BUT HE ALSO HAD AN IMMENSE LIBRARY AND A MAGNIFICENT KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC. IT&#39;S THANKS TO HIM THAT I KNEW PROUST AS A CHILD. I DIDN&#39;T REALLY READ HIM, BUT HIS NOVELS WERE PRESENT IN HIS LIBRARY. I STUDIED HIM IN A WAY. IN MY OPINION, HE WAS THE PINNACLE OF FIN-DE-SIÈCLE GLAMOUR. AS AN AMERICAN, I INTERPRETED MY FASCINATION WITH EUROPEAN COMPLEXITY AND THE DENSITY OF PARISIAN GLAMOUR&#39;S LAYERS. THEN, I REDUCED IT TO A CRUDE AMERICAN CARICATURE. I THINK THAT&#39;S PART OF MY METHOD. M: WHY ARE YOU SELLING A TOOTHBRUSH IN THE EXHIBITION SHOP? RO: WHY NOT! THERE&#39;S MOUTHWASH, TOOTHPASTE, A TOOTHBRUSH, AND MOUTH SPRAY. I WROTE A STORY ABOUT MY DAILY LIFE IN A MAGAZINE IN WHICH I SAID: &quot;I BRUSH MY TEETH WITH SELAHATTIN TOOTHPASTE BECAUSE I LOVE THEIR PACKAGING,&quot; WHICH WAS TRUE. THEN, ON INSTAGRAM, I SAW A SELAHATTIN AD WITH MY BLURRED FACE AND MY QUOTE OVER IT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS BOLD. I CONTACTED THEM AND COMPLIMENTED THEM ON THEIR CHEEKINESS. I TOLD THEM: &quot;WE SHOULD DO A COLLABORATION!&quot; THAT&#39;S HOW WE GOT HERE. I LOVE THE DESIGNER. THE REASON HE CREATED HIS BRAND IS THAT HE HAD A STROKE. DURING HIS RECOVERY, HE WANTED THE MOST ESSENTIAL THINGS AROUND HIM TO BE MAGNIFIED. I ALSO BELIEVE IN THE IDEA THAT YOU DON&#39;T NEED TO HAVE MANY THINGS, BUT THAT ESSENTIAL THINGS SHOULD BE MADE SPECIAL. M: CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THESE GIGANTIC TABLES? RO: THESE TABLES ARE FACSIMILES OF THE TABLE I HAD IN THE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD STUDIO. AT THE TIME, THESE TABLES WERE MADE FROM WOOD FOUND IN THE STREET. THE STUDIO ONLY HAD ONE TABLE, AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS PHOTO. THERE WAS A MANNEQUIN HANGING OVER IT. HERE, WE MADE TWO WITH INTEGRATED LIGHT TO SHOW ALL THE DOCUMENTS ARRANGED ON THEM. WHEN WE MOVED, WE LEFT THE TABLE THERE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO IT SINCE. M: ARE YOU A NOSTALGIC PERSON? RO: YES, I CONSIDER MYSELF VERY NOSTALGIC. M: WHAT&#39;S YOUR FAVORITE PART OF THIS EXHIBITION? RO: THERE&#39;S A JACKET THAT LEMARIÉ MADE WITH HAND-TIED OSTRICH FEATHERS. IT&#39;S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS. AND FOR SOME REASON, MICHÈLE (LAMY) CAN&#39;T STAND THEM. SHE HATES FEATHERS.

THE SPRAWLING SHOWCASE EXUDES MANY MOODS, FROM THE MAJESTY OF COUTURE-LIKE DRESSES AND CAPES PYRAMIDICALLY ARRANGED IN SOARING FELT NICHES, ONE REMINISCENT OF THE HOOVER DAM, TO THE GLEEFUL DEPRAVITY OF A LIFE-LIKE STATUE OF OWENS URINATING INTO A METAL TROUGH ALONGSIDE VIDEO FOOTAGE OF OTHER KINKY ACTIVITIES. ALEXANDRE SAMSON, HEAD OF COLLECTIONS AT GALLIERA AND SCIENTIFIC CURATOR OF THE “TEMPLE OF LOVE” SHOW, NAMED AFTER A SISTERS OF MERCY SONG, HAS DELICATELY TITLED THAT ROOM “THE JOY OF DECADENCE.” “BEHIND THE SCENES, OUR WORKING TEAM HAS CALLED IT ‘PISS CHAPEL,’” OWENS SAID NONCHALANTLY ABOUT THE DISPLAY. “IT HAS ALL THE MORE PROVOCATIVE THINGS. AND A WARNING SIGN.” TO BE SURE, OWENS SUGARCOATS NOTHING, HIS EARNESTNESS FELT IN THE HALTING FRENCH HE VOICED FOR THE AUDIO VOICEOVER IN ONE ROOM; IN THE RECREATION OF THE MODEST BEDROOM HE SHARED WITH HIS WIFE AND MUSE MICHÈLE LAMY BACK IN HIS EARLY L.A. DAYS, AND IN THE HOURLONG IPHONE VIDEO OF HIM DRAPING A MEN’S LOOK FROM SHEARLING AND SWEATSHIRT MATERIAL THAT TURNED OUT MARVELOUSLY — MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT. THE OWENS TAKEOVER OF GALLIERA EXTENDS TO THE BUILDING’S WEDDING-CAKE-LIKE BEAUX-ARTS EXTERIOR, WHERE HE COVERED CLASSICAL STATUARY WITH TOTEM-LIKE CAPED FIGURES COVERED IN BROWN SEQUINS, INSTALLED BRUTALIST SCULPTURES IN THE COURTYARD BASED ON HIS “PRONG” SEATING, AND COLLABORATED WITH SWEDISH ORAL CARE BRAND SELAHATIN ON BOAR-HAIR TOOTHBRUSHES FOR THE GIFT SHOP. (THESE MARRY CAVEMAN AND MINIMALIST AESTHETICS, A TYPICAL OWENS SLEIGHT OF HAND.) IN TWO OTHER FIRSTS FOR THE MUSEUM, HE HELPED CURATE PLANTINGS IN ITS GARDENS, INSISTING ON MORNING GLORIES AND HE AND LAMY STYLED THE WAITERS AND BREAD BASKETS AT ITS OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT. THE EXHIBITION LAYS BARE ALL HIS FOREVER INSPIRATIONS — 1930S GLAMOUR, THE BIBLICAL EPICS OF CECIL B. DEMILLE, “METROPOLIS,” THE JUGENDSTIL ART MOVEMENT, AND JOSEPH BEUYS AMONG THEM — ALONG WITH THE INCENDIARY, UNDERGROUND CHARACTERS HE’S DRAWN TO, FROM “TRANS-PLEGIC” HOLLYWOOD DRAG QUEEN GODDESS BUNNY TO COURTNEY LOVE, WHO CONTRIBUTED A RAMBLING HOMAGE FOR THE EXHIBITION CATALOGUE. “I’M STILL PROMOTING THE VALUES THAT I’VE ALWAYS PROMOTED ‚ PROMOTING FLEXIBILITY IN AESTHETICS TO ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE WHO DON’T SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THE VERY STRICT AND CRUEL STANDARDS THAT WE LIVE WITH,” OWENS MUSED. THE DESIGNER IS LISTED AS ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE EXHIBITION, WHICH RUNS THROUGH JAN. 4, 2026, AND HE LEFT LOTS OF ROPE TO THE OTHER CURATORS WITH THE PROVISO THAT HIS INTENTIONS NOT BE MISCONSTRUED. “I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDER ME ALL TRANSGRESSION ALL THE TIME AND THAT’S FINE, BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO REALLY LIKE ME ANYWAY,” HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW, PART OF IT CONDUCTED DURING A CAR RIDE TO THE MUSEUM. “BUT IF I WERE JUST ALL TRANSGRESSION ALL THE TIME, I WOULDN’T HAVE LASTED THIS LONG. THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF QUALITY AND SOPHISTICATION FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST IN OR BELIEVE. AND I FEEL LIKE I’VE GIVEN ENOUGH OF THAT.” SAMSON RANKS OWENS ALONGSIDE DESIGNERS LIKE REI KAWAKUBO OF COMME DES GARÇONS, MADAME GRÈS AND CRISTÓBAL BALENCIAGA, WHO DESIGNED VIA PATTERNS AND DRAPING, NOT SKETCHING. “RICK GOES IMMEDIATELY TO THE FABRIC AND TO THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL ASPECT OF THE CLOTHES. AND THAT MAKES HIM VERY DIFFERENT,” HE SAID, ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THE CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, WHERE NARROW FISHTAIL SKIRTS RECUR AND RECUR, ALONG WITH HUMBLE COLORS LIKE DUST BROWN, GRAY, IVORY AND BLACK. “IT FELT IMPORTANT TO ME RIGHT NOW TO SHOWCASE A WORK OF AN INDEPENDENT DESIGNER WITH A VERY SPECIAL VISION, VERY TRUE TO HIMSELF,” HE SAID. “IT’S REASSURING PROOF THAT YOU CAN BE DIFFERENT AND THAT IT CAN WORK AS A BUSINESS.” THE EXHIBITION’S MAIN ROOMS ARE DEDICATED TO HIS HOLLYWOOD YEARS AND HIS PARIS CAREER, WHERE HE’S BECOME ONE OF THE FASHION CAPITAL’S CONSUMMATE SHOWMEN, INCORPORATING SMOKE BOMBS AND OTHER PYROTECHNICS INTO HIS SHOWS. THE AMERICAN DESIGNER ADMITS THAT WHEN HE FIRST STARTED OUT, HE FAVORED “A VERY DESTROYED LOOK” AS HIS MAIN FASHION STATEMENT. THE EXHIBITION INCLUDES VERY EARLY DESIGNS MADE FROM DECAYING FABRICS. “AND THAT WAS AN OBVIOUSLY ADOLESCENT REACTION TO THE STATUS QUO, AND IT WAS A GESTURE OF CONTEMPT. WE SEE THIS CYCLE HAPPENING, AND IT’S A VALID ONE….EVERY GENERATION REJECTS THE ONE BEFORE IT. BUT AS I GREW OLDER, I FELT THAT REJECTION WAS NOT ENOUGH. I NEEDED TO CONTRIBUTE. I COULDN’T JUST COMPLAIN. “SO THE WAY I DRESS NOW IS VERY DIFFERENT, BECAUSE NOW IT’S BLACK AND VERY TAILORED AND VERY SHARP, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE WORLD IS SO CHAOTIC AND MESSY THAT I LIKE TO INJECT A LITTLE NOTE OF FORMALITY, AND FORMALITY IMPLIES POLITENESS,” HE EXPLAINED. AMONG THE 100 OUTFITS ON DISPLAY ARE SOME BOMBASTIC, KITE-LIKE CONTRAPTIONS, BULBOUS PILEUPS OF FABRIC DONUTS, AND A CHEWBACCA-ESQUE CAPE-CUM-SARCOPHOGUS. YET HIS MORE SINUOUS, SCULPTURAL DESIGNS RADIATE GLAMOUR, ROMANCE AND AN OTHERWORLDLY REGALNESS. OWENS WAS THE SUBJECT OF A RETROSPECTIVE IN 2017 AT THE TRIENNALE DESIGN MUSEUM IN MILAN. “IT TURNED OUT VERY BOMBASTIC,” HE SAID OF THAT SHOWCASE, WHICH WAS PUNCTUATED BY A GARGANTUAN INTESTINE OF BLACK SLUDGE THAT UNDULATED ITS WAY THROUGH THE BUILDING. “I THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL. BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, NEXT TIME, IF I EVER GET THE CHANCE TO DO THIS AGAIN, I WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE DELICATE AND MORE FOCUSING ON THE CRAFT. “EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ROLLING THEIR EYES AT MY PROVOCATIONS, I THINK THIS WILL SATISFY THEIR NEED FOR QUALITY — AT LEAST I HOPE SO,” HE ADDED. BESIDES THE MESMERIZING DRAPING VIDEO, VISITORS CAN MARVEL AT SCULPTURAL TOPS OF GLASS BEADS THAT EVOKE FRANK GEHRY ARCHITECTURE, DELICATE MILLEFEUILLE TOPS MADE OF FISH LEATHER, SCREEN-SIREN GOWNS GALORE AND HIS FIGURE-HUGGING LEATHER JACKETS, A STRIP OF KNITWEAR EMBEDDED IN THE SLEEVES FOR A SLEEKER FIT. OWENS ONCE MUSED THAT HE’LL PROBABLY BE REMEMBERED FOR DROOPY SHORTS, LONG T-SHIRTS AND FUNKY SNEAKERS — AMONG MENSWEAR DESIGNS ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACED BY HYPE BEASTS AND TECH ENTREPRENEURS. HE’S ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH THAT, THOUGH THE EXHIBITION MOSTLY SPOTLIGHTS THE GRACEFUL ALLURE OF HIS WAIST-CONSCIOUS TAILORING AND DRESSES FOR WOMEN, AND THE SUPERHERO QUALITY EMBEDDED IN HIS COATS AND CAPES FOR MEN. IN HER CATALOGUE ENTRY, LOVE RECALLS HAPPENING UPON OWENS DURING A MAGAZINE RUN, WATCHING HIM WORK “LIKE A SCORCERER” ON BURLAP T-SHIRTS AND FELT SKIRTS THE COLOR OF DUST, WHICH SHE HASTILY BOUGHT, FINDING THEM “SO ORIGINAL AND COOL.” SHE MARVELED AT HIS SUCCESS, AND APPLAUDED THAT HE MAINTAINED HIS INDEPENDENCE. “THERE WAS ALWAYS LOGIC BEHIND WHAT YOU DID,” SHE SAID. INDEED, THE DESIGNER’S INTENTIONS ARE BASED ON HIGH IDEALS — KINDNESS, TOLERANCE AND HUMILITY AMONG THEM — EVEN IF HIS METHODS CAN SOMETIME SHOCK. FOR EXAMPLE, HIS SO-CALLED “FREE WILLY” MENSWEAR SHOW, WHERE MODELS’ PENISES WERE VISIBLE VIA PEEPHOLES ON HIS CLOTHES, WAS TO POKE FUN AT PRUDISHNESS, GIVEN HOW NAKED STATUARY IN PUBLIC PARKS NEVER RAISES AN EYEBROW. “I WILL BE DOING TRANSGRESSION TILL THE DAY I DIE, BECAUSE THAT IS MY PROTEST,” HE SAID. “IT IS A RESPONSE TO THE PRISSY MORALISM AND JUDGMENT THAT I SEE IN THE WORLD. IT IS MY WAY OF SAYING, ‘LIGHTEN UP, DON’T TAKE IT ALL SO SERIOUSLY.’ A LITTLE BIT OF WICKED FUN IS ELEGANT. HUMOR, SELF-DEPRECATION AND BEING ABLE TO LAUGH AT YOURSELF IS THE MOST ELEGANT THING THERE IS.” WITH HIS PENCHANT FOR MENACING MODELS, BLACK-OUT CONTACT LENSES AND JUTTING SHOULDERS, OWENS IS ALSO A FOREVER TORCHBEARER FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEAUTY, AND A SAFE HAVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO FEEL PERSECUTED FOR BEING OUTSIDE THE NORM. THE DESIGNER HAD HIS EPIPHANY AS A TEENAGER RUMMAGING THROUGH THE DISCOUNT RECORD BINS IN THE BASEMENT OF K-MART, WHEN HE HAPPENED UPON DAVID BOWIE’S “DIAMOND DOGS” ALBUM, WHICH DEPICTED HIM NAKED AS A HALF-MAN, HALF-DOG HYBRID. (IT’S INCLUDED IN ONE OF THE TABLE DISPLAYS.) “I JUST REMEMBER FEELING FLUSHED WITH EMBARRASSMENT, BUT ALSO EXCITED,” HE RECALLED. “IT WAS A MOMENT WHERE, AS A SMALL-TOWN SISSY, I SAW SOMEWHERE I COULD GO. I SAW SOMEWHERE SOMETHING I COULD BE. I SAW A VISION OF THIS GROTESQUE GLAMOUR THAT I COULD CONNECT TO, AND IT WAS SO LIBERATING.” OWENS NOW HAS THE CONFIDENCE TO WALK AROUND PARIS IN HIS FRANKENSTEIN-SHOULDERED TAILORING, SEQUINS AND HIGH-HEELED BOOTS. HE RECALLED ONE NIGHT BEING GLAMMED UP AND WALKING TO AN EVENT WITH HIS PROTÉGÉ TYRONE SUSMAN, AND MAKING A SMALL DETOUR THROUGH A SMALL, GROTTO-LIKE PARK HE APPRECIATES, ONLY TO ENCOUNTER A SINISTER-LOOKING GANG OF YOUTHS. “I’M LIKE, F–K, I’M 60 YEARS OLD. I MEAN, LIKE, WHO’S GONNA TRY AND BEAT ME UP ANYMORE?” HE RECALLED. “AND WE HAD TO WALK PAST THEM TO GET THROUGH. LO AND BEHOLD THEY LOOKED UP AND CALLED OUT, ‘HEY, RICK OWENS!’ IT WAS THE CUTEST THING. IT WAS SO SATISFYING.” Bag Shipping to United States Contacts Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Terms of Use Eco-Aware Newsletter Cookie Preferences Social Media OWENSCORP ITALIA SPA , VIA M.

A MEDITATION ON A SINGULAR CAREER, IT SPANS THE ICONOCLASTIC DESIGNER’S LOS ANGELES BEGINNINGS ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD TO THE PRESENT DAY, FEATURING OVER 100 OF HIS SILHOUETTES, WHICH OFTEN DEFY CATEGORISATION BUT ARE ENTIRELY HIS OWN. SPILLING OVER TO THE EXTERIOR, MONOLITHIC STATUES ON PALAIS GALLIERA’S FAÇADE ARE DRAPED IN SEQUINNED FABRIC. THE GARDEN IS STUDDED WITH 30 BRUTALIST-STYLE CEMENT SCULPTURES REFERENCING HIS FURNITURE CREATION, AND, FOR THE DURATION OF THE RETROSPECTIVE, RICK OWENS HAS HAD THE GARDEN LANDSCAPED WITH ALL-BLUE FLOWERS, INCLUDING HIS CALIFORNIAN FAVOURITES, MORNING GLORIES. PREVIEWING AFTER HIS S/S 2026 RUNWAY SHOW AT PALAIS DE TOKYO THIS EVENING (26 JUNE) – JUST ACROSS THE ROAD – AT THE EXHIBITION’S HEART IS THE IDEA OF LOVE. ‘I FELT THAT LOVE IS THE BEST WORD TO PUT OUT THERE,’ HE SAYS. ‘MAYBE IT’LL HELP MANIFEST SOMETHING.’ RICK OWENS TAKES OVER PALAIS GALLIERA WITH A SUBVERSIVE, MULTI-MEDIA SURVEY OF HIS LIFE’S WORK WALLPAPER: THIS IS YOUR SECOND RETROSPECTIVE, THE FIRST, ‘SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN’, WAS AT LA TRIENNALE DI MILANO IN 2017. RICK OWENS: AT THE TIME, IT WAS WONDERFUL TO BE ACCEPTED BY A CULTURAL INSTITUTION AT THE TOP OF ITS GAME. WHILE I WAS DOING IT, I THOUGHT, ‘WOW, THIS IS AMAZING! NOBODY GETS TO WRITE THEIR OWN OBITUARY THIS WAY.’ BUT I ONLY DID IT BECAUSE I WAS ALLOWED TO BE IN COMPLETE CONTROL; I DIDN’T WANT ANYBODY INTERPRETING ME. W: TWO RETROSPECTIVES IN EIGHT YEARS IS A LOT OF INTROSPECTION. HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT? RO: THAT MILAN SHOW WAS WHERE I USED THE PHRASE ‘I WOULD LAY A BLACK GLITTERING TURD ON THE WHITE LANDSCAPE OF CONFORMITY’ AND IT WAS VERY THAT. SO I THOUGHT, IF I EVER DO ANOTHER SHOW, I WOULD DO A SOFTER ONE THAT FOCUSES MORE ON THE BEGINNINGS, THE CRAFT SIDE. THE URGENCY TO CONTROL WASN&#39;T AS INTENSE. IT’S MORE HUMBLE AND MORE RAW, THERE&#39;S A LOT MORE FOCUS ON THE LA STUDIO EXPERIENCE. MICHÈLE [LAMY, OWENS’ WIFE] KEPT TELLING ME, ‘YOU GOTTA STOP CALLING IT A RETROSPECTIVE!’ SHE DOESN&#39;T LIKE THE FINALITY – I&#39;M LEANING INTO IT! A RETROSPECTIVE IMPLIES A DECLINE, IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT LEGACY AND MORTALITY AND AGEING, AND HOW LONG DO YOU STAY RELEVANT, AND HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT? I DON&#39;T HAVE THE ANSWERS TO ANY OF THOSE THINGS, BUT I AM THINKING ABOUT THEM AND ADDRESSING THEM PUBLICLY. W: WHY THE THEME OF LOVE? RO: I FELT THAT LOVE IS THE BEST WORD TO PUT OUT THERE. MAYBE IT&#39;LL HELP MANIFEST SOMETHING. PEOPLE GET THE IMPRESSION THAT I AM THIS DYSTOPIAN DISRUPTOR, AND THAT I AM AGGRESSIVE, BUT MY MOTIVATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO BE A CONTRAST TO THE CONDEMNING JUDGMENT THAT I EXPERIENCED IN MY YOUTH, AND THAT I HAVE DECLARED WAR ON. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CREATORS LIKE ME WHO ARE CHEERFULLY DEPRAVED, AND THAT IS MY RESPONSE TO ALL WHO FELT CONTEMPT OR OPPRESSION, AND I&#39;M PUTTING THE OPPOSITE OF THAT OUT THERE IN MY OWN LITTLE WAY. W: YOU’VE BEEN CALLED THE DARK PRINCE OF FASHION, THE PROPHET OF THE APOCALYPSE… YET, YOU ACCEPT PEOPLE WITH LOVING KINDNESS, IT FEELS CONTRADICTORY. RO: IT&#39;S LOVELY TO BE CALLED THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS – I LOVE A SINISTER EDGE. THIS IS A TOOL THAT PEOPLE HAVE USED TO ADDRESS THE DISCOMFORT OF FEAR OR POWERLESSNESS. I’M JUST A FUN PART OF A SUBSET OF AESTHETICS THAT HAS EXISTED FOREVER. AND THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF MY MOTIVATING URGES, TO PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PREVAILING CULTURAL AESTHETICS THAT CAN SEEM VERY NARROW AND A LITTLE BIT CRUEL. I PROPOSE OPTIONS THAT STRETCH THAT A LITTLE BIT. THAT&#39;S WHY I HAVE PROBABLY BEEN REFERRED TO AS A DARK DESIGNER, BECAUSE I TRY TO ADDRESS EVERYTHING. W: IS THERE ANY PROVOCATION IN THIS GENTLE, LOVING RETROSPECTIVE? RO: A LITTLE BIT! CONDEMNING JUDGMENT IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY PRISSINESS AND SQUEAMISHNESS, I ROLL MY EYES AT THIS. I LIKE VERY SIMPLE PROVOCATION, WITH GENUINE INNOCENCE, AND I THINK IT&#39;S CHEERFUL. AND IF SOMEBODY&#39;S CLUTCHING THEIR PEARLS, LET THEM CLUTCH! WHEN THERE CAN BE SUCH CRUEL FORCES IN THE WORLD, A LITTLE BIT OF GIDDINESS IS NOT THE WORST THING. THIS SHOW IS BOMBASTIC BECAUSE I JUST CAN&#39;T HELP IT. W: YOU LIVE BETWEEN PARIS, VENICE AND LA. HAS PARIS BECOME HOME? RO: I LOVE PARIS. ITALY IS WHERE I HAVE THE QUIET TO CREATE, WITH A LOT OF SUPPORT; PARIS IS WHERE I’M JUDGED. I LIKE THAT. I HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCCASION IN PARIS. RECENTLY, I REALISED I&#39;VE BEEN HERE FOR 20 YEARS, THIS IS WHERE I FEEL THE MOST SECURE, AND I SAID, ‘OK, SO I’M GOING TO GET OLD IN PARIS!’ I LOVE WHAT I’M DOING, I’VE REACHED THIS GREAT LEVEL, AND I HAVE A VERY NICE RHYTHM IN MY LIFE – I WORK A LOT, WHICH I LOVE, AND I TAKE A NAP EVERY DAY TO GIVE MY BRAIN A BREAK, AND I WORK OUT FOR AN HOUR EVERY EVENING. IT IS AMAZING TO HAVE A WONDERFUL SENSE OF PURPOSE. THEN I THOUGHT: ‘WHAT, AT 63 YEARS OLD, IS THE MOST SATISFYING THING THAT I COULD BE DOING WITH MY LIFE?’ AND THAT WAS WHEN WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE RETROSPECTIVE. W: WORKING OUT IS WORKING OUT FOR YOU, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC. RO: IT’S JUST ABOUT TRYING TO DO THE BEST WITH WHAT YOU’VE GOT. WORKING OUT IS MODERN COUTURE! NO OUTFIT IS GOING TO MAKE YOU LOOK AS GOOD AS YOU WILL FEEL WITH A GOOD BODY. SO BUY LESS CLOTHES AND GO WORK OUT. IT’LL SATISFY YOUR VANITY IN A WAY THAT CLOTHES JUST CAN’T. W: HOW WAS WORKING WITH THE PALAIS GALLIERA? RO: I WENT TO SO MANY EXQUISITE SHOWS AT THE GALLIERA; HOW THEY PUT THINGS TOGETHER WAS SO ADMIRABLE, SO PRECISE, SO BEAUTIFULLY DOCUMENTED, I WAS MORE OPEN TO SUGGESTION HERE, BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THEIR PERSPECTIVE. SO I&#39;VE BEEN WORKING WITH HEAD OF COLLECTIONS ALEXANDRE SAMSON – I’M A HUGE FAN OF HIS. FOCUSING ON THE STUDIO EXPERIENCE WHEN WE STARTED WAS ALEXANDRE’S IDEA. IT WASN’T EASY, I HAVE SO FEW ARCHIVES FROM BACK THEN. WE DIDN’T THINK ABOUT ARCHIVES, WE THOUGHT ABOUT SURVIVAL – ‘LET’S SELL ANYTHING WE CAN!’ W: THAT WAS IN PRE-DIGITAL 1994, YOU WERE WORKING WITH SKETCHES AND SWATCHES? RO: YEAH, WE HAD TO SEARCH FOR STUFF, AND ALEXANDRE’S LIKE A DETECTIVE, HE UNEARTHED AMAZING THINGS. W: YOU RECREATED YOUR HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD BEDROOM WITH ARMY SURPLUS FELT WALLS, COMPLETE WITH THE BED YOU AND MICHÈLE SLEPT IN. WHY? RO: THE BEDROOM IS PROBABLY THE KERNEL OF OUR FURNITURE COLLECTION BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST EVER BED WE BUILT FOR OURSELVES, AND IT WAS VERY REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR FURNITURE AND OF THAT TIME. I THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE SENTIMENTAL, NOSTALGIC THING TO INCLUDE. W: ARE YOU FASCINATED BY LAST SEASON’S FASHION MUSICAL CHAIRS, JONATHAN [ANDERSON] AND MATTHIEU [BLAZY] AND PIERPAOLO [PICCIOLI] AND DEMNA? RO: ISN’T IT CRAZY? THERE IS AN ARTIFICIAL DESPERATION TO IT ALL. I DON&#39;T MEAN TO GLOAT, BUT IN A WEIRD WAY, IT JUST KIND OF SOLIDIFIES MY POSITION; IT ALLOWS ME TO BE MORE ME. W: WILL YOU ALWAYS REMAIN INDEPENDENT? RO: I DON&#39;T MIND THAT WE’RE A SMALL GROUP THAT DOESN&#39;T HAVE THE RESOURCES OF MAJOR GROUPS, IT MAKES YOU MORE INVENTIVE. I LIKE THAT PUZZLE, HAVING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES – HOW DO YOU MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING COMPELLING? AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PICASSO, YOU&#39;RE THINKING, YEAH, IT CAN BE DONE. I’M NOT COMPARING WHAT I DO TO PICASSO, BUT I&#39;M SAYING THAT IT IS A GREAT LESSON OF RESTRAINT AND POWER FROM REDUCED MATERIALS AND REDUCED ELEMENTS. W: I FEEL LIKE FASHION HASN’T REPLACED ART, BUT IT’S KIND OF UP THERE. RO: I TAKE FASHION VERY SERIOUSLY. CLOTHES ARE POWERFUL TOOLS OF COMMUNICATION, AND WE WERE PUT ON EARTH TO COMMUNICATE. IN FASHION, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOUR AUDIENCE, WHO FEELS SOME KIND OF INTEGRITY, SOME KIND OF PERSONALITY, SOME KIND OF TRUTH, FOUR TIMES A YEAR, YEAR AFTER YEAR, WITH A COMPELLING, RELEVANT MESSAGE, TO MAINTAIN THIS CONNECTION. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I SEE THAT IN ART. W*: WILL YOU EVER STOP? RO: NEVER. I WOULDN&#39;T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF! I WOULD BE LOST WITHOUT IT. IT’S THE SCAFFOLDING OF MY LIFE. I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO CONNECT WITH THE WORLD AROUND ME. I’VE SENT OUT A MESSAGE AND RECEIVED A POSITIVE RESPONSE. WHAT COULD BE MORE PROFOUNDLY SATISFYING THAN THAT? I KNOW THAT I&#39;M SO LUCKY. IT’S A MIRACLE. I&#39;M COMPLETELY SURPRISED THAT I GOT THIS FAR.

O’FLAHERTY AHEAD OF HIS PALAIS GALLIERA EXHIBITION, OWENS DISCUSSES HIS MUSICAL INFLUENCES—FROM ENGLISH ROCK TO CHER AND CHARLI XCX. RICK OWENS IS A MOOD—A SOUND AS MUCH AS A LOOK. SOMETIMES HIS CLOTHES ARE A SEDUCTION, OTHER TIMES, THEY’RE AN ASSAULT. THE SAME COLLECTION CAN CONJURE THE DANCE FLOOR AT BERGHAIN, WITH MESSY S&amp;M CUTS AND WEATHERED LEATHER, AND A GRAND OPERA, WITH DUST-COLORED GOWNS DRAPED LIKE CLASSIC MADAME GRÉS FROM THE 1930S. OWENS, WHO GREW UP IN A DEVOUTLY CATHOLIC FAMILY IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, STARTED HIS LABEL IN LOS ANGELES, IN 1994, WITH HIS LIFE PARTNER, MICHÈLE LAMY. MUSIC HAS BEEN KEY TO THEIR EVERY COLLECTION AND SIDE PROJECT, INCLUDING THE COUPLE’S BRUTALIST FURNITURE, WHICH IS EXHIBITED IN GALLERIES AND SOLD AS FINE ART. OWENS NAMED HIS SIGNATURE LEATHER BIKER’S JACKET AFTER THE STOOGES, HIS MAXED-OUT TAKE ON CONVERSE AFTER THE RAMONES, AND OFTEN COLLABORATES WITH MUSICIANS, LIKE THE QUEER RAPPER ZEBRA KATZ AND RADICAL DRAG ARTIST CHRISTEENE. THIS WEEK, A MONUMENTAL EXHIBITION OF OWENS’ LIFE AND WORK OPENS AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA, IN PARIS. TITLED “TEMPLE OF LOVE,” AFTER A SONG BY SISTERS OF MERCY, THE EXHIBITION INCLUDES OVER 100 OUTFITS HE’S MADE OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES, ALONG WITH VIDEOS AND MEMENTOS FROM HIS PERSONAL ARCHIVE. AND, OF COURSE, THE MUSIC THAT’S INFLUENCED HIM. BELOW, OWENS DISCUSSES HOW HIS LIFE AND WORK ALWAYS COMES WITH A SOUNDTRACK. THE EXHIBITION TITLE COMES FROM A SONG BY A 1980S ENGLISH ROCK BAND. WHAT MADE THAT PARTICULAR TRACK SO SIGNIFICANT? I HAD USED ANOTHER OF THEIR SONGS, “LIGHTS,” FOR THE STROBE [MEN’S FALL-WINTER] SHOW IN 2022. SHOES AND MUSIC ARE THE STARTING POINTS TO BUILD EVERY COLLECTION, BECAUSE BOTH TAKE SO LONG TO CREATE. WITH THE MUSIC, I LIKE TO EASE PEOPLE INTO THE SHOW. IT HAS TO BE MEDITATIVE, AND THEN SOMETHING CLOSE TO ECSTATIC OR [A] RESOLUTION AT THE END. I HAD REACHED OUT TO ANDREW ELDRITCH OF THE BAND ABOUT USING “LIGHTS” BECAUSE IT HAD MEANT A LOT TO ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. HE HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO, BECAUSE HE NEVER LIKED THE PRODUCTION ON IT, AND IT’S FROM SUCH A LONG TIME AGO. BUT WE DID A RAPTUROUS MIX WHICH PLAYED OVER THE MOST RIDICULOUS COLLECTION, SHOWN WITH HUGE EGYPTIAN-STYLE HELMETS THAT HAD DAN FLAVIN KIND OF LIGHTS ON THE TOP. SO OVER THE TOP AND CAMP, BUT DELICIOUS. WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE EXHIBITION IN PARIS, I WAS INVITED TO DO SOMETHING TO THE FAÇADE OF THE MUSEUM, AND I WAS GOING TO WRAP THE STATUES IN FRONT OF THE MUSEUM, BUT IT FELT RUDE TO DO THAT—AND ALSO AWKWARD DURING WARTIME. SO, I HAVE PUT SEQUIN SLIP COVERS ON THEM. THEY WILL LOOK ART DECO. THE WORKING TITLE FOR THEM WAS “THE SISTERS OF MERCY” BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE STOIC NUNS. THE NAME STUCK, THEN I THOUGHT… TEMPLE OF LOVE. FOR THE EXHIBITION, YOU RECREATED THE BEDROOM YOU SHARED WITH LAMY ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IN THE 1990S, AROUND THE TIME YOU STARTED THE BRAND. THE BED LOOKS LIKE A PAGAN ALTAR. WHAT MUSIC WAS PLAYING IN THAT ROOM BACK THEN? SISTERS OF MERCY, OF COURSE. AND A LOT OF MARLENA DIETRICH, VELVET UNDERGROUND, AND LOU REED. THE REALLY DARK LOU REED? LIKE THE ALBUM BERLIN, WITH THE CANDLELIGHT, DUBONNET ON ICE, DRUGS, SUICIDE, AND CHILDREN SCREAMING? OH YES. WE PLAYED “SAD SONG” FROM THAT ALBUM A LOT. AND ALL OF CONEY ISLAND BABY, BLASTING OUT ON CASSETTE. THAT ROOM WAS ALSO THE FIRST PLACE WE MADE FURNITURE TOGETHER. HOW ELSE HAS MUSIC SHAPED YOUR ENVIRONMENT? THERE ARE THREE BLACK AND WHITE ALBUM COVERS THAT I’VE ALWAYS LOVED AS A TRIPTYCH AND HAVE ON MY WALL: THE IDIOT BY IGGY POP, KLAUS NOMI, AND HEROES BY DAVID BOWIE. I LOVE THE WAY IGGY IS POINTING ONE WAY AND BOWIE THE OTHER, AND THERE’S NOMI IN THE MIDDLE IN HIS BAUHAUS MONOCHROME LOOK. I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE COVERS TOGETHER, IN MY OFFICE, AND MADE A PRINT, WHICH CAME OUT WITH A WONDERFUL WHITE STREAK ACROSS IT. THAT’S GOING INTO THE CATALOGUE FOR THE SHOW. I’M PUTTING THE GRAPHIC ON FIVE OR TEN PIECES THIS WEEK FOR THE [SPRING/SUMMER 2026 MEN’S] RUNWAY SHOW. WE DON’T HAVE THE RIGHTS TO THE IMAGES, BUT THEY FIT SO WELL WITH THE COLLECTION. WE PROBABLY CAN’T SELL THEM, BUT I’LL JUST GIVE THEM AWAY AS GIFTS. WHAT’S YOUR WORKOUT MUSIC? I’M LISTENING TO A LOT OF BRUTALISMUS 3000 TO WORK OUT TO RIGHT NOW, AND A TRACK BY BASSTROLOGE FROM 2021, WHICH SAMPLES “SOMEBODY TO LOVE” BY JEFFERSON AIRPLANE. ALSO “GIRL, SO CONFUSING” BY CHARLI XCX. I FOLLOW ANNE IMHOF ON INSTAGRAM, AND SHE USED “365” FEATURING SHYGIRL ON A POST ABOUT REHEARSALS FOR HER SHOW IN LA, AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD. SO, I THOUGHT—AM I MISSING SOMETHING? IF CHARLI IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANNE IMHOF, SHE’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. WHAT’S YOUR MAKE-OUT MUSIC? ALWAYS DISCO. WILL THERE BE A SOUNDSCAPE IN THE EXHIBITION? WHEN YOU FIRST WALK IN, YOU’LL HEAR ME READING FROM JORIS-KARL HUYSMANS’ AGAINST NATURE, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BOOKS I READ FROM MY DAD’S LIBRARY. I NEEDED EXOTICISM GROWING UP AND THAT WAS WHERE I FOUND IT. I’M READING IT OUT IN FRENCH AS PART OF THE AUDIO GUIDE. I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF RECENTLY: WHAT WOULD ENRICH MY LIFE? I’M NEVER GOING TO BUY A YACHT. SO, I DECIDED TO LEARN FRENCH BECAUSE LEARNING SOMETHING IS ENRICHING, AND ALSO, IT’S A GESTURE TO PARIS AND TO THANK THE CITY FOR LETTING ME HAVE THE SHOW. ANYWAY, FOR MY AUDIO GUIDE, I RECITE FROM MY FAVORITE PART OF THE BOOK, WHEN THE HERO JEAN DES ESSEINTES IS DESCRIBING GUSTAVE MOUREAU’S PAINTINGS OF SALOME AND HOW “UNDER THE FRICTION OF HER JANGLING NECKLACES, HER NIPPLES HARDEN.” EXTRAORDINARILY, THAT LINE ISN’T IN THE ENGLISH VERSION OF THE BOOK. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS TRANSLATED WORD FOR WORD, BUT NOT THAT. SO, I’VE CHANGED LITERARY HISTORY BY READING IT IN FRENCH BUT ALSO IN ENGLISH, MURMURING TO YOU AS YOU WALK AROUND THE FIRST ROOM OF THE SHOW. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE OSCAR WILDE PLAY AND THE STRAUSS OPERA ABOUT SALOME. WE HAVE PAINTINGS ON LOAN FROM THE MOREAU MUSEUM FOR THE EXHIBITION. LATER, WHEN YOU GET TO THE ROOM WITH THE STATUE OF ME PISSING, YOU’LL HEAR MONTSERRAT CABALLÉ SINGING THE ARIA FROM SAMSON ET DALILA. YOU ONCE SAID YOU’D LOVE CHER TO PLAY YOU IN A BIOPIC. IS SHE STILL THE ULTIMATE POP STAR FOR YOU? SHE’S SO UNDERRATED. I LISTEN TO A LOT OF THE OLD STUFF. SHE DID AN ALBUM CALLED BITTERSWEET WHITE LIGHT IN 1973 WHICH IS ALL OLD STANDARDS, LIKE “THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY”, AND THEY ARE ALL EXTRAVAGANTLY ORCHESTRATED, AND CAMP, BUT ALSO REALLY EARNEST, ON PAR WITH JUDY GARLAND. RAPTUROUS AND MOVING. YOUR FASHION SHOWS OFTEN HAVE A RITUAL QUALITY TO THEM. IS THE MUSIC A PART OF THAT? IT’S ONLY RECENTLY I’VE STARTED TO USE MUSIC THAT I ONCE CONSIDERED SACRED. I SWITCHED OUT POUNDING TECHNO FOR MAHLER’S SYMPHONY NO.5 FOR A SHOW ON THE DAY UKRAINE WAS INVADED. IT’S SUCH AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF MUSIC, BUT I DIDN’T FEEL I HAD THE AUTHORITY TO USE IT UNTIL THEN. AND IT SUITED THE DAY. INSTEAD OF BEING MANIPULATIVE, IT FELT SOOTHING. I ALSO USED BOWIE’S “WARSZAWA” FOR THE PORTERVILLE SHOW I DID IN MY HOUSE LAST FEBRUARY, WORKING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO AN AESTHETIC—LATEX BOOTS BY STRAYTUKAY IN LONDON, RUBBER GARMENTS WITH MATISSE DI MAGGIO, AND SHOES BY LEO PROTHMAN. USING THE MUSIC FELT SINCERE AND NOT OVERSTEPPING THINGS. I WOULDN’T HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE. AND BECAUSE OF THIS RETROSPECTIVE, I’VE ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE SENTIMENTAL AND NOSTALGIC, AND CONSIDER ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT GOT ME TO WHERE I AM.

RICK OWENS DID A LITTLE MARKET SURVEY BEFORE HIS LATEST MEN’S SHOW. WHAT WERE GUYS INTO? WHETHER THEY WERE STRAIGHT OR GAY, YOUNG OR OLD, BACK CAME THE SAME ANSWER: EVERYTHING BEGAN AND ENDED WITH STRAPS. STRAIGHT GUYS LIKED THE SID VICIOUSNESS OF THEM. GAY GUYS LIKED THE OUTDOORSY CROTCH-CLUTCH OF A CLIMBING STRAP. “STRAPS MEANT NOTHING TO ME,” OWENS BROODED PRE-SHOW. “I THINK THEY’RE A BIT CLICHÉD, AND THAT WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN WHERE I WANTED TO GO. BUT THEY’RE CLEARLY A YOUNG MAN’S GAME, THEY WANT TO TELEGRAPH VITALITY IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN I DO. SO I WAS THINKING, MAYBE I DON’T RECOGNISE WHAT PEOPLE NEED, BUT THAT’S OKAY BECAUSE I’LL ASK AND I’LL KIND OF FIGURE OUT HOW I CAN HELP THEM, OR GIVE THEM MY VERSION. SO THAT’S KIND OF WHAT I’M DOING.” FROM TINY ACORNS COME MIGHTY OAKS. HELPING A GUY OUT WITH HIS LOVE OF OR NEED FOR STRAPS — I’D SAY SECURITY AS MUCH AS VITALITY — BRED A SHOW WHOSE MAJESTIC SCALE WAS ALL BUT AN UNHOLY SACRAMENT, A NEW RELIGION. WATCHING RICK’S MODELS SCALING A ZIGGURAT, STRAPPING THEMSELVES ON SECURELY STEP BY STEP AS THEY CRAWLED TO THE SUMMIT, FELT LIKE AN OUTRÉ METAPHOR FOR MASCULINITY. IT ALSO REMINDED ME OF THE POSTERS FOR THE ZOMBIE SPECTACULAR “28 YEARS LATER” THAT ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD RIGHT NOW, THE CHILD AT THE PINNACLE OF THE BONE TEMPLE. THAT WAS ACTUALLY WHAT OWENS CALLED HIS SHOW: “TEMPLE.” AND RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD IN THE MUSÉE PALAIS GALLIERA, A GLORIOUS OWENS RETROSPECTIVE WAS OPENING. ITS CURATORS HAD DUBBED IT “TEMPLE OF LOVE.” MICHELE LAMY, RICK’S LIFELONG PARTNER IN THE EVOLUTION OF OWENSCORP, WAS MORTIFIED BY THE THOUGHT OF A RETROSPECTIVE. LIKE A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD (HE’S HAD PLENTY OF THOSE TOO), SHE FELT IT REEKED OF FINALITY AND DECLINE. OWENS WAS DELIGHTED TO LEAN INTO THAT IDEA. SO MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS REFERENCED IN THE COURSE OF A CAREER THAT BEGAN OVER THREE DECADES AGO IN THE SLEAZY GLAMOUR OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD HAS BEEN WHIFFED WITH A FIN-DE-SIECLE DECADENCE, AND EVERY STEP ON THAT WAYWARD PATH IS CAPTURED IN “TEMPLE OF LOVE.” OWENS SAW HIS APPROACH AS “A EUROPEAN AESTHETIC FILTERED THROUGH A NAÏVE, CARTOONISH AMERICAN BLUNTNESS.” BUT THE EXHIBITION CLARIFIES A SUBTLETY, A NUANCE, A CONSISTENCY THAT IS ANYTHING BUT BLUNT. OWENS HAS BUILT A FASHION DEMOCRACY IN WHICH ONE LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN WITH A THOUSAND SEDUCTIVE ACCENTS. IT COVERS THE WATERFRONT FROM CEREBRAL TRANSPORT TO THE BASEST HUMAN APPETITES (CELEBRATED IN AN ADULTS-ONLY ROOM THAT ILLUMINATES SEXUAL PRACTICES OF AN ASTONISHING PHYSICAL INGENUITY). HE IS A WORLD BUILDER. THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT EXHIBITION CURATOR ALEXANDRE SAMSON RECOGNISED WHEN HE INSISTED THAT JORG KARL HUYSMANS HAD TO BE THE UNIFYING THREAD OF THE ENTIRE SHOW, GIVEN THAT THERE’S RARELY BEEN AN INTERVIEW WHERE OWENS DIDN’T NAMECHECK THE 19TH CENTURY AUTHOR OF “AGAINST NATURE.” IT’S THE HYPNOTISING UR-TEXT OF LITERARY DECADENCE. AND IT’S A PARTICULAR KIND OF PERSON WHO COMES TO HUYSMANS AT A DEFINING JUNCTURE IN THEIR LIVES. OWENS WAS CLEARLY ONE OF THEM. “HE WAS MY EXCUSE TO COMPLETELY INDULGE MYSELF IN AESTHETIC PLEASURES AND SENSES. HE MADE IT PLAUSIBLE FOR A SOPHISTICATED ADULT TO WITHDRAW FROM LIFE AND ONLY CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE MOST SOPHISTICATED AESTHETIC PLEASURE. SO WE ENDED UP USING THAT AS THE THEME FOR THE WHOLE RETROSPECTIVE.” NOW, TRANSLATE THAT TO THE COLLECTION OWENS PRESENTED ON THURSDAY. HIS MODELS EASED THEIR WAY DOWN THE RUNGS OF THE ZIGGURAT INTO THE REFLECTING POOL OF THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, FORGED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WATER IN THEIR WEIGHTY, WONDERFUL GARMENTS, SUBMERGING, RE-EMERGING LIKE MERMEN, OR REVENANTS. THE TRAILING FRINGES ON LEATHER JACKETS SUDDENLY LOOKED LIKE STRANDS OF SEAWEED. SODDEN SILK TAFFETAS AND INDUSTRIAL NYLONS CLUNG TO TORSOS LIKE SECOND SKINS, RUBBERISED SEQUINS SPARKLED LIKE DROPS OF WATER. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING ELEMENTAL IN RICK’S SHOWS, BUT THIS FELT SOMEHOW MORE PROFOUND. FROM THE WATER WE CAME, TO THE WATER WE WILL RETURN, IN A SINGLE SENSUAL MULTIMILLENNIAL CYCLE. REBIRTH. WELL, THAT WAS THE MOVIE IN MY MIND, AT LEAST. OWENS INSISTED THAT, AT CORE, HIS COLLECTION ADDRESSED HIS CONCERNS ABOUT AGEING. HE’S A WAY OFF 70, BUT IT’S ON HIS MIND. HIS SOUNDTRACK WAS KLAUS NOMI, NEW YORK’S NO WAVE ALT-OPERA STAR, SINGING “DIDO’S LAMENT” FROM HENRY PURCELL’S “DIDO AND AENEAS.” “DEATH INVADES ME, DEATH IS NOW A WELCOME GUEST.” WORDS WHOSE IMPACT IS ONLY HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT NOMI WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO DIE OF AIDS IN THE NEW YORK ART SCENE. IF THAT IS THE SHADOW THAT HAS HUNG HEAVY OVER OWENS’S WORK, IT’S ALSO FIRED UP THE EXTRAORDINARY NO-COMPROMISE FEARLESSNESS THAT MADE THE SHOW HE STAGED ON THURSDAY SO UPLIFTING. AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN HIS DUAL PRESENTATIONS WAS ESPECIALLY ILLUMINATING. IT WAS A GORGEOUS SHOCK TO SEE HIS MODELS DIVE FULLY CLAD INTO THE PALAIS DE TOKYO’S POOL. AND THE “SPECIAL ROOM” AT “TEMPLE OF LOVE” WAS A SALUTARY REMINDER OF RICK’S BONE-DEEP TRANSGRESSIVE APPETITES IN THE FULL-SCALE SIMULACRUM OF HIMSELF PISSING. IT ORIGINALLY DEBUTED AT PITTI UOMO IN FLORENCE IN 2006. HE SAID HE STILL FEELS CLOSE TO THAT PERSON. “EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE ONLINE JUDGEMENT IS SO MUCH MORE STRIDENT NOW THAN IT EVER USED TO BE. WHAT’S HAPPENING POLITICALLY IN THE WORLD, WE NEED RESISTANCE MORE THAN EVER.” RICK INSISTS HE’S STILL FINDING NEW WAYS TO PISS. THAT PROMISE IS MY FAVOURITE THREAT. THE SHOW RANG OUT WITH “DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD,” SCREECHING, ELECTRIC. A CHANGE IS A-COMIN’.

THE DESIGNER, BORN IN 1963 IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, HAS CARVED OUT HIS OWN PATH FOR OVER THREE DECADES, KNOWN FOR HIS IMPOSING PRESENCE AND COLLECTIONS THAT ARE BOTH PROVOCATIVE AND POETIC. BUT A MERE FOOTNOTE HE IS NOT. HIS FIERCELY INDEPENDENT LABEL IS NOW A €200 MILLION POWERHOUSE, WITH DEVOTED FOLLOWERS AND MUSEUMS COMPETING FOR HIS WORK. SPEAKING OF MUSEUMS: STARTING TOMORROW AND RUNNING THROUGH JANUARY 4, 2026, TEMPLE OF LOVE OPENS AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA—THE FIRST EXHIBITION IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL DEDICATED TO OWENS, WHO HAS LIVED IN PARIS SINCE 2003 WITH HIS WIFE, ARTIST MICHÈLE LAMY. WHY DID YOU NAME IT TEMPLE OF LOVE? “BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT I’D LIKE IT TO BE. I WAS A FLAMBOYANT KID IN A CONSERVATIVE TOWN—I NEVER FORGOT THE WAY PEOPLE LOOKED DOWN ON ME. BUT THEN I DISCOVERED DAVID BOWIE AND THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, I FELT SAFE. THERE WAS ROOM FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME, PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T FIT INTO THE DOMINANT CULTURE. SO I DECIDED TO BE THE OUTSIDER. THINK OF THE BEAUTY SECTIONS IN AIRPORT DUTY-FREE SHOPS.” WHAT ABOUT THEM? “THEY’RE ALL THE SAME. THEY SELL THE SAME PRODUCTS, PROMOTE THE SAME IDEAL: A PERFECT BODY, LOUNGING ON A YACHT IN CAPRI, HAVING PERFECT SEX WITH SOMEONE EQUALLY PERFECT. AND THAT’S FINE—BUT THERE’S MORE TO LIFE. I PUSH BACK AGAINST THAT KIND OF STANDARDIZATION.” AND QUITE SUCCESSFULLY. “STILL, EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE. THAT’S WHY I WANTED THIS RETROSPECTIVE. MY WIFE HATES THE WORD BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THE END OF SOMETHING. AND SHE’S RIGHT. THAT’S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT. IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT HOW WE ALL CONFRONT OUR OWN MORTALITY. I’M OVER SIXTY—I FEEL TIME SLIPPING BY. AND IT SCARES ME. IT REMINDS ME OF MY FATHER.” IN WHAT WAY? “HE GREW UP IN AN ORPHANAGE DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION. IT LEFT A MARK. HE WAS A TROUBLED MAN WHO NEVER ACCEPTED WHO I WAS. BUT HE WAS ALSO A SCHOLAR—HE INTRODUCED ME TO ART, LITERATURE, AND THEOLOGY. I USED TO THINK ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE WOULD BRING HIM PEACE, BUT HE ONLY GREW MORE BITTER. AND IF HE COULDN’T FIND PEACE, WHAT CHANCE DO I HAVE? I WORRY ABOUT BECOMING LIKE HIM, IN HIS BRILLIANCE, BUT ALSO IN HIS FLAWS. THAT’S PART OF WHY I FEEL THE NEED TO CONFRONT MY MORTALITY, HOWEVER I CAN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SOUNDTRACK TO MY SPRING/SUMMER 2026 MEN’S SHOW—JUST BEFORE THE EXHIBITION OPENS—IS DIDO’S DEATH ARIA FROM PURCELL’S DIDO AND AENEAS.” BACK IN 2017, YOU HAD SUBHUMAN INHUMAN SUPERHUMAN AT THE TRIENNALE IN MILAN. HOW IS THIS SHOW DIFFERENT? “IN MILAN, I HAD FULL CONTROL. IT WAS LIKE WRITING MY OWN OBITUARY. WHICH IS A LUXURY” (HE LAUGHS). “THEN AGAIN, ISN’T THAT WHAT INSTAGRAM IS FOR? WE ALL USE IT TO PRESENT THE BEST VERSION OF OURSELVES—THE ONE WE WANT TO BE REMEMBERED BY. BUT I’D SAY THE PARIS RETROSPECTIVE REVEALS A MORE VULNERABLE SIDE OF ME, ESPECIALLY FROM THE EARLY YEARS.” MANY DESIGNERS DISLIKE EXHIBITIONS; THEY THINK CLOTHES NEED TO BE SEEN IN MOTION. “BUT I LOVE STILLNESS. IT LETS YOU REALLY TAKE IN THE EXPERIENCE. WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE VIDEOS FOR THE GALLIERA SHOW, SOMEONE TOLD ME THEY HAD TO BE NO LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS—THAT’S THE ATTENTION SPAN FOR SOCIAL MEDIA. I REFUSED TO CATER TO THAT.” WHAT BOTHERS YOU ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA? “I THINK IT’S MANIPULATIVE. THOUGH MAYBE I FEEL THAT WAY BECAUSE, AT 63, I DON’T REALLY SEE MYSELF REFLECTED IN THE PRESENT ANYMORE. I LOOK AT YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THINK THAT AT SOME POINT, THEY WILL TURN AGAINST ME. IT’S PART OF THE CYCLE—EVERY NEW GENERATION HAS TO REJECT THE LAST TO FIND ITS OWN IDENTITY.” I THINK THEY ADMIRE YOU TOO MUCH TO DO THAT. “BUT THEY SHOULD PUSH BACK! I DID. I WAS NAÏVE; I WORE SHREDDED CLOTHES TO SYMBOLIZE THE COLLAPSE OF THE FASHION SYSTEM. NOW, IN DEFIANCE OF TODAY’S NORMS, I WEAR MORE CLASSIC PIECES. MORE REFINED. THE WORLD COULD USE A LITTLE REFINEMENT THESE DAYS.” IS IT TRUE YOU HAD TROUBLE GETTING THE CITY TO APPROVE THE EXHIBITION POSTER FOR PUBLIC DISPLAY? “THEY WERE UNSURE AT FIRST. I EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS A TRIBUTE TO ALFONS MUCHA’S BELLE ÉPOQUE POSTERS—A WAY FOR ME TO CONNECT WITH THE CITY. THEY UNDERSTOOD. I’M REALLY HAPPY ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT’S ALSO A TRIBUTE TO MY WIFE.

A CONVERSATION WITH A SIXTY-SOMETHING “MORE FIRED UP THAN EVER.” FASHION EXHIBITIONS DEDICATED TO LIVING DESIGNERS ARE RARE. FEW HAVE BUILT A BODY OF WORK STRONG ENOUGH TO CONVINCE CURATORS THEY BELONG IN A MUSEUM WITHOUT THE PASSAGE OF TIME. BUT RICK OWENS IS AN EXCEPTION. HONORED NOW AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA—THE CITY OF PARIS’S FASHION MUSEUM—THE 63-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN DESIGNER HAS TAKEN AN UNCONVENTIONAL PATH. AFTER A CHALLENGING START IN 1990S LOS ANGELES, HE FOUND HIS FOOTING IN PARIS, WHERE HE SETTLED IN 2003. HIS NAMESAKE LABEL HAS REMAINED PROUDLY INDEPENDENT. BEFORE STRIKING OUT ON HIS OWN, OWENS STUDIED INDUSTRIAL PATTERN-MAKING AND WORKED AS A TECHNICIAN FOR COUNTERFEIT LUXURY MANUFACTURERS—EXPERIENCE THAT GAVE HIM TAILORING SKILLS NOT COMMONLY FOUND AMONG CONTEMPORARY DESIGNERS. HIS INTRICATELY STRUCTURED GARMENTS DRAW ON THE GLAMOUR OF THE 1930S, FILTERED THROUGH UNDERGROUND SUBCULTURES AND THE PEOPLE HE’S SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH. THROUGH OFTEN-PROVOCATIVE RUNWAY SHOWS, OWENS CELEBRATES THE BATTERED BEAUTY OF DRIFTERS, JUNKIES, AND TRANSGENDER SEX WORKERS. THIS SINGULAR VISION, ONE HE HAS NEVER STRAYED FROM IN OVER 30 YEARS, IS WHAT CONVINCED ALEXANDRE SAMSON, HEAD OF CONTEMPORARY FASHION AT GALLIERA AND CURATOR OF RICK OWENS: TEMPLE OF LOVE, TO OPEN THE MUSEUM’S DOORS TO HIM AND ENTRUST HIM WITH FULL ARTISTIC DIRECTION OF THE EXHIBITION. WE MET WITH THE DESIGNER ON-SITE. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SEE YOUR WORK ENTER A MUSEUM? AND I’M NOT EVEN DEAD! ISN’T THAT FANTASTIC? THE PALAIS GALLIERA IS WHERE I SAW SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FASHION EXHIBITIONS—ON MARIANO FORTUNY, THE COUNTESS GREFFULHE... BEING DISPLAYED HERE FEELS LIKE THE PEAK OF MY CAREER. MY WIFE, MICHÈLE [LAMY], KEEPS TELLING ME I SHOULD STOP CALLING IT A “RETROSPECTIVE” BECAUSE THAT SUGGESTS AN INEVITABLE DECLINE. AND SHE’S RIGHT—BUT I FIND A KIND OF MORBID COMFORT IN THAT. SOME DESIGNERS CREATE A SUGAR-COATED WORLD. THAT’S NOT MY STYLE. I LOVE BEAUTY WHEN IT HAS A PATINA THAT TELLS THE STORY OF LIFE’S STRUGGLES. WHAT DID YOU WANT TO EXPRESS WITH THIS EXHIBITION? I ALREADY HAD A RETROSPECTIVE IN MILAN IN 2018, WHICH I FULLY DIRECTED—IT WAS SPECTACULAR. I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I EVER DID IT AGAIN, I’D WANT IT TO BE SOFTER, TO REFLECT ON BEGINNINGS, VULNERABILITY, TECHNIQUE, AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME. THAT WORKED OUT WELL BECAUSE THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT ALEXANDRE [SAMSON] ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. DO YOU FEEL YOUR WORK IS SOMETIMES REDUCED TO ITS EXCESSES? THAT’S DEFINITELY WHAT I’M KNOWN FOR, BUT I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO SEE OTHER SIDES OF MY WORK. THE LARGE SPACE AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, WHERE I’VE EXHIBITED FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS, ENCOURAGES ME TO GO BIG. I ENJOY TAKING SIMPLE ELEMENTS—FLOWER PETALS, SMOKE, WATER—AND AMPLIFYING THEM. I PREFER LIGHTING FIREWORKS AND BLASTING MUSIC OVER CREATING A SET THAT NEEDS TO BE DECONSTRUCTED. THE SHOW DEMONSTRATES HOW YOUR SILHOUETTES HAVE BECOME MORE VOLUMINOUS OVER TIME… YES, AND EVEN MORE UNAPOLOGETIC. BUT IN STORES, YOU’LL FIND EVERYTHING: THEATRICAL RUNWAY PIECES, AS WELL AS CASHMERE SWEATERS AND BASIC TEES—SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE, FROM GRANDMOTHERS TO SKATEBOARDERS. IT REFLECTS HOW I DRESS, TOO. [ON THIS DAY, OWENS WEARS DISCREET BLACK SHORTS AND A T-SHIRT, PAIRED WITH STRIKING LEATHER BOOTS WITH PLEXIGLAS HEELS.] IT’S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SHOW THAT I BELIEVE IN WHAT I CREATE. THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOME EFFEMINATE KID OUT THERE WHO FEELS LOST WILL SEE ME AND THINK, “SO IT’S POSSIBLE TO EMBRACE THE WEIRDO INSIDE ME.” WHY DID YOU DESIGN THE FIRST EXHIBITION ROOM AT GALLIERA TO RESEMBLE A CHAPEL? I WAS INSPIRED BY AN EDWARD STEICHEN PHOTO FROM A 1937 OPERA (THE ETERNAL ROAD, BY FRANZ WERFEL, STAGED IN NEW YORK). I’VE ALWAYS LOVED ART DECO AND THE IMAGERY OF THE 1920S AND ’30S—THAT’S WHAT FILLED THE SHELVES IN MY FAMILY’S LIBRARY. THAT, ALONG WITH BOOKS ABOUT SILENT FILMS MY FATHER HAD SEEN WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. HE WAS A TOUGH MAN—RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC—BUT HE LOVED ART. I GREW UP IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, A DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE, GLOOMY SMALL TOWN. THOSE BOOKS SHAPED MY TASTE. WHY DID YOU ARRANGE THE SILHOUETTES IN A SEMICIRCLE IN THE SECOND ROOM? WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT LARGE GALLERY AND ALEXANDRE TOLD ME WE COULD OPEN THE CURTAINS, I SAW THE OPPORTUNITY TO ARRANGE ALL THE LOOKS IN A WIDE ARC, FACING THE SUNLIGHT. TYPICALLY, DARKNESS IS NEEDED TO PROTECT GARMENTS, BUT SINCE THESE LOOKS COME FROM MY PERSONAL ARCHIVE, I CAN AFFORD TO LET THEM FADE. MAYBE THE PATINA WILL MAKE THEM EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL. WHAT’S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR ARCHIVES? WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT, I NEVER IMAGINED ARCHIVING ANYTHING—I WAS JUST FOCUSED ON SURVIVAL. IF I COULD SELL SOMETHING, I DID. THAT’S HOW I PAID THE RENT. I’M NOT LIKE TODAY’S FASHION STUDENTS, WHO START ARCHIVING THEIR WORK BEFORE THEY EVEN GET INTO THE INDUSTRY! ONLY RECENTLY HAVE I BEGUN SAVING PIECES, NOW THAT I HAVE THE MEANS. BUT HONESTLY, I’M TOO MUCH OF A CYNIC TO WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE. IF I’M NOT AROUND ANYMORE, WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF MY CLOTHES? DO YOU SEE YOURSELF STOPPING ANYTIME SOON? NOT AT ALL—I’M MORE FIRED UP THAN EVER! ONE OF MY MAIN MOTIVATIONS IS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST MORAL JUDGMENT—AGAINST PEOPLE WHO TRY TO POLICE HOW OTHERS LIVE. AND RIGHT NOW, THAT CONSERVATIVE WAVE IS STRONGER THAN EVER... THAT’S WHAT MY STATUE OF MYSELF URINATING IS ABOUT [DISPLAYED IN THE SECTION DEVOTED TO PROVOCATION]—A PRIMITIVE, CHILDISH GESTURE THAT SAYS I DON’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT DECORUM. IT’S SOMETHING ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND.

IN THE COURTYARD OF THE PALAIS GALLIERA, THE PARIS FASHION MUSEUM, IN EARLY JUNE, RICK OWENS POSES FOR LIBÉRATION. HE’S AGAINST A WALL, ON THE STEPS, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS—FULL-FRONTAL, IN PROFILE, THREE-QUARTERS VIEW. IT&#39;S AN EXTREMELY RARE OPPORTUNITY FROM A DESIGNER OF HIS CALIBER. IN FACT, A YOUNG WOMAN CALLS OUT TO US, SAYING, &quot;AM I DREAMING OR IS THAT REALLY RICK OWENS?!&quot; WE CONFIRM AND TELL HER ABOUT AN UPCOMING RETROSPECTIVE. SHE RESPONDS, &quot;WELL, ME, A LITTLE PROVINCIAL, I SAW RICK OWENS, RICK OWENS!&quot; BUT WHO ISN&#39;T A LITTLE PROVINCIAL WHEN FACED WITH THE AMERICAN DESIGNER AS IF FROM ANOTHER PLANET? ACTIVE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY FASHION CONGLOMERATE, &quot;RICK&quot; BELONGS TO THE EXCLUSIVE GROUP OF DESIGNERS KNOWN FOR MORE THAN JUST CLOTHING. WITH A STRONG IDENTITY, COMMITTED TO RADICALISM, THE MARGINS, AND THE SPECTACULAR. AT FASHION WEEK, HIS SHOWS ARE UNMISSABLE, DRAMATIC PROCESSIONS OF HYBRID CREATURES (ZOMBIES? DRAGS? VESTALS? ANDROIDS?), AS IF EMERGING FROM A VORTEX THAT BLENDS MYTHOLOGY, SCIENCE FICTION, PEPLUM, GLAM, ROCK, PUNK, SPIRITUALITY, SM, AND KABUKI... A STUNNING, BIZARRE, REBELLIOUS BEAUTY, PERCHED ON HUGE BOOTS, GENDERLESS, EVEN UNSETTLING, WITH PALE FACES, SHAVED HEADS, MASSIVE HAIR OR HOODS, AND MYSTERIOUS, PROFOUND GAZES, PUPILS OBSCURED BY LENSES. HIS COLLECTIONS ALSO CHALLENGE CONVENTIONS. SCULPTURAL GARMENTS WITH STRIKING VOLUMES, CUTS, AND DRAPES, EXAGGERATED BOTH IN MAXI AND MINI SIZES, WHICH CAN ENVELOP THE BODY COMPLETELY OR REVEAL IT DOWN TO THE PENIS. THE GRANDEUR, SOPHISTICATION, AND PRECISION OF HAUTE COUTURE APPLIED TO UNDERGROUND FASHION, ALL SET TO A BASSLINE THAT COULD WAKE THE DEAD. A BOLD STATEMENT. RICK OWENS&#39; VOICE IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. SILKY, ENVELOPING, ALMOST THERAPEUTIC, COMBINED WITH THE SOPHISTICATION OF AN AMBASSADOR. WE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH IT, BUT THE CONTRAST STILL SURPRISES US. HE&#39;S USED TO IT. WHEN ASKED, &quot;WHAT MISTAKE DO PEOPLE MAKE MOST OFTEN ABOUT YOU?&quot; RICK OWENS RESPONDS, &quot;ASSUMING I&#39;M GEARED TOWARD PROVOCATION AND AGGRESSION WHEN IN REALITY, IT&#39;S TOWARD CONTRIBUTION. &#39;DARK,&#39; &#39;SOMBER&#39; ... IT&#39;S REDUCTIVE. YOU KNOW, I COULD PROPOSE AN AESTHETIC THAT WOULD BE NOTHING BUT CANDY. BUT THEN I WOULDN&#39;T FEEL LIKE IT&#39;S THE WHOLE TRUTH. MY OBJECTIVE IS POETRY, AND POETRY SPEAKS OF THE DIFFICULTIES AND QUESTIONS WE ALL FACE.&quot; AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA, HE REPEATS LIKE AN INCANTATION, &quot;THE OBJECTIVE IS POETRY, POETRY.&quot; HE HIMSELF IS, IN OUR EYES, UTTERLY POETIC. A MEDAL-SHAPED PROFILE WITH AN AQUILINE NOSE AND PROMINENT CHEEKBONES, LONG CHARCOAL HAIR, A LEAN, MUSCULAR BODY SHAPED BY THE AUDIENCE, AND AN OVERALL APPEARANCE REMINISCENT OF AN APACHE OR AZTEC CHIEF (HIS MOTHER WAS MEXICAN), BUT DRESSED IN A CAP, VEST, AND LOOSE BLACK SHORTS PAIRED WITH A FROCK COAT AND SNEAKERS WITH XXL SOLES, IN WHICH HE WALKS STRAIGHT, FLUIDLY, SMILING. ALEXANDRE SAMSON, THE CURATOR OF THE STUNNING EXHIBITION, DESCRIBES HIM AS AN INTERLOCUTOR OPEN TO DISCUSSION, SERENE, ENGAGED, AND NOT COMPLICATED — &quot;WHICH IS FAR FROM ALWAYS BEING THE CASE.&quot; WE ENVISION A MEDITATOR, A MASTER OF THE PRESENT MOMENT, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS CHASING TRENDS. OWENS SMILES. &quot;OH NO, I TEND TO TAKE A NAP EVERY DAY. I THINK I&#39;VE LEARNED TO PROTECT MY ENERGY, WHICH ISN&#39;T INFINITE. IT&#39;S AT 11 A.M. AND 5 P.M. THAT I FEEL THE FRESHEST AND MOST EFFICIENT.&quot; THAT SHOWS HE KNOWS HIMSELF VERY WELL. &quot;I TRY. WE&#39;RE ALL TRYING, AREN&#39;T WE?&quot; RICK OWENS DOESN&#39;T APPEAR HIS 63 YEARS, BUT HE HAS THE GENTLE AURA OF A WISE OLD UNIFIER. HIS SHOW NOTES OFTEN REFERENCE CURRENT SOCIAL OR GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES, ACCOMPANIED BY CALMING MESSAGES. THE BED OF AZURE MORNING GLORIES HE INSISTED ON PLANTING IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALAIS GALLIERA, ECHOING THOSE OF HIS CHILDHOOD, ALSO REVEALS HIS SENTIMENTAL SIDE. IT&#39;S ALSO TRUE THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS FORGOTTEN. RICK OWENS, ESTABLISHED AND RENOWNED, CONSISTENTLY APPEARS AT AIRPORTS IN PLATFORM BOOTS WITH PLEXIGLAS HEELS AND A COMPLETE LOOK TO MATCH. HIS DELIBERATE, STRIKING EFFECT: &quot;FIRSTLY, BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO I AM AND THAT I BELIEVE IN WHAT I DO, I DON&#39;T OFFER ANYTHING THAT I DON&#39;T WEAR MYSELF. SECONDLY, I WANT TO SHOW LITTLE 11-YEAR-OLD GAYS WHO ARE AFRAID THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE WHOEVER YOU WANT, THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.&quot; HE WAS INITIALLY PREVENTED FROM DOING SO, AS A &quot;VERY SHY, VERY EFFEMINATE, VERY FEARFUL, AND VERY ISOLATED&quot; CHILD IN PORTERVILLE, A PURITANICAL TOWN IN CALIFORNIA. HIS DEVOUT MOTHER, A SCHOOLTEACHER, AND HIS SOCIAL WORKER FATHER DIDN&#39;T UNDERSTAND, BUT THEY WERE LOVING. HIS FATHER, AN EX-GI AND AN AESTHETE, RAISED HIM ON EUROPEAN LITERATURE AND CLASSICAL MUSIC. HE HAD AN EPIPHANY: AGAINST THE GRAIN, JORIS-KARL HUYSMANS&#39; ODE TO DECADENCE. THE INSULTS AND BLOWS FROM BOYS HIS AGE CEASED IN ADOLESCENCE, WHEN THE BULLIED BOY RELEASED HIS PENT-UP RAGE. THIS MARKED THE START OF A FACE-OFF AGAINST THE ORTHODOX NORMS OF THE &quot;STRAIGHT&quot; WORLD, NORMS HE WOULD CHALLENGE THROUGH CLOTHING AFTER CONSIDERING HIMSELF A PAINTER AND EXPLORING VARIOUS SUBSTANCES AND SEXUALITIES. THE TURNING POINT CAME FROM DIVINE INTERVENTION IN 1987: MICHÈLE LAMY. THIS JURA NATIVE, WITH THE AIR OF THE QUEEN OF SHEBA, WITH KOHL-LINED EYES, A CRYPTIC SMILE, AND HENNA TATTOOS, KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT ICONOCLASM. AS A CHILD, THE DAUGHTER OF A GOOD FAMILY FRIGHTENED THE NUNS IN CHARGE OF HER EDUCATION. LATER, IN PARIS, THE WIFE OF A BUSINESS LAWYER, SHE BECAME ONE OF DELEUZE&#39;S DISCIPLES AND BEFRIENDED HÉLÈNE HAZÉRA AND MARIE-FRANCE, PIONEERS OF THE HOMOSEXUAL AND TRANS MOVEMENT, BEFORE HEADING TO LOS ANGELES TO MAKE A SPLASH: OPENING A FASHION BOUTIQUE, LAUNCHING A BRAND, AND LATER TWO RESTAURANT-CLUBS. RICK OWENS JOINED THIS BURST OF CREATIVITY AS A TALENTED PATTERNMAKER. HE STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND HER (THAT SHARP FRENCH ACCENT), BUT THE VERSATILE JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES, MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS HIS SENIOR AND MOTHER OF A YOUNG DAUGHTER, FASCINATED HIM. FROM FRIEND, LAMY TRANSFORMED INTO LOVE, WITH A GUIDING INFLUENCE FOR OWENS: QUITTING DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. THEIR MARRIAGE AND THE CREATION OF THE RICK OWENS LABEL SEALED THEIR ALLIANCE OF OUTSIDERS. TEN YEARS LATER, THEY SETTLED IN PARIS, WHERE FASHION WAS RECOGNIZED. THEIR HOUSE, WHICH EVOLVED INTO BRUTALIST DESIGN UNDER MICHÈLE&#39;S LEADERSHIP, HAS OCCUPIED A BUILDING ON PLACE DU PALAIS-BOURBON SINCE 2006 — A FORTRESS-LIKE COCOON JUST A STONE&#39;S THROW FROM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. OWENS ALSO SPENDS PART OF HIS TIME IN ITALY, MAINTAINING DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE FACTORIES THAT PRODUCE HIS EXCESS. MICHÈLE LAMY, A BOXER IN CONSTANT MOTION, DISLIKES THE TERM &quot;RETROSPECTIVE&quot; AND ITS CONNOTATIONS OF A CURTAIN CALL. RICK OWENS SMILES AT IT AND ACCEPTS IT FOR WHAT IT IS. &quot;I MIGHT AS WELL PLAY WITH ALL THAT, I LIKE THE THEATRICALITY!&quot; DOES IT ALSO MAKE US LOOK IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR? &quot;YES, AND IT FILLS ME WITH GRATITUDE. EVERYONE WANTS TO BE HEARD, AND AS A DESIGNER I HAVE BEEN, I AM IMMENSELY. GRATITUDE IS HAPPINESS.&quot; THESE DAYS, HE&#39;S LEARNING FRENCH, &quot;TO BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH THIS COUNTRY.&quot; FROM ANOTHER WORLD, BUT WITH AN OUTSTRETCHED HAND.

DON&#39;T GET IN THE WAY. — JULY 28, 2025 — BY VANESSA FRIEDMAN RECENTLY RICK OWENS, A SELF-PROCLAIMED “SISSY KID” FROM PORTERVILLE, CALIF., TURNED UNDERGROUND LOS ANGELES DESIGNER TURNED PARISIAN FASHION DARK LORD, OPENED AN ONLYFANS ACCOUNT — FOR HIS FEET. THE NOMINAL MOTIVATION FOR THE ACCOUNT WAS A SHOW. NOT THE EPIC MEN’S SHOW/QUASI-RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE HE HELD THURSDAY, BUT A CAREER RETROSPECTIVE AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA. ENTITLED “TEMPLE OF LOVE,” IT PLACES HIS FUTURISTIC, FREAK-MEETS-GODDESS AESTHETIC CONVINCINGLY IN THE PANTHEON OF SUCH FASHION GREATS AS AZZEDINE ALAÏA AND MARIO FORTUNY AND CONFIRMS HIS PLACE AS THE MOST INSIDE OUTSIDER IN FASHION. BUT HAVING REACHED THAT PINNACLE GOT HIM THINKING ABOUT DECLINE, WHICH GOT HIM THINKING ABOUT THE COUNTESS OF CASTIGLIONE, ONE OF NAPOLEON’S MISTRESSES AND A CELEBRATED BEAUTY WHO EVENTUALLY RETREATED TO AN APARTMENT ON PLACE VENDÔME AND, MR. OWENS SAID, “ONLY EVER DID PORTRAITS OF HER FEET.” SO HE DECIDED TO DO IT HIS WAY, WITH ALL THE PROFITS GOING TO A REFUGE FOR TRANS YOUTH. SEX AND DEATH ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE OWENS SHTICK. SO ARE WIDE-RANGING CLASSICAL ALLUSIONS, BEAUTY AND GENEROSITY, ALL OF IT WRAPPED UP IN A COMPLICATED BATTLE OF GRANDIOSE SILHOUETTES AND FAR-FLUNG REFERENCES THAT GETS RESOLVED IN SOME OF THE MOST GORGEOUS, ORIGINAL CLOTHES BEING MADE TODAY. THAT IS WHY THE SWEEPING DISPLAY OF THE MUSEUM SHOW IS BOOKENDED BY TWO SMALL ROOMS. ONE FEATURES A RUMPLED BED THAT IS A REPLICA OF THE BED IN MR. OWENS’S HOME IN HIS EARLY YEARS IN L.A. THE OTHER, WHICH COMES WITH A WARNING LABEL, FEATURES A NUMBER OF VIDEOS, INCLUDING ONE OF MICHÈLE LAMY, MR. OWENS’S WIFE, MUSE, BUSINESS PARTNER AND ALL-AROUND ENABLER ON HER 80TH BIRTHDAY, PULLING DOWN HER UNDERPANTS AND SITTING SQUASH ON TOP OF HER CHOCOLATE BIRTHDAY CAKE. IN FRONT OF THE VIDEOS, ON A PLINTH, IS A LIFE-SIZE, ANATOMICALLY CORRECT SCULPTURE OF A SHIRTLESS MR. OWENS IN LEATHER JEANS, PEEING INTO A BASIN. HE HAD IT MADE BY THE EXPERTS AT MADAME TUSSAUD’S FOR A PITTI UOMO MEN’S WEAR SHOW IN 2006. THERE IS NO OTHER DESIGNER WORKING TODAY — CERTAINLY NOT ONE WITH ABOUT $140 MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES — WHOSE LIFE AND SELF ARE AS FULLY INTERTWINED WITH HIS BRAND AS RICK OWENS. HE SLEEPS AND EATS WHERE HE WORKS AND WORKS WHERE HE WORKS OUT AND WEARS WHAT HE MAKES. NONE OF IT IS A PERFORMANCE. ALL OF IT IS REAL. FROM THE OUTSIDE IT CAN LOOK BIZARRE, BUT IT IS ALWAYS ENTIRELY SINCERE. ALMOST ROUTINE. SIMPLY CONSIDER A DAY IN HIS LIFE. OR HOW HIS LIFE IS REFLECTED IN HIS DAY. 8 A.M. MR. OWENS ALWAYS GETS UP AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND EVEN ON VACATION. HE AND MS. LAMY SLEEP ON THE FOURTH FLOOR OF HIS HEADQUARTERS, WHICH WERE ONCE THE SOCIALIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS IN THE HEART OF BOURGEOIS PARIS. THE ROOM IS DOMINATED BY A MONUMENTAL BED OF HIS OWN DESIGN AND A GIANT FLAT-SCREEN TV. THE FIRST THINGS HE DOES AFTER HIS ALARM GOES OFF IS READ THE NEWSPAPERS, ANSWER EMAILS AND THEN, AT LEAST FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WATCH “THE BLACK CAT,” A 1934 MOVIE STARRING BELA LUGOSI AND BORIS KARLOFF. THE FILM IS ABOUT “A YOUNG COUPLE WHOSE CAR CRASHES AND THEY END UP IN THIS BIG MANSION OWNED BY AN ARCHITECT WHO, IT TURNS OUT, HAPPENS TO HAVE A SATANIC CULT AND KEEPS HIS EX-LOVERS IN GLASS CASES IN HIS BASEMENT,” MR. OWENS SAID. “IT’S BLACK-AND-WHITE ART DECO, KIND OF CREEPY, WONDERFULLY SATANIC AND ALSO RIDICULOUS,” HE SAID, WHICH COULD ALSO BE A DESCRIPTION OF HIS OWN WORK. “BUT THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE VILLAIN HAS FOUND A WAY TO TRAP HIS PASSIONS, TO ISOLATE THEM AND KEEP THEM IN A VERY CONTROLLED WAY, THAT IS SOOTHING TO ME. SO I INDULGE IN THAT.” MR. OWENS DOESN’T HAVE A PARTICULARLY ELABORATE MORNING BEAUTY ROUTINE. THE EXCEPTION IS HIS HAIR, WHICH HE DYES BLACK HIMSELF EVERY TWO WEEKS. HE DOESN’T CUT IT, BUT HE DOES GET IT CHEMICALLY STRAIGHTENED EVERY THREE MONTHS. “IT’S GETTING THINNER,” HE SAID. “EVERY TIME I GO TO THE HAIR SALON, I’M NERVOUS THEY’RE GOING TO SAY: ‘WE JUST CAN’T DO THIS ANY MORE. YOUR HAIR’S SO THIN, AND THERE’S A BALD SPOT.’” HE SAID THAT IF THEY DID, “I’D FIND SOMEBODY LESS SCRUPULOUS.” HE LIKES IT BECAUSE “IT JUST TIDIES EVERYTHING.” “I DON’T LIKE CLUTTER,” HE SAID. “MAYBE THERE’S SOMETHING UNDISCIPLINED I’M AFRAID OF. OBVIOUSLY, I LIVE WITH MICHÈLE, AND SHE IS COMPLETELY CHAOTIC. BUT THERE’S SOMETHING SO GRACEFUL ABOUT THE WAY SHE DOES IT THAT I ADMIRE. SHE’S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN MAKE ME RAISE MY VOICE. SHE LOVES CONFRONTATION. I LOVE DIFFUSING CONFRONTATION, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, SHE POKES THE BEAR, AND I JUST KIND OF LOSE IT. THEN I HATE MYSELF FOR MONTHS AFTERWARD FOR BEING SO WEAK.” 10 A.M. AFTER HIS COFFEE — ALWAYS TWO AND A HALF CUPS OF ESPRESSO — MR. OWENS HEADS DOWNSTAIRS TO HIS OFFICE-STUDIO. HE HATES BREAKFAST. “I NEED THE ESPRESSO AND THAT EMPTINESS TO FEEL MOMENTUM,” HE SAID. THE OFFICE IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HEADQUARTERS. ON THE FIRST FLOOR IS THE DINING ROOM, WHICH CONTAINS A GEORGES HOENTSCHEL URN THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE 1900 PARIS EXPOSITION. (IT WAS PART OF A PAIR; THE OTHER ONE IS IN THE MET.) NEARBY IS THE GRAND SALON, WHICH IS FILLED WITH RICK OWENS FURNITURE AND ART THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE COLLECTED. THEY HAVE AN ANSELM KIEFER THAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM BY THE ARTIST, AN ALUMINUM TANK FILLED WITH SPERM BY THE ESTONIAN RAPPER TOMMY CASH AND TWO STEEL BENCHES DESIGNED BY MR. OWENS, ATOP WHICH ARE STACKS OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE INSULATION BUT IS ACTUALLY FELTED HUMAN HAIR BY THE SERBIAN ARTIST ZORAN TODOROVIC; PEOPLE CAN SIT ON THE ART. ROUTINE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MR. OWENS. “WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I WAS A RAGING ALCOHOLIC,” HE SAID BY WAY OF EXPLANATION. “IT WAS MELODRAMATIC, A LITTLE BIT NIHILISTIC, A LITTLE BIT SELF-DESTRUCTIVE, VERY FEAR-BASED, ABOUT NEVER FULFILLING MY POTENTIAL, NEVER MAKING IT,” HE WENT ON. “SO WHEN I STOPPED DRINKING, I GOT VERY INTO ROUTINE. MAYBE THAT BECAME MY NEXT ADDICTION.” IT WASN’T DRUGS. MR. OWENS SAID HE AND MICHELE “DID LSD AND MUSHROOMS DURING COVID IN OUR GARDEN, BUT AFTER 20 MINUTES I WAS READY TO MOVE ON. I JUST DON’T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO COMMIT. AND I DON’T WANT TO KNOW THE DARK SIDES OF ME.” 11 A.M. AFTER 20 YEARS OF LIVING IN PARIS, MR. OWENS HAS STARTED TAKING FRENCH CLASSES. HE LIKED THE IDEA OF LEARNING SOMETHING NEW, AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE “POLITE” TO READ PART OF THE EXHIBITION’S AUDIO GUIDE IN FRENCH — INCLUDING A PASSAGE FROM OSCAR WILDE’S “SALOME.” BUT “IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN I THOUGHT,” HE SAID “I WONDER IF SOME BUTTONS WERE BEING PUSHED, REMINDING ME OF SCHOOL, AND THE PRESSURE AND THE STRESS OF FEELING STUPID AND AWKWARD.” NEVERTHELESS HE HAS KEPT UP WITH THE LESSONS BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD. 12 P.M. THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE ON THE OWENS DESIGN TEAM; MR. OWENS CUTS AND DRAPES MOST OF HIS CLOTHES HIMSELF. “I USED TO BE INTO DESTROYED EVERYTHING,” HE SAID. “I REALIZED THAT THE DESTROYED THING, WHICH IS A VERY COMMON CLASSICAL TROPE, WAS AN ADOLESCENT EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPT, WHICH MAKES ME WINCE A LITTLE BIT. I STILL HAVE THAT DEFIANCE AND REBELLION, BUT NOW, INSTEAD OF JUST COMPLAINING AND EXPRESSING CONTEMPT, I FEEL THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE A PROPOSAL AND TO CONTRIBUTE INSTEAD OF JUST COMPLAIN. I’M AIMING FOR SOMETHING MORE ELEGANT THAN JUST REJECTION. “IT’S A TRICKY THING. YOU WANT TO BE RECKLESS AND BOLD AND GO AS FAR AS YOU WANT TO GO, BUT YOU CAN’T GO TOO FAR OR YOU ALIENATE EVERYBODY.” 1:30 P.M. MR. OWENS GENERALLY EATS ON THE TERRACE OF HIS HOUSE WITH MS. LAMY. ONCE A WEEK HE MAY GO TO CAFÉ MARLY IN THE LOUVRE WITH THE PARIS STORE TEAM. HE EATS THE SAME THING ALMOST EVERY DAY: SALMON OR WHITEFISH WITH A SALAD OF BEETS, AVOCADO AND EGG WHITES AND PINEAPPLE AND MELON FOR DESSERT. RECENTLY HE CHANGED HIS DIET AFTER CONSULTING WITH A NUTRITIONIST. “THERE’S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PRESSURE EVERY DAY THAT I ACCEPT, AND I ENJOY,” HE SAID. “BUT I WAS WAKING UP FEELING A LITTLE MORE ANXIOUS.” HE ATTRIBUTED IT PARTLY TO THE DEATH OF HIS PARENTS. “I SUSPECT IT WAS MY FATHER,” HE SAID. “HIS BODY WAS SHUTTING DOWN, AND HE COULD NOT ACCEPT THAT. I LOOK AT MY DAD A LOT BECAUSE HE IS ME — ALL OF THE BAD THINGS IN ME, ALL OF THE GOOD THINGS. HE WAS AN ORPHAN DURING THE DEPRESSION, AND HIS LIFE WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT REFINING HIMSELF TO BE THE BEST HE COULD BE. HE WAS VERY HONORABLE. “UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS ALSO KIND OF MEAN. BUT HE’S MY BLUEPRINT. SO I’M THINKING, ‘IS THIS ANXIETY COMING FROM A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE?’ I WENT TO GET BLOOD TESTS. THE NUTRITIONIST SAID, ‘YOU’RE EATING TOO MUCH CAKE.’” 2:30 P.M. WHEN HE AND MS. LAMY MOVED TO PARIS, IN 2003, MR. OWENS STARTED TAKING A NAP EVERY DAY ON THE DAYBED IN HIS DRESSING ROOM. HE CALLS IT HIS ESCAPE ROUTE. “I HAD TO RESPOND TO SO MANY PEOPLE, THIS WAS MY WAY OF SHUTTING EVERYTHING OFF,” HE SAID. HIS DRESSING ROOM AND BATHROOM — AN ALL-MARBLE BOX THAT CONTAINS ONLY A MARBLE TOILET — ARE NEXT TO THE BEDROOM. MS. LAMY’S IS ON THE TOP FLOOR, AND HER DRESSING ROOM, WHICH IS LINED IN CARDBOARD PACKING BOXES WHERE SHE KEEPS HER CLOTHES, DOUBLES AS A GUEST BEDROOM. IT IS ALSO WHERE THEIR CAT, PIXIE, A HAIRLESS SPHYNX THAT RESEMBLES A GREMLIN, SLEEPS. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEY CLEAR OUT THEIR CLOSETS AND SEND A RACK OF CLOTHES TO THEIR FACTORY IN ITALY WITH A NOTE: “THIS IS FOR THE CHURCH.” IT MEANS ANYBODY CAN TAKE WHATEVER THEY WANT. 3 P.M. BACK TO WORK, PERHAPS CHECKING OUT THE LAST DETAILS FOR THE MUSEUM SHOW. IF MR. OWENS GOES TO THE GALLIERA, HE LIKES TO STOP AT A GROTTO BEHIND THE GRAND PALAIS, WHERE DRAGONFLIES FLIT AMONG THE BAMBOO. WHEN HE SEES THEM, HE POINTS AND GOES, “AW.” “PEOPLE WHO AREN’T INTO FASHION, OR WHO DON’T KNOW ME, CAN ASSUME THAT I’M THIS DYSTOPIAN, AGGRESSIVE PROVOCATEUR,” MR. OWENS SAID. “SO WHEN WE WERE COMING UP WITH A TITLE FOR THE SHOW, I THOUGHT WE NEEDED TO BALANCE THAT WITH SOMETHING WARM AND WELCOMING. JUST PUTTING THE WORD ‘LOVE’ OUT THERE IS NEVER A BAD IDEA.” LATER HE SAID, “IT’S BETTER THAN ‘I HATE CONSERVATIVES.’” 6:30 P.M. INSTEAD OF PRINCESS CAKE FROM THE SWEDISH INSTITUTE IN PARIS, WHICH USED TO BE HIS FAVORITE PICK-ME-UP, MR. OWENS NOW HAS A PROTEIN SHAKE MADE WITH ABBOT KINNEY’S COCONUT YOGURT, ONE SCOOP OF PROTEIN POWDER, TWO KIWIS AND BLUEBERRIES FOR A SNACK. THEN HE KEEPS WORKING. 8:30 P.M. LATELY MR. OWENS HAS BEEN HITTING THE HOME GYM HE SET UP IN HIS STUDIO. HE THOUGHT, “IT’S GREAT TO WORK OUT, TINKER ON SOMETHING, WORK OUT, TINKER.” CURRENTLY HE IS WORKING OUT TO A NEW REMIX OF “BURNING DOWN THE SLUTHOUSE” BY LOVEFOXY AND A TECHNO REMIX OF JEFFERSON AIRPLANE’S “SOMEBODY TO LOVE.” WHEN HE STARTED EXERCISING, HE TOOK GUIDED STEROIDS FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS, WHICH HE CREDITS WITH TOTALLY CHANGING HIS BODY, BUT HE DOESN’T ANYMORE. 9 P.M. MR. OWENS DOES NOT COOK. MOSTLY HE AND MS. LAMY EAT OUT — IN THE WINTER AT J.K. PLACE BECAUSE IT’S COZY AND IN THE SUMMER AT THE BRASSERIE ON THE CORNER. THEN THEY WATCH TV. LATELY THEY’VE BEEN WATCHING THE BELLA FREUD PODCAST “FASHION NEUROSIS” (MR. OWENS HAS BEEN ON MS. FREUD’S COUCH), AND BEFORE THAT THEY WERE WATCHING THE HBO SERIES “GETTING ON” WITH LAURIE METCALF. BEFORE BED, MR. OWENS WILL HAVE A FEW CIGARETTES. “I JUST DO IT IN A VERY CONTROLLED WAY, THE WAY I DRINK COFFEE, THE WAY I KIND OF DO EVERYTHING,” HE SAID. “IT’S VERY MUCH ABOUT GETTING THE CIGARETTE BUZZ BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP.” HE SMOKES ONLY MARLBORO LIGHT 100S FROM JAPAN, WHICH HE LIKES BECAUSE THE BOX IS ALL WHITE AND DOESN’T HAVE ANY WARNING LABELS. HE KEEPS A STASH IN HIS DRESSING ROOM. RECENTLY HE STARTED DRINKING AGAIN, IN MODERATION. HE HAS A SHOT OF GIN BEFORE BED. HE LIKES SEVENTY ONE, WHICH IS IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN ENORMOUS COLOGNE BOTTLE. “I WAS THINKING IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A DELICIOUS LITTLE WARM BUZZ AT THE END OF THE DAY,” HE SAID. ALSO HE THOUGHT: “IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, IT’LL TAKE ABOUT FIVE YEARS BEFORE I REALLY TANK THE COMPANY. BUT I DON’T NEED TO ESCAPE THE WAY I DID. I’M IN A DIFFERENT SPACE NOW.” 11:30 P.M. BED.

AS THE PALAIS GALLIERA PRESENTS A MAJOR RETROSPECTIVE OF HIS WORK, THE DARKEST OF AMERICAN DESIGNERS LOOKS BACK ON HIS JOURNEY. “OH, GUSTAVE MOREAU HAS ARRIVED!” RICK OWENS EXCLAIMS JOYFULLY AS HE SPOTS A SMALL PAINTING PERCHED ABOVE A PROCESSION OF SPECTACULAR LONG GOWNS. WITH HIS CAP PULLED LOW OVER LONG HAIR, A STUNNING BLACK JACKET WITH BROAD SHOULDERS, AND HIS TRADEMARK OVERSIZED SNEAKERS, OWENS WEAVES BETWEEN CRATES AND BOXES WHILE TOURING HIS RETROSPECTIVE AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA. BORN IN 1961, HE’S PRESENTING NOT ONLY HIS FAMOUSLY SCANDALOUS, DECONSTRUCTED, THEATRICAL GARMENTS, BUT ALSO THE ART, VIDEOS, AND PERFORMANCES THAT FORM A UNIVERSE WHERE BEAUTY MEETS SEX AND CONCEPT. THE OPENING ROOM, ALMOST LIKE A CHAPEL, RECOUNTS HIS EARLY DAYS IN LOS ANGELES IN THE ’80S AND ’90S: DRAWINGS, KINKY (AND CHEEKY) SKETCHES, VINYL RECORDS, AND HIS SACRED TRINITY OF “ESSENTIALS,” AS HE CALLS THEM—IGGY POP FOR “RAW ENERGY,” BOWIE FOR “GLAMOUR,” AND KLAUS NOMI FOR “SEXUAL AMBIGUITY.” THERE’S ALSO THE PRESENCE OF MICHÈLE LAMY—HIS MUSE, PARTNER, AND “DISCOVERY,” AS HE PUTS IT. AFTER WORKING IN PARIS, SHE JOINED HIM TO FOUND THE BRAND IN 1992. WARM, WELCOMING, AND ENDLESSLY CHARISMATIC, SHE’S OFTEN SEEN WITH HENNA-STAINED HANDS, A GOLD-GRILLED SMILE, AND AS BOTH A BUSINESS PARTNER AND NIGHTTIME ACCOMPLICE. AT THE HEART OF THE EXHIBIT, AMONG A HUNDRED ICONIC SILHOUETTES, TWO INTIMATE SPACES STAND OUT: ONE RECREATES THE COUPLE’S BEDROOM, AND THE OTHER SHOWCASES A “FETISHIST” ALTAR, “NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MINORS.” DESPITE ITS PROVOCATIVE EDGE, THIS “LORD OF DARKNESS,” OFTEN LABELED BY THE PRESS, OFFERS US A SURPRISINGLY GENTLE AND TENDER VISION. ELLE. HOW DID YOU APPROACH THIS EXHIBITION? IS IT A RETROSPECTIVE, A PORTRAIT? RICK OWENS. I LIKE THE IDEA OF A RETROSPECTIVE—UNLIKE MICHÈLE. BUT MICHÈLE IS STILL AN ADOLESCENT; I’M AN OLD MAN NOW [EDITOR’S NOTE: SHE’S 81 AND HE’S 63]! A RETROSPECTIVE IS A BAD OMEN. IT MEANS YOU&#39;VE REACHED YOUR PEAK—AND NOW COMES THE DECLINE. ELLE. DOESN’T THAT BOTHER YOU? R.O. NOT AT ALL. A BIG PART OF MY WORK IS ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE WHAT LIFE THROWS AT US—FEAR, SHAME, PRIDE, EGO. ALL OF THIS REFLECTS IN HOW WE DRESS, HOW WE PRESENT OURSELVES. I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE PHRASE “YOU CAN&#39;T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.” I HAVE A VERY STRONG OPINION ABOUT FASHION. ELLE. WHY THE REPLICA OF THE BEDROOM YOU SHARED WITH MICHÈLE LAMY IN L.A. IN THE LATE 1980S? R.O. THAT WAS ALEXANDRE SAMSON’S IDEA—HE CURATED THE SHOW. HE WANTED TO SPOTLIGHT OUR TIME IN L.A., WHICH IS SO PERSONAL AND INTIMATE TO THE EXHIBITION. IT’S THE FOUNDATION OF MY AESTHETIC. MICHÈLE ALWAYS SAYS I’M ONLY INTERESTED IN DEAD ARTISTS, EVEN THOUGH I’M SO DRAWN TO YOUTH AND NOVELTY. IT’S TRUE—I NEED TO KNOW HISTORY, BUT I ALSO WANT ARTISTS TO STAY FAITHFUL TO THEIR AESTHETICS THROUGHOUT. WE’VE RECREATED OUR FIRST FURNITURE PIECE TOGETHER, AND THAT’S HOW WE’VE WORKED EVER SINCE. FOR ME, IT’S FUN TO REVISIT THAT WORLD. ELLE. WHAT BOOKS SHAPED YOU? YOU’VE MENTIONED A LOVE FOR PROUST AND HUYSMANS... R.O. HUYSMANS IS FEATURED IN THE CENTRAL CASE BECAUSE HE WAS CRUCIAL FOR ME—HIS BOOKS WERE IN MY DAD’S LIBRARY. I GREW UP IN CONSERVATIVE PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA. MY DAD WAS A REACTIONARY, BIGOTED, HOMOPHOBIC VIETNAM VET, BUT HE HAD A SENSITIVE SOUL AND LOVED CLASSICAL MUSIC AND LITERATURE. I DIDN’T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND IT AT THE TIME, BUT I KNEW SOMETHING QUEER WAS HIDDEN BETWEEN THOSE COVERS. THAT’S WHAT HUYSMANS GAVE ME: A SPACE OF MY OWN, A KIND OF AESTHETIC SAFE BUBBLE. ELLE. WHAT WAS YOUR MOTHER LIKE? R.O. MY MOM WAS AMAZING. WE DIDN’T TALK MUCH ABOUT EMOTIONS, BUT WE WERE DEEPLY CONNECTED. MY DAD’S TRAUMA LEFT HIM EMOTIONALLY DISTANT, SO WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER IN SILENCE. SHE TAUGHT ME TENDERNESS. SHE WAS SO POLITE—IT WAS ONE OF HER GREATEST LESSONS. WE WERE CLOSE. WHEN SHE DIED FIVE YEARS AGO, I COULDN’T SPEAK TO ANYONE. I THINK IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO ACCEPT MY SUCCESS WHEN IT CAME FROM REJECTING THE VALUES SHE HELD. THERE WAS SO MUCH LOVE, BUT ALSO CONFLICT. SHE WOULD COME WITH ME TO FASHION SHOWS, SITTING BESIDE DRAG QUEENS. THAT WAS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. I SECRETLY BOUGHT HER A LITTLE HOUSE IN PORTERVILLE, WHERE SHE COULD NAP IN PEACE. I DECORATED IT JUST THE WAY SHE LIKED, WITH CURTAINS AND FLOWERS—EVERYTHING SHE COULDN’T HAVE WITH MY DAD. WHEN HE PASSED, WITHOUT TELLING ME, SHE MOVED INTO THAT HOUSE. IT WAS OUR SECRET. WHEN SHE GOT CANCER, I TOOK HER TO VENICE AND WE STAYED IN A BEAUTIFUL SUITE AT THE EXCELSIOR, WITH A SEA VIEW. SHE DIED TWO YEARS AGO. I STILL CAN’T LOOK AT PHOTOS OF HER. NOT YET. ELLE. WAS MEETING MICHÈLE WHAT SAVED YOU? [EDITOR’S NOTE: SHE WAS 45 AT THE TIME] R.O. YES, SHE SAVED ME. WE DRANK TOGETHER, LAUGHED EVEN MORE. SHE, MORE THAN ANYONE, IS WHY I HELD ON TO LIFE. MICHÈLE. WE KISSED A LOT! R.O. WE DID! I HAD COMPLETELY STOPPED DRINKING FOR 20 YEARS. BACK THEN, I WAS FULL OF FRUSTRATION, FEELING UNSEEN, AND MY WORK WASN’T RESONATING. THAT FRUSTRATION TURNED INTO AGGRESSION, TO PROVE SOMETHING. LOOKING BACK, MAYBE THAT WAS ARROGANCE? BUT I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO—AND DRANK THROUGH IT. THEN ONE DAY I STOPPED. A FEW YEARS AGO, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS TIME TO DRINK AGAIN. MODERATELY. BUT THE VOICE IN MY HEAD SAID: “YOU’LL JUST GET COCKY AND SCREW IT ALL UP AGAIN!” ELLE. WOULD YOU SAY YOU&#39;RE A CONTROL FREAK? R.O. PROBABLY, YES. BUT THAT DOESN’T STOP ME FROM HAVING FUN. I LIVE A VERY DIFFERENT LIFE FROM OTHER LUXURY FASHION HOUSE DESIGNERS. I ANSWER TO NO ONE. ELLE. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ASKED TO HEAD ONE OF THOSE HOUSES? R.O. A LONG TIME AGO, YES—BUT IT WOULD’VE BROUGHT MORE COMPLICATIONS THAN ANYTHING ELSE. MY WORLD IS WELL-DEFINED, AND I WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE EXPECTATIONS THAT COME WITH THAT ROLE. BUT I DO ENJOY THE FASHION CALENDAR, THE PUZZLE OF CRAFTING A CREATIVE VISION WITHIN A LIMITED TIMEFRAME AND RESOURCES. YOU JUST HAVE TO STAY ORGANIZED AND DO YOUR BEST WITH WHAT YOU’VE GOT—AND THAT IN ITSELF IS A MEANINGFUL WAY TO LIVE. ELLE. IN THE MAIN GALLERY, WE SEE KEY PIECES FROM YOUR PAST RUNWAY SHOWS. WHAT INSPIRES YOU? R.O. WHEN I FIRST STARTED, I DIDN’T DO SHOWS—I SOLD IN STORES. MARIA LUISA IN PARIS, MISS B AT BROWNS IN LONDON, JOYCE IN HONG KONG… THEN ANDRÉ LEON TALLEY DISPLAYED MY CLOTHES IN A WINDOW AT HENRY BENDEL’S, WHICH CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF ANNA WINTOUR. THAT WAS AFTER 9/11 AND THE VOGUE US WANTED TO SUPPORT EMERGING AMERICAN DESIGNERS. WITH MY FIRST SHOW, I EMBRACED THE RISK OF PUTTING MYSELF OUT THERE, EVEN THOUGH I HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY. IT WAS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME CHANCE. I HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN TO A RUNWAY SHOW! I DIDN’T KNOW HOW IT WORKED, BUT I KNEW WHAT I WANTED: SOMETHING OTHER THAN BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN HIGH HEELS WEARING HARD-TO-WEAR GOWNS. I WANTED NOT ONLY GREAT CLOTHES BUT ALSO GREAT ATTITUDES, AND TO CREATE A KIND OF CEREMONY. THAT’S HOW MY SHOWS BECAME ABOUT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES, RAW BODIES, AND USING MODELS WHO WEREN’T TRADITIONAL MODELS. SOMETIMES, YES, EVEN SHOWING THE PENIS. ELLE. WHAT WAS THE RUNWAY SHOW THAT REALLY MADE WAVES? R.O. THE IDEA WAS TO MOCK MALE POWER—THE KIND OF THING THAT WOULD’VE MADE MY FATHER FURIOUS. I WANTED TO PROVOKE THE MALE EGO, SHOWING LIMP, NON-SEXUALIZED PENISES—AS IF THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER PART OF THE MALE BODY. EVEN KARL LAGERFELD FOUND IT DISGUSTING. HE SAID, “WE SHOULD CALL HIM ‘DICK OWENS.’” I WAS SURPRISED, BUT IT MADE ME LAUGH, BECAUSE I NEVER REALLY LIKED LAGERFELD. A MAN WHO WOULD PHOTOGRAPH YOUNG NAKED MEN FROM BEHIND BUT COULDN’T BEAR TO LOOK AT A PENIS HEAD-ON? ELLE. SPEAKING OF SEX… TELL US ABOUT THE FETISH ROOM IN THE EXHIBIT. R.O. OH, YOU&#39;RE ASKING ABOUT THE PORN? ON THAT WALL, THERE ARE VIDEOS OF ME. AT THE CENTER, THERE’S A WAX STATUE OF ME PEEING LIKE A FOUNTAIN. IT’S PRETTY WILD—I FIRST SHOWED IT AT PITTI UOMO IN FLORENCE [IN 2006]. IT’S MY VERSION OF THOSE TRADITIONAL STATUES OF MEN PEEING THAT ARE HUNG OVER FIREPLACES. I’M ALSO SHOWING ONE OF THE FIRST IMAGES I EVER PUBLISHED IN THE PRESS, IN I-D MAGAZINE: A POLAROID OF ME PEEING ON MYSELF. THE CULTURE I GREW UP IN WAS DEEPLY REPRESSED—PISS WAS TABOO, A SECRET THING. BUT TODAY, IN SEX CLUBS, IT’S BECOME A RITUALIZED WAY TO RELEASE SHAME, ANGER, AND HUMILIATION IN A STYLIZED FORM. WHEN SOMEONE FINDS IT DISGUSTING, THE REFLEX IS ALWAYS: “AH YES, BUT YOUR DISGUST JUST REVEALS YOUR OWN REPRESSED HOMOSEXUALITY. YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO THAT.” ELLE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NICKNAME YOU&#39;VE BEEN GIVEN: &quot;LORD OF DARKNESS&quot;? R.O. IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I’VE ALWAYS BEEN DRAWN TO MORTALITY, COLLAPSE, REJECTION—THE DARKER PARTS OF LIFE WE TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF. WHILE MANY BRANDS GO FULL DISNEY, WITH FLOWERS, MAGIC, AND FANTASY, I’M MORE ON THE SIDE OF ITALIAN NEOREALIST CINEMA. IF I FOCUSED ONLY ON SWEETNESS, I’D FEEL FAKE. I LOVE OLD HORROR FILMS FROM THE 1920S AND 1930S—ESPECIALLY LE CHAT NOIR, A FILM FROM 1932. THE IDEA OF AN ARCHITECT LIVING IN A DUNGEON, SURROUNDED BY RELICS OF LOST LOVES… I LOVED THAT. AND OF COURSE, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW WAS A HUGE INFLUENCE. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS 15, AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT LIKE I TRULY BELONGED, LIKE THERE WAS THIS WONDERFUL TRIBE OF MISFITS OUT THERE. THAT’S THE FEELING I TRY TO RECREATE WITH THIS EXHIBIT.

LET ME EXPLAIN. WE’RE IN THE PALAIS GALLIERA, AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THE DOORS WILL BLOW OFF THE PARIS FASHION MUSEUM’S EAGERLY AWAITED RICK OWENS RETROSPECTIVE, “TEMPLE OF LOVE.” THE EXHIBITION PUTS OWENS—FASHION’S MOST CONSISTENTLY SUBVERSIVE AND FASCINATING FIGURE—IN GOOD COMPANY, AS ONLY THE THIRD LIVING FASHION DESIGNER (AFTER AZZEDINE ALAÏA AND MARTIN MARGIELA) TO RECEIVE THE HONOR. OWENS IS SHOWING ME AROUND AS A LONG LINE FORMS OUTSIDE FOR THE OPENING RECEPTION. BACK TO THE HORSE. PAST TWO MAIN GALLERIES THAT DISPLAY A COLLECTION OF OWENS’S CAREER-DEFINING LOOKS, AND A RECREATION OF THE BRUTALIST BEDROOM HE AND HIS WIFE MICHELE LAMY SHARED IN ’90S HOLLYWOOD, THERE’S A SCREENING ROOM GUARDED BY A DISCLAIMER FEATURING SOME OF OWENS’S MORE PROVOCATIVE ARTISTIC GESTURES. I SHOULD MENTION THAT OUR VIEW OF THE VIDEO—APTLY TITLED “HORSE”—IS BISECTED BY A ROPY STREAM OF WATER, WHICH IS QUITE LITERALLY PISSING OUT OF A STATUE DEPICTING A LIFE-SIZE RICK OWENS RELIEVING HIMSELF. AN OPERATIC SCORE PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND. ON SCREEN, THE SHIRTLESS DESIGNER IS DANCING ON A WHITE PLINTH AS A BLACK STALLION APPROACHES. (THE SUBSEQUENT COPULATION IS SIMULATED AND NOT AS GRAPHIC AS IT SOUNDS. YOU JUST GOTTA GO SEE IT.) OWENS IS PRACTICALLY GIGGLING. HE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO POINT OUT HOW DEEPLY FUNNY AND AWESOME IT IS THAT HIS 30-YEAR HOLY WAR AGAINST ORTHODOXY AND JUDGEMENT, HIS REFUSAL TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE FASHION WORLD’S RULES AND MORALISM, HAS LED HIM TO THIS POINT. “IT’S ALL VERY CHEAP AND LURID ATTENTION SEEKING,” HE SAYS. “BUT IT’S SO PRETTY WITH THIS MUSIC, ISN’T IT?” WITH THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL ACCOLADE IN HIS ADOPTED HOMETOWN, OWENS COULD KICK BACK, SO TO SPEAK, AND HIS LEGACY AS THE HIGH PRIEST OF HARDCORE INDEPENDENT LUXURY WOULD REMAIN SECURE. BUT OWENS IS A WALKING REFUTATION OF COMPLACENCY. TODAY HE’S WEARING HIS SIGNATURE LONG BLACK OVERCOAT WITH KNEE-HIGH LEATHER PLATFORM BOOTS, AND HIS NAILS ARE LACQUERED TO MATCH HIS RAVEN MANE OF HAIR. I’M CERTAIN THAT HE’S STILL AS CHISELED AS HE WAS TWO DECADES AGO WHEN THE PISSING STATUE WAS MADE—I’M ASSURED IT’S ANATOMICALLY CORRECT. HE’S CERTAINLY JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT DEMOLISHING TABOO AS EVER. CASE IN POINT: RATHER THAN PUT HIS FEET UP, THE 63-YEAR-OLD RECENTLY LAUNCHED AN ONLYFANS WHERE HE SELLS VIDEOS OF SAID FEET. (MORE ON THAT LATER.) THAT WHICH PERTURBS OWENS OFTEN BECOMES A LEVER THAT HIS WORK PIVOTS AGAINST. WITH ITS CONNOTATION OF FINALITY, THE WORD “RETROSPECTIVE,” OWENS SAYS, IS “THREATENING!” WHICH IS WHY, AT HIS RUNWAY SHOW THE FOLLOWING EVENING, AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO ACROSS THE STREET, OWENS WILL EMBRACE AN AURA OF MORBIDITY. THE MODELS, CLAD IN GLAM-PUNK LEATHER, WILL TRUDGE THROUGH AN ENORMOUS OUTDOOR FOUNTAIN BEFORE SCALING A PERILOUSLY HIGH SCAFFOLDING TOWER AS JETS OF WATER SPRAY TOWARD THE HEAVENS, AS IF ENACTING SOME SORT OF HEAVY METAL FUNERAL RITUAL. THE FINAL SONG IS KLAUS NOMI’S “DING-DONG! THE WITCH IS DEAD,” INDICATING IT’S TIME FOR THE GUESTS TO CROSS THE STREET FOR A PARTY AT THE GALLIERA. WITH THE RETROSPECTIVE, OWENS CONTINUES, “IT’S LIKE, IT’S PROBABLY ALL DOWNHILL FROM NOW ON. SO I’M CELEBRATING THAT AND I’M ENJOYING THE DRAMA. BUT I FEEL MORE ENERGIZED THAN EVER.” OWENS AND I BEGIN CHATTING NEAR THE FOUNTAIN, WHERE HE AND LAMY ARE WATCHING A COUPLE OF MODELS PRACTICE SCALING THE GOTH ZIGGURAT, BEFORE HEADING TO THE MUSEUM, WHERE THREE ENORMOUS STATUES DRAPED IN BLACK FLANK THE NEOCLASSICAL FACADE. GQ: I DON’T KNOW IF I’VE EVER ASKED HOW YOU COME UP WITH THESE INCREDIBLE SHOW CONCEPTS. RICK OWENS: IF I KNEW THE RECIPE TO THAT, I WOULD BOTTLE IT AND SELL IT. IT JUST COMES, AND YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST IT. AND SOME SEASONS ARE VERY SEDATE, BUT THEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SOMETHING BIG COMES OUT. I KNEW THIS ONE HAD TO BE DRAMATIC. [OWENS OBSERVES TWO MODELS SCALING THE TOWER IN WET PLATFORM HEELS. THEY’RE USING SAFETY HARNESSES, AND OWENS PURSES HIS LIPS IN DISAPPROVAL.] THEY’RE TAKING THOSE STRAPS VERY SERIOUSLY. I GUESS FOR REHEARSAL IT MAKES THEM FEEL BETTER. HOPEFULLY THEY END UP NOT USING THEM. BUT IT DOES LOOK VERY DANGEROUS. WHY DID YOU CALL THE EXHIBITION “TEMPLE OF LOVE”? BECAUSE ORIGINALLY [THE CURATOR] ALEXANDRE [SAMPSON] PROPOSED DOING SOMETHING TO THE FACADE, AND I CAME UP WITH COVERING THE EXISTING STATUES, AND WE ENDED UP CALLING THE THREE THINGS THE SISTERS OF MERCY. THAT WAS OUR WORKING NAME AND AFTER THAT, IT JUST STUCK. SO THE NAME “TEMPLE OF LOVE,” WHICH IS THIS BIG SONG BY SISTERS OF MERCY, SEEMED LIKE A GREAT IDEA. [OWENS STOPS IN FRONT OF AN EXPANSE OF FLOWERS IN FRONT OF THE MUSEUM.] OH, THIS IS GOOD. I ONLY WANTED BLUE MORNING GLORIES BECAUSE THAT WAS MY FAVORITE FLOWER IN CALIFORNIA. AND I ENDED UP PLANTING THEM ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD WHEN WE HAD THE STUDIO THERE, AND THE MORNING GLORIES JUST BURST INTO THIS HUGE, WONDERFUL CANOPY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GRITTIEST NEIGHBORHOOD. SO ANYWAY, I WANTED TO DO THEM HERE. YESTERDAY I CAME, THERE WERE RED FUCKING GERANIUMS SPOTTED AROUND. SO WE HAD THEM TAKEN OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT AGREED ON. ISN’T THAT FANCY? VERY. HOW DID YOU FIND THE PROCESS OF LOOKING BACK AT YOUR WORK TO PUT THE EXHIBITION TOGETHER? IS THAT SOMETHING YOU REGULARLY DO? I DO, BUT HAVING IT ALL IN ONE BIG LUMP IN FRONT OF YOU IS VERY DIFFERENT. AND IT IS VERY LOVELY AND VALIDATING. BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW THE IDEA OF A RETROSPECTIVE AUTOMATICALLY MAKES YOU THINK OF PEAKING AND DECLINE AND MORTALITY. AND SO I TOTALLY LEANED INTO IT [FOR THE RUNWAY SHOW]. THE MUSIC IS VERY MUCH ABOUT DEATH. AND I DID A COLLABORATION WITH THE BAND SUICIDE. IT’S VERY MOODY. AND THEN THE FINAL SONG IS “DING DONG (THE WITCH IS DEAD).” IT’S A KLAUS NOMI VERSION OF IT THAT I TECHNO-FIED. YOU ARE ONE OF THE ONLY LIVING DESIGNERS TO HAVE A RETROSPECTIVE HERE. FANCY. AS. FUCK. YOU KNOW, I’VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY, LIKE, I HATE THE WORD RETROSPECTIVE! AND YEAH, ’CAUSE IT’S THREATENING. IT’S ALL ABOUT, IT’S PROBABLY ALL DOWNHILL FROM NOW ON. SO I’M CELEBRATING THAT AND I’M ENJOYING THE DRAMA, BUT I FEEL MORE ENERGIZED THAN EVER. AND I FEEL THERE’S SO MUCH THAT I WANT TO DO TO IMPROVE. WHAT’S FUNNY IS RECREATING OUR BEDROOM FROM LOS ANGELES, IT WAS THE WEIRDEST DÉJÀ VU WALKING INTO THAT SPACE THAT WE HAVEN’T BEEN IN FOR 20 YEARS. AND THAT WAS A SPACE WHERE THERE WAS A LOT HAPPENING. THERE WERE A LOT OF DRAMAS, A LOT OF TRANSITIONS THAT, I MEAN, I WAS SUPER DRUNK IN THAT BED. I HAD NURSES GIVING ME SEDATIVES SO I DIDN’T HYPERVENTILATE TO DEATH IN THAT BED. SO I MEAN, THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WALKING INTO THAT SPACE. BUT I MEAN, OF COURSE IT FEELS DELICIOUS BECAUSE IT ALL WORKED OUT. WHY WAS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU TO ACTUALLY RECREATE THE PHYSICAL SPACE? I KNOW, IT DOES SEEM VERY SELF-INDULGENT. AND ALSO VERY INTIMATE. AND I HOPE PEOPLE SEE THAT, BUT I MEAN, IT SEEMS VERY SELF-INDULGENT. AND THEN THERE ARE PICTURES OF ME PISSING AND VIDEOS OF ME DANCING SHIRTLESS, SO THERE’S GOING TO BE A LOT OF EYE-ROLLING. BUT THERE’S A LOT OF ME IN IT, JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS CAN’T HAPPEN ANYWHERE ELSE. WHO ELSE CAN BE AS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR LABEL IN THIS DAY AND AGE? PEOPLE JUST CAN’T DO THAT. I JUST LOVE EMPHASIZING THAT BECAUSE IT’S SO UNUSUAL AND BECAUSE IT REALLY UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT IT’S A VERY PERSONAL GESTURE. IT’S NOT A COMMITTEE DECISION. AND THAT’S WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR. I’M LOOKING FOR UNCOMPROMISING PERSONAL GESTURES. SO THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO PROVIDE. THE WAY WE STARTED IS I ASKED ALEXANDRE, WHAT’S YOUR WISHLIST? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE? AND HE REALLY WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THE HOLLYWOOD YEARS AND THE BEGINNINGS. AND HE ASKED FOR THE PISSING STATUE, AND HE SAID, HOW CAN WE HAVE THE FURNITURE INVOLVED? SO I CAME UP WITH THIS IN THE BEDROOM, BECAUSE THE BEDROOM REPRESENTS THE SEED OF THE FURNITURE COLLECTION. THE BED IS THE FIRST PIECE THAT MICHELE AND I MADE FOR EACH OTHER, WITH EACH OTHER. AND THAT SPACE JUST SEEMS AS RELEVANT TO THE WAY I LIVE NOW AND TO THE KIND OF A WORLD THAT I’VE TRIED TO CREATE. IT SEEMS NOSTALGIC, BUT IT ALSO SEEMS COMPLETELY CONNECTED TO THE WAY WE STILL LIVE. WE HAVE A VERSION OF THAT BED THAT WE SLEEP IN EVERY NIGHT. DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST PIECE OF MEN’S CLOTHING THAT YOU DESIGNED? NO, BUT I REMEMBER THE FIRST SHOW. I DID A COUPLE OF CO-ED SHOWS EARLY ON, AND I DID MY FIRST MEN’S SHOW [IN 2006] AT PITTI UOMO. WHICH IS WHERE THE PISSING SCULPTURE IN THE EXHIBITION WAS FIRST SHOWN. AND THAT’S WHEN I DID THOSE FIRST “DUNKS” THAT I GOT THE CEASE AND DESIST FOR. BUT WE PRESENTED THOSE FOR A WHILE BEFORE ANYBODY ORDERED THEM. THAT WAS A LESSON IN TENACITY AND COMMITMENT. I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE NOWADAYS IDEAS AREN’T ALLOWED TO DEVELOP ENOUGH, MAYBE BECAUSE ORDINARILY IF SOMETHING DOESN’T HIT THE FIRST COUPLE OF SEASONS IT GETS RETIRED. AND THEN I BOUGHT MY HOUSE ON THOSE SHOES. IT’S A REAL LESSON ON COMMITTING TO SOMETHING AND REPEATING. AND IF IT’S A GOOD IDEA, REPEAT IT. BUT I GET IT. IT’S A TRICKY THING. IN THIS DAY AND AGE, BEING REPETITIVE IS ALMOST RADICAL. I THINK IT FEELS COURAGEOUS AND IT FEELS KIND OF HONORABLE. SO THAT’S KIND OF WHERE I’M ABOUT REPETITION. IF IT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR DONALD JUDD, IT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. WHAT DO YOU HOPE PEOPLE TAKE AWAY FROM THE EXHIBITION, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH YOUR WORK? I USED TO THINK, IF YOU KNOW WHO I AM, YOU’VE ALREADY DECIDED. BUT THERE’S A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST DISCOVERING THE AESTHETICS THAT THEY WANT TO RESPOND TO. SO THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE TO SEDUCE AND CORRUPT. BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT JUST THINK IT’S ALL SENSATIONALISM, LURID SENSATIONALISM, AND THERE IS A LOT OF THAT. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. AND I THOUGHT THAT WHEN I DID AN EXHIBITION AT THE TRIENNALE IN MILAN [IN 2017], I LOVED IT, BUT IT FELT VERY BOMBASTIC. AND I WAS THINKING, IF I EVER GET THE CHANCE TO DO THIS AGAIN, MAYBE IT WOULD BE NICE TO DO SOMETHING THAT’S QUIETER, A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CRAFTMANSHIP, A LITTLE BIT MORE NUANCED, A LITTLE BIT MORE SOFT. I DON’T KNOW IF THAT HAPPENED. I DON’T KNOW IF I DID THAT. THIS ONE SEEMED KIND OF BOMBASTIC TO ME AGAIN, BUT MAYBE I JUST CAN’T HELP IT. BUT IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL, A LOT OF IT, AND I BROUGHT IN MORE REFERENCES. I BROUGHT IN IMPORTANT PIECES FROM GUSTAV MOREAU AND STEVEN PARRINO AND JOSEPH BEUYS, JUST TO GIVE IT SOME GRAVITAS AND TO EXPRESS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF MY REVERENCE FOR HISTORICAL AESTHETICS. IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT ME SHOWING MY DICK. IT’S ABOUT MY RESPECT FOR CULTURAL REFERENCES BEFORE THAT HAVE MEANT SOMETHING TO ME, AND THAT MEANT SOMETHING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. HOW DID IT FEEL WHEN YOU WALKED THROUGH THE EXHIBITION FOR THE FIRST TIME? I MEAN, WE’VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE IMAGERY FOR TWO YEARS. IT’S LIKE A COLLECTION. BY THE TIME THE RUNWAY SHOW IS THERE, YOU’VE DRAINED ALL THE EMOTION OUT OF IT. BUT THERE IS THE THRILL OF SEEING IT ACTUALLY IN LIFE BECAUSE YOU’VE IMAGINED IT, YOU’VE PLANNED FOR IT, YOU’VE EDITED IT, YOU HAVE PLANNED ON EVERY PLAN B. BUT OF COURSE, WHEN IT HAPPENS IN FULL LIFE, IT IS THRILLING BECAUSE IT’S NOT EXACTLY HOW YOU PICTURED IT. A LOT OF TIMES, MOST OF THE TIME, IT’S BETTER. HOW DID IT FEEL WHEN YOU WALKED THROUGH THE EXHIBITION FOR THE FIRST TIME? I MEAN, WE’VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE IMAGERY FOR TWO YEARS. IT’S LIKE A COLLECTION. BY THE TIME THE RUNWAY SHOW IS THERE, YOU’VE DRAINED ALL THE EMOTION OUT OF IT. BUT THERE IS THE THRILL OF SEEING IT ACTUALLY IN LIFE BECAUSE YOU’VE IMAGINED IT, YOU’VE PLANNED FOR IT, YOU’VE EDITED IT, YOU HAVE PLANNED ON EVERY PLAN B. BUT OF COURSE, WHEN IT HAPPENS IN FULL LIFE, IT IS THRILLING BECAUSE IT’S NOT EXACTLY HOW YOU PICTURED IT. A LOT OF TIMES, MOST OF THE TIME, IT’S BETTER. IS THAT WHY YOU DESIGN THESE INCREDIBLY INTENSE SHOW PERFORMANCES, LIKE WITH THE MODELS CLIMBING THE TOWER? TO UP THE STAKES FOR YOU PERSONALLY? IF YOU’RE GOING TO DO A SHOW, DO A SHOW! I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING CHALLENGING AND BOLD. IF I’M GOING TO LEAVE MY HOUSE, I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING THAT’S KIND OF A LITTLE EXCITING. AND ALSO THAT CHANGES THE FORMAT OF A RUNWAY SHOW A LITTLE BIT, OR THAT PUSHES OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RUNWAY BOX. AND WHEN I STARTED BECOMING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MY RESOURCES, LIKE THE FABRIC AND THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE CLOTHES, I WAS ABLE TO GET MORE PLAYFUL. I WAS ABLE TO RELAX A LITTLE BIT AND START PLAYING. AND THAT’S WHAT THESE SHOWS ARE. THEY’RE PLAYING, AND I’M INVITING EVERYBODY ELSE TO PLAY TOO. IS THERE A SHOW YOU’RE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THAT CAME TO MIND AS YOU WERE LOOKING BACK? WELL, THE [SPRING 2014] STEP TEAM SHOW ALWAYS MAKES ME A LITTLE MISTY, AND THAT WAS RISKY. AND I DON’T KNOW IF I WOULD EVER DO THAT SHOW NOW. IT WOULD BE TOO PROVOCATIVE. AND EVEN THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT STILL THINK I SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE IT. AND I GET THAT. I TOTALLY GET IT. IT WAS A SENSITIVE THING TO DO. BUT WHEN I SEE IT, I AM SO PROUD AND I FIND IT SO MOVING AND SO STIRRING. THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS, BUT I LIKE A LOT OF ’EM. [OWENS AND I WALK INTO THE MUSEUM. IN THE FIRST GALLERY, TWO MANNEQUINS HANG FROM THE CEILING ABOVE LIGHT BOXES CONTAINING EPHEMERA FROM OWENS’S UPBRINGING IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA.] THAT IS AN ASTROLOGICAL CHART MY DAD MADE WHEN I WAS BORN. AND I JUST HAD IT ANALYZED AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. WHAT DID YOU LEARN? APPARENTLY I’M OBSESSED WITH SEX AND DEATH, BINGO. AND JUST A LOT OF SCORPIO STUFF. I NEVER THINK ABOUT ASTROLOGY. I NEVER TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, BUT I SEEM LIKE KIND OF A CLASSIC SCORPIO—PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE. SO THIS IS THE ROOM WITH THE DISCLAIMER. BUT THE DISCLAIMER IS REALLY GOOD. I WAS ABLE TO REDUCE IT TO THAT TEXT, AND I FEEL LIKE IT REALLY DESCRIBES WHAT I’M DOING. [UNDER A WARNING STATING THAT THE SPACE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MINORS IS A RICK OWENS QUOTE: “THE WORLD CAN BE A VERY JUDGEMENTALLY CONDEMNING AND OVERLY MORALISTIC PLACE. I FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO COUNTERBALANCE THAT WITH CHEERFUL DEPRAVITY.”] WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS PISSING SCULPTURE IN THE FIRST PLACE? FOR THAT. EXACTLY THE REASON IN THE DISCLAIMER. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH THAT PHRASE THAT JUST KIND OF CONDENSED THE WHOLE THING TO A SUCCINCT IDEA WITHOUT OVEREXPLAINING IT OR SOUNDING APOLOGETIC. WHAT I LOVE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE VIDEO THROUGH THE PISS. ISN’T THAT POETIC? BUT I ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY WAS DOING IT ON MY OWN FOR MY OWN HOUSE, BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO BE MY MASTER OF THE HOUSE PAINTING OVER THE MANTELPIECE. BUT THEN PITTI ASKED ME TO DO A PROJECT AND I THOUGHT, OH, I CAN MAKE THEM PAY FOR IT. I CAN DO THIS AND THEN IT’LL BE PART OF THAT PROJECT. [WE START WATCHING A VIDEO DEPICTING OWENS’S FEET STROKING A HUMAN SKULL. YOU CAN TELL IT’S HIS FEET BECAUSE OWENS HAS “SO” TATTOOED ON TOP OF HIS LEFT FOOT AND “CUNT” ON HIS RIGHT.] TELL ME ABOUT THIS FOOT VIDEO. THAT’S [FROM] MY ONLYFANS ACCOUNT. I OPENED AN ONLYFANS BECAUSE IT’S ALL ABOUT FOOT FETISHISM, AND I DID THAT BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE WHOLE DECLINE, THE WHOLE ADDRESSING AGING AND DECLINE. IT’S BASED ON THE CONTESSA DE CASTIGLIONE, WHO WAS A FAMOUS BEAUTY. SHE WAS THE MISTRESS OF NAPOLEON, AND WHEN PHOTOGRAPHY WAS INVENTED, SHE COMMISSIONED A LOT OF PORTRAITS OF HERSELF, AND THEY WERE ALL ABOUT HER BEAUTY AND HER. BUT THEN GRADUALLY AS HER BEAUTY FADED, SHE WITHDREW TO AN APARTMENT ON PLACE VENDÔME, CLOSED THE CURTAINS, GOT RID OF THE MIRRORS, AND SHE JUST DID PORTRAITS OF HER FEET. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SUCH AN EERIE, POIGNANT VERSION OF SOMEBODY NEGOTIATING THEIR AGING. SO THAT WAS KIND OF WHY I DID THAT ONLYFANS THING. AND YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE AND THE MONEY GOES TO ALLANAH STARR, THE GREAT TRANS PERSONALITY OF PARIS. SHE OPENED A HOME FOR AT-RISK AND IN-DANGER TRANS YOUTH AND REFUGEES. SO THAT’S WHERE THE MONEY FOR THAT GOES. WHEN DID YOU GET THE TATTOOS? WELL, I’VE BEEN DOING A “SO CUNT” ON THE SHOES AND ON SOCKS FOR YEARS AND YEARS. SO THEN A COUPLE OF SEASONS AGO I THOUGHT TATTOOS WOULD BE GOOD, AND THEY’RE REALLY GOOD FOR THE ONLY FANS. AND THEN I DYE MY HAIR IN THESE VIDEOS. I GET FUCKED BY A HORSE. THERE’S FIST FUCKING, THERE’S PISSING. IT’S ALL VERY CHEAP AND LURID ATTENTION SEEKING. BUT IT’S SO PRETTY WITH THIS MUSIC, ISN’T IT? [OWENS IS DANCING IN A VIDEO.] AND THEN THERE’S ME DANCING—WHO CAN RESIST ME JUST DANCING? WHAT’S THAT FROM? THAT’S THE HORSE VIDEO. I’M WAITING FOR THE HORSE TO SHOW UP. THERE WAS A PART WHERE THE HORSE IS DECAPITATED AND I’M HOLDING THE SEVERED HEAD, BUT I LEFT THAT PART OUT FOR THE MUSEUM. REMIND ME WHY YOU MADE THE VIDEO ORIGINALLY? THERE WAS NO REASON. ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. AND LOOK AT IT NOW, IT’S IN A MUSEUM! [A PHOTOGRAPH OF A PANTSLESS RICK OWENS MODEL FLASHES ON SCREEN.] WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW OF THE RUNWAY SHOW [FOR FALL 2015] WHERE THE MODELS HAD THEIR DICKS OUT? IT WAS SUCH A SIMPLE PHYSICAL GESTURE. AND I REALLY LIKED THAT IT WAS A SPECTACLE WITHOUT WASTE. IT WAS PITHY AND IT HAD A MORAL BASE. IT WAS ABOUT MOCKING TOXIC MASCULINITY AND PRIDE AND ARROGANCE AND PRECIOUSNESS. I KNEW THAT IT WOULD’VE MADE MY FATHER CRAZY. IT WOULD’VE MADE A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN VERY ANGRY. AND I DIDN’T EXPECT ONE OF THOSE MEN TO BE KARL LAGERFELD. HE WAS ON TV AND THEY WERE ASKING HIM, WHAT DID HE THINK? AND HE GOT VERY HUFFY ABOUT IT. HE SAID IT WAS DISGUSTING. AND THIS IS A MAN WHO’S TAKING PICTURES OF BOYS IN THE MOST COQUETTISH, HOMOEROTIC MANNER. AND I JUST GO, HERE’S A DICK. AND THAT BOTHERED HIM, AND I LOVED THAT. AND THEN SOMEBODY IN CASTING DID A CONVERSATION SOMEWHERE AND THEY SAID, IF WE’D HAVE THOUGHT MORE, WE WOULD HAVE AUDITIONED THE BOYS A LITTLE BIT BETTER, BECAUSE SOME OF THE DISPLAYS WERE NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE. AND I’M THINKING, OH MY GOD, THEY TOTALLY DIDN’T GET IT. IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAT THEY WEREN’T BIG DICKS! THEY WERE JUST NORMAL, EVERYDAY, AVERAGE DICKS. AND I LOVED IT THAT THEY WERE AVERAGE. IF I HAD ONLY AUDITIONED FOR BIG DICKS, THAT WOULD’VE BEEN EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO.

HE HAS CRAFTED A DISTINCTIVE AND ORIGINAL AESTHETIC THAT CONSISTENTLY LEADS THE INDUSTRY, CHALLENGING CONVENTIONS AND INSPIRING NEW IDEAS WITH EACH SEASONAL COLLECTION. HIS INFLUENCE EXTENDS TO BOTH DESIGNERS AND CONSUMERS. RECENTLY, HE HAS GAINED FAME FOR HIS SPECTACULAR SHOWS. YET, THESE ARE NOT MERE CLICKBAIT; THEY ARE DRIVEN BY AN INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE AND A DEEP REFLECTION THAT SHAPES HIS STYLE. A RETROSPECTIVE TITLED &#39;RICK OWENS, TEMPLE OF LOVE&#39; IS CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA IN PARIS, FRANCE, RUNNING UNTIL JANUARY 4, 2026. THE EXHIBITION TRACES HIS CAREER OF OVER 30 YEARS, FROM THE LAUNCH OF HIS BRAND IN LOS ANGELES IN THE EARLY 1990S TO THE PRESENT. IT SHOWCASES MORE THAN 100 LOOKS, FROM HIS EARLIEST DESIGNS TO HIS LATEST WORKS. THE SHOW ALSO INCLUDES EPHEMERA SUCH AS INVITATIONS, MAGAZINE CLIPPINGS, AND ALBUM COVERS BY DAVID BOWIE, KLAUS NOMI, AND IGGY POP, AS WELL AS ARTWORK AND FILM MATERIALS BY HIS PARTNER MICHÈLE LAMY AND INFLUENCES LIKE GUSTAVE MOREAU AND JOSEPH BEUYS. THIS PROVIDES A LAYERED INSIGHT INTO RICK OWENS&#39; CREATIVE UNIVERSE. ADDITIONALLY, THE MUSEUM&#39;S FIRST OUTDOOR EXHIBIT FEATURES THREE LARGE SEQUINED SCULPTURES, AND ONE ROOM DISPLAYS A LIFE-SIZED STATUE OF OWENS URINATING, FIRST REVEALED IN FLORENCE IN 2006. THE EXHIBITION HIGHLIGHTS OWENS&#39; CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSIONS, WHICH CONVEY KINDNESS RATHER THAN AGGRESSION. AFTER DEBUTING THE SPRING/SUMMER 2026 MEN&#39;S COLLECTION AND OPENING THE RETROSPECTIVE, HE EXCLUSIVELY GAVE AN INTERVIEW FOR THE SEASON TO ONE JAPANESE MEDIA OUTLET. THE SHOOT TOOK PLACE AT HIS HOME IN PARIS, AND WE EXPLORED HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE EXHIBITION, HIS BRAND, AND HIS CREATIVE INSPIRATION FROM VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES. THE TITLE OF YOUR EXHIBITION, &quot;RICK OWENS, TEMPLE OF LOVE,&quot; USES THE WORD &quot;LOVE.&quot; AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE FOR YOUR SPRING/SUMMER 2026 MENSWEAR COLLECTION, YOU WROTE THAT “LOVE IS A WORD REALLY WORTH PROMOTING RIGHT NOW.” WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT LOVE IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE ACTIVELY PROMOTING AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME? OUR WORLD IS EXPERIENCING SUCH HIGH STRESS - AND I SUSPECT MY WORLD CAN LOOK DYSTOPIAN TO SOME. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS EXPRESSING WARMTH, GOODWILL, AND HOPE. YOU&#39;VE LONG ENGAGED DEEPLY WITH THE STRUCTURAL ASPECTS OF CLOTHING—CUTTING, DRAPING, CONSTRUCTING. IN THE EXHIBITION, THERE’S FOOTAGE OF YOU WORKING DIRECTLY ON A MANNEQUIN, REFINING THE DRAPE BY HAND. IN A TIME WHEN MANY CREATIVE DIRECTORS ARE NO LONGER HANDS-ON, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO REMAIN PHYSICALLY INVOLVED IN THE MAKING PROCESS? CREATIVE DIRECTORS GIVING INSTRUCTIONS TO DESIGN TEAMS ARE JUST PAINTING WITH A BIGGER BRUSH- THIS IS A TALENT I ADMIRE. I’M JUST MORE COMFORTABLE WORKING ARTISANALLY ON MY OWN, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE BOTH COMPLETELY VALID METHODS. YOU PRESENT WORDS ASSOCIATED WITH YOURSELF OR YOUR BRAND IN ALL CAPS. WHAT DRAWS YOU TO THIS TYPOGRAPHIC CHOICE? THERE IS AN ARTIFICE TO ALL CAPS THAT MAKES EVERYTHING A CHEERFUL PROCLAMATION. AT LEAST THAT’S THE WAY I INTEND IT. AND GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CAPS AND LOWER CASE FEELS CONVENTIONALLY FUSSY TO ME. YOU&#39;VE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN AESTHETICS THAT SEEM ALMOST OPPOSITE TO YOUR OWN—LIKE ART NOUVEAU, FOR INSTANCE. WHAT IS IT THAT ATTRACTS YOU TO STYLES OR MOVEMENTS THAT DIVERGE SO SHARPLY FROM YOUR OWN VISUAL LANGUAGE? I AM SO ATTRACTED TO THE ORGANIC LANGUOR OF ART NOUVEAU BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS COMPLETELY INDULGENT COLLAPSE, WHICH IS SOMETHING I HAVE TOYED WITH IN THE PAST, BUT LEARNED I MUST AVOID IF I WANT TO SURVIVE. BUT I LOVE DREAMING ABOUT IT. YOU’VE SAID THAT NAMING A COLLECTION IS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS. WHY IS THAT? WHAT DOES A TITLE UNLOCK FOR YOU CREATIVELY? IT DOESN’T UNLOCK, RATHER, IT RESTRICTS ME AND GIVES ME BOUNDARIES. IT IS A WAY OF GIVING MYSELF AN ASSIGNMENT TO FOCUS ON A MOOD. THE DUSTY, FADED BLACKS YOU GRAVITATE TOWARD—LIKE “DUST” OR “DRKSHDW”—ARE SAID TO BE INSPIRED BY PUNK KIDS DYEING MILITARY SURPLUS GARMENTS WITH CHEAP BLACK DYE. WHAT DOES THIS APPRECIATION FOR “DAMAGED” OR DETERIORATED MATERIALS AND TONES MEAN TO YOU? THERE IS A SOFTNESS TO GREY THAT FEELS MODEST AND FORGIVING AND AMBIGUOUS AND ELEGANT. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS GREY I HAVE NAMED DUST, BUT ALSO APPRECIATE THE PUNCTUATION AND STRICT SEVERITY OF BLACK. IN THE EXHIBITION TIMELINE, THERE’S A REFERENCE TO A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATE MOSS, SHOT BY CORINNE DAY FOR VOGUE PARIS, WHICH WAS ALSO DISPLAYED. WHAT DOES KATE MOSS REPRESENT TO YOU PERSONALLY? KATE MOSS WAS A SOFT DEPARTURE FROM THE PREDOMINANT GLAMAZON AESTHETIC OF THAT TIME WHICH FELT LIKE A RESPITE FROM THE HARD FLASHY VALUES THE GLAMAZONS REPRESENTED. THERE WAS A QUIETER AND MORE POETIC FRAGILITY TO KATE MOSS THAT FELT LIKE IT WAS ADDRESSING A WIDER AUDIENCE. FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME, HER ARRIVAL WAS A VERY LIBERATING SHIFT IN CULTURAL AESTHETICS. THE FIRST ROOM OF THE EXHIBITION WAS LINED IN FELT, A CLEAR HOMAGE TO JOSEPH BEUYS. WHILE THE SPACE FELT SEALED OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD, IT ALSO SEEMED TO EMANATE A PARTICULAR KIND OF LOVE. COULD YOU SPEAK TO HOW YOU RELATE TO BEUYS’S METHODS AND HOW YOU’VE INTEGRATED THOSE INTO YOUR OWN WORK?THERE IS A SHAMANISTIC SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS TO HIS WORK THAT ALWAYS ATTRACTED ME. CONTRIVED OR NOT, JUST ADDRESSING IT IN HIS WORK, HE LINKED MORALS AND BEAUTY IN A WAY THAT ALWAYS STUCK WITH ME. HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE ADDRESSING BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR WAS SOMETHING I COULD ADD TO CELEBRATING PHYSICAL BEAUTY. AND THE RUGGED MODESTY OF HIS MATERIALS AND CONSISTENCY OF HIS VISION FELT LIKE A BEACON I COULD TRY TO FOLLOW. SINCE 2016, YOUR RUNWAYS HAVE INCREASINGLY EMBRACED SCULPTURAL FORMS OF DRESS. ONE CAPTION IN THE EXHIBITION QUOTED YOU: “YEARS AGO, I SWORE I WOULD NEVER SHOW SOMETHING ON I THE RUNWAY THAT I DIDN’T THINK WAS A PRACTICAL WAY OF DRESSING. BUT THINGS CHANGE. SHOWING GOOD-LOOKING CLOTHES ISN’T ENOUGH ANYMORE.” . WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU? WHAT MADE IT NO LONGER ENOUGH? I STILL MAKE IT A RULE TO NEVER SHOW ANYTHING WE DON’T PRODUCE FOR SALE, BUT AS THE WORLD HAS BECOME MORE STRIDENTLY JUDGEMENTAL, I HAVE REACTED BY MAKING CLOTHES THAT CHALLENGE AND MAYBE MOCK THAT CONDEMNING ATTITUDE A BIT. YOU’VE STAGED SEVERAL THEATRICAL, ALMOST RITUALISTIC SHOWS AT THE PALAIS DE TOKYO IN RECENT YEARS. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT SPACE THAT KEEPS DRAWING YOU BACK, AND WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THIS PARTICULAR PERFORMATIVE FORMAT? THIS ART DECO FORTRESS WITH BAS RELIEF BY ALFRED JANNIOT AS A BACKDROP FOR MY RUNWAY SHOWS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST JOYS OF MY LIFE. IT’S MY FAVORITE ARCHITECTURAL SPOT IN PARIS, AND TO BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO TRY TO RISE TO THE OCCASION OF PRESENTING SOMETHING THERE EACH SEASON KEEPS ME ON MY TOES. THE FINAL ROOM OF THE RETROSPECTIVE FEATURES A BED OF YOURS—A QUIET, POTENT ENDING. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO END THE EXHIBITION WITH THIS? THIS BED IS THE FIRST PIECE OF FURNITURE MICHÈLE AND I MADE FOR OURSELVES. IT’S THE SEED OF ALL THE FURNITURE THAT CAME AFTER AND REPRESENTS THE CONTINUITY I TRY TO MAINTAIN THROUGH EVERYTHING I DO. IT FEELS AS CONNECTED TO MY CURRENT LIFE AS IT DID THIRTY YEARS AGO. IT’S ALSO AN INTIMATE REMINDER OF HOW THIS IS AN EXHIBITION ABOUT A SMALL AND PERSONAL CREATIVE GESTURE, NOT A CORPORATE GIANT. IS THERE A WORK, A PERSON, OR AN EXPERIENCE THAT HAS MOVED YOU DEEPLY IN RECENT YEARS? I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING BELLA FREUD’S FASHION NEUROSIS VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE- THEY ARE THE MOST GRACIOUS AND ELEGANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD OF FASHION THAT I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. GENTLE, WARM, AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED CONVERSATIONS WITH A BEAUTIFUL CURATION OF GUESTS. BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOU CONCEPTUALIZE THE SPACE OF YOUR HOME IN PARIS, WHERE THIS SHOOT TOOK PLACE? ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR DETAILS OR ELEMENTS THAT YOU’RE ESPECIALLY FOND OF? WE JUST STRIPPED EVERYTHING AWAY AND LEFT IT AS AN INDUSTRIAL RECEIVING AREA FOR PEOPLE AND ACTIONS TO FLOW IN AN OUT. THERE IS A PIANO IN THE FRONT ROOMS THAT IS PLAYED DURING DINNERS BY CANDLELIGHT AND IN THE SUMMER WHEN THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN IT’S HEAVEN. HAVING LOOKED BACK ON YOUR JOURNEY THROUGH THIS RETROSPECTIVE, WHAT DO YOU WISH FOR IN THE NEXT PHASE OF YOUR LIFE? I JUST WANT TO TRY TO LEARN AND BUILD ON WHAT I’VE DONE SO FAR.

AN EXHIBITION AT PARIS’S PALAIS GALLIERA PAYS TRIBUTE TO THIS ICONIC, UNAPOLOGETIC FIGURE, MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER. IT’S A STRIKING PARADOX: RICK OWENS, FASHION’S PRINCE OF DARKNESS, BRIGHTENS THE DIMLY LIT HALLS OF THE PALAIS GALLIERA WITH SURPRISING CLARITY. TITLED TEMPLE OF LOVE, THE MUSEUM’S FIRST PARIS RETROSPECTIVE OF THE DESIGNER’S WORK IS TRULY ENLIGHTENING - NOT JUST IN TERMS OF LIGHTING. FEW DESIGNERS RIVAL OWENS IN RADICAL VISION OR UNWAVERING PURPOSE. HIS MONOCHROME SILHOUETTES, OFTEN MONUMENTAL AND SCULPTURAL, EVOKE GOTHIC FIGURES FROM ALTERNATE WORLDS. THE EXHIBITION FOLLOWS THIS UNIQUE AESTHETIC THROUGH REFERENCES TO GLAM ROCK, BODY ART, SYMBOLISM, FUTURISM, AND EVEN BRUTALIST SCULPTURE, REFLECTED IN OUTDOOR INSTALLATIONS INSPIRED BY HIS FURNITURE LINE. AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PORTRAIT OF HIS RADICAL DESIGN LANGUAGE. “I FEEL INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO BE TOLERATED BY THE PARISIAN FASHION WORLD, AND TO HAVE A PLACE WITHIN IT,” RICK OWENS REFLECTS. “IT’S A FORM OF RECOGNITION I DEEPLY VALUE.” SINCE ARRIVING IN PARIS IN 2003, THE AZTEC PRINCE WITH LONG HAIR AND A TRANSGRESSIVE EYE HAS WON OVER EVEN THE BOURGEOIS 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT. NOW 63, THE PATRIARCH OF THE GROTESQUE AND THE SUBLIME (REMEMBER THE INFAMOUS EXPOSED PENISES OF HIS 2015 RUNWAY) HAS BECOME A CULT FIGURE. HE’S A COUTURIER REVERED BOTH BY PEERS AND A FIERCELY DEDICATED AUDIENCE, DRAWN TO HIS UNCOMPROMISING INTEGRITY AND SINGULAR AESTHETIC LANGUAGE. “RICK OWENS IS ONE OF THE FEW TO MAKE INDIVIDUALITY A SUCCESSFUL SIGNATURE,” SAYS ALEXANDRE SAMSON, CURATOR OF THE EXHIBITION. “HIS AESTHETIC SPARKS BOTH REVERENCE AND RESISTANCE - IT’S NOT FOR EVERYONE. BUT IN AN INDUSTRY DOMINATED BY MEGA-GROUPS AND MASS LUXURY, RICK IS PROOF THAT THERE’S POWER IN DIVERGENCE.” TODAY’S RISING DESIGNERS - LIKE DURAN LANTINK, JEAN PAUL GAULTIER’S NEW CREATIVE DIRECTOR, AND TURKISH-BRITISH TALENT DILARA FINDIKOGLU - CITE HIS CREATIVE AND FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE AS A BEACON. WITHIN HIS CONSTELLATION OF HIGH-PROFILE ADMIRERS ARE MARINA ABRAMOVIĆ, A$AP ROCKY, CHAPPELL ROAN, AND MORE. THE BRAND’S STREETWEAR-INFLUENCED LINE AND COLLABORATIONS WITH MONCLER AND BIRKENSTOCK HAVE BROADENED ITS REACH BUT NEVER DILUTED ITS IDENTITY. FOR COLLECTORS LIKE FIONA LUO AND MICHAEL SMITH IN NEW YORK, WHO NOW SHARE A 200-PIECE WARDROBE, OWENS’S WORK INSPIRES BOTH DEVOTION AND PERSONAL CONNECTION. “WHAT I ADMIRE MOST,” SAYS FIONA IN A VIDEO INTERVIEW, “IS RICK’S ABILITY TO EXPRESS GENDER FLUIDITY, NOT AS A SLOGAN, BUT WITH EFFORTLESS EASE.” SINCE HIS EARLY DAYS IN THE LOS ANGELES UNDERGROUND SCENE, RICK OWENS HAS MAINTAINED AN UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO HIS AESTHETIC, AND HIS PHILOSOPHY OF LIVING. BORN IN 1961 IN PORTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, OWENS WAS RAISED IN A STRICT, RELIGIOUS HOUSEHOLD. HIS MEXICAN-BORN MOTHER, A DEVOUT CATHOLIC, LEFT A DEEP IMPRINT. HE CREDITS THE ELEGANT CASSOCKS OF HIS PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL PRIESTS AS EARLY INSPIRATION FOR HIS AUSTERE, “BIBLICAL” AESTHETIC. HIS FATHER, A SOCIAL WORKER AND AESTHETE, INTRODUCED HIM TO OPERA, JAPANESE WOODBLOCK PRINTS, AND THE DECADENT LITERATURE OF HUYSMANS. “RESPONSIBILITY MATTERED A LOT TO MY PARENTS,” OWENS REFLECTS. “I REJECTED IT AT FIRST, ONLY TO FULLY EMBRACE IT LATER. FULFILLING YOUR POTENTIAL - THAT’S THE ULTIMATE MEANING OF LIFE.” IN THE EARLY &#39;80S, HE STUDIED FASHION AT OTIS COLLEGE IN LOS ANGELES WHILE GRAVITATING TOWARD THE ALTERNATIVE SCENE ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. THERE, HE MEETS THE FRENCH ARTIST AND MODEL MICHÈLE LAMY. WITH HER EXTRAVAGANT STYLE, SHE WAS DEVELOPING HER OWN LABEL AT THE TIME. LAMY HIRED OWENS TO DESIGN HER MEN’S LINE. FROM THE START, THEIR CONNECTION WAS UNDENIABLE. WHEN OWENS LAUNCHED HIS OWN BRAND IN 1994, LAMY BECAME HIS PARTNER IN BUSINESS AND IN LIFE—MUSE, COLLABORATOR, AND GUARDIAN ANGEL. IN 2003, A CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE FRENCH FUR COMPANY REVILLON BROUGHT THE COUPLE TO PARIS, WHERE THEY MOVED INTO A STARK MODERNIST SPACE ON PLACE DU PALAIS-BOURBON THAT SERVED AS BOTH APARTMENT AND ATELIER. IT DIDN’T TAKE LONG FOR THE PARISIAN FASHION WORLD TO FALL UNDER THE SPELL OF OWENS’S ROMANTIC NIHILISM. HIS RAW ELEGANCE - TURNING DISTRESSED LEATHER, SURPLUS TENTS, AND WASHED JERSEY INTO SLINKY DRESSES AND SEVERE COATS - WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE. HIS MUTED COLOR PALETTE, INCLUDING HIS NOW FAMOUS SHADE OF GREY CALLED “DUST”, AND HIS DESTRUCTIVE TAKE ON HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR QUICKLY BECAME SIGNATURE. THOUGH THE CLASSIC SILHOUETTE OF THE 30S - TIGHT BUST, EXAGGERATED SLEEVES, MERMAID SKIRT - REMAINS, OWENS CONSTANTLY REINVENTS THE BODY’S PROPORTIONS: DRACULA COLLARS, PAGODA SHOULDERS, DONUT-LIKE VOLUMES. “HIS WORK DELVES INTO THE RADICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE BODY AND THE STRUCTURES THAT FRAME IT,” SAYS SAMSON. “INSPIRED BY CHARLES JAMES, ONE OF HIS KEY INFLUENCES, RICK IS ONE OF THE FEW DESIGNERS WHO CAN TRULY CONSTRUCT A GARMENT FROM SCRATCH.” IN RECENT YEARS, OWENS’S SILHOUETTES HAVE TAKEN ON MONUMENTAL SCALE, IMBUING THE WOMEN WHO WEAR THEM WITH STRENGTH, STATURE, AND A SENSE OF ARMOR. SOMETIMES, PERHAPS, TOO MUCH SO. “HUN (HIS NICKNAME FOR LAMY) ONCE TOLD HIM: ‘YOU MAKE WOMEN SO MAJESTIC THEY SEEM UN-FUCKABLE,’” HE LAUGHS. “IT’S ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND NOW.” IT MUST BE SAID THAT MICHÈLE LAMY&#39;S INFLUENCE ON HIM IS ABSOLUTE. WITH HER HENNA-PAINTED FACE, DIAMOND-STUDDED TEETH, AND OWENS-ONLY WARDROBE (WITH THE OCCASIONAL COMME DES GARÇONS), SHE EMBODIES THE BRAND’S INSTINCTUAL POWER. “SHE’S IMPULSIVE; HE’S METHODICAL,” SAYS SAMSON. THOUGH OWENS LEADS AN ASCETIC LIFE OF WORK AND RIGOROUS DAILY WORKOUTS, SPLITTING HIS TIME BETWEEN PARIS, LA, AND VENICE (HE RECENTLY BOUGHT AN APARTMENT OVERLOOKING LIDO BEACH), HE REMAINS DEEPLY ATTUNED TO CULTURAL CURRENTS. HIS SHOWS, OFTEN THEATRICAL AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED, EVOKE HOLLYWOOD EPICS, WITH CECIL B. DEMILLE’S SILENT FILMS AS MAJOR INFLUENCES. THEY ALSO DOUBLE AS POLITICAL STATEMENTS. TAKE THE SPRING/SUMMER 2014 SHOW: OWENS ENLISTED STEPPING DANCERS, A STRIKING FORM OF CHOREOGRAPHY DEVELOPED BY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AS A CULTURAL RITE TIED TO UNIVERSITY LIFE AND ACCESS. IN 2015, MODELS CARRIED EACH OTHER PIGGYBACK STYLE, A VISUAL METAPHOR FOR THE MIGRANT CRISIS. LAST YEAR, A QUIET, INTIMATE SHOW WAS SHAPED BY THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT. CASTING REMAINS INTEGRAL TO HIS MESSAGE. OWENS HAS FEATURED TRANS ICONS ALLANAH STARR AND DJ HANNAH ROSE DALTON OF FECAL MATTER, KNOWN FOR HER SHAVED HEAD AND WHITE-PAINTED FACE. IN AN ERA MARKED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND A BROADER RESURGENCE OF CONSERVATISM, RICK OWENS HAS EMBRACED A MISSION MORE DEFINED THAN EVER: TO CHAMPION TOLERANCE—TOWARD OTHERS AND TOWARD ONESELF. “I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD CULTURAL AESTHETICS WITHIN WHICH NOT ALL OF US FEEL REFLECTED,” HE EXPLAINS. “I DON’T REJECT OF CONDEMN ANYTHING, I JUST PROPOSE ANOTHER OPTION. MY ROLE IS TO OFFSET THEM WITH A JOYFUL PERVERSITY.” HIS TEMPLE OF LOVE AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA STANDS AS A TESTAMENT: A DARKLY RADIANT UTOPIA IN FULL RICK REGISTER—PROVOCATIVE, GENEROUS, AND WHOLLY UNEXPECTED.

VISITORS TO THE RICK OWENS RETROSPECTIVE CURRENTLY ON AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA IN PARIS EVENTUALLY ARRIVE AT A DARKENED ROOM WITH A SENSITIVITY WARNING, FOR IT SHELTERS A LIFE-SIZE STATUE OF THE DESIGNER RELIEVING HIMSELF INTO A STEEL TROUGH — AND VIDEO FOOTAGE OF FAR NAUGHTIER ACTS. AND A CONVERSATION WITH THE DESIGNER ABOUT HIS PENCHANT FOR PROVOCATION ULTIMATELY ALIGHTS ON HIS INFAMOUS “FREE WILLY” MEN’S SHOW FOR FALL 2015, WHOSE MAIN FEATURE WAS A VISIBLE PENIS, OFTEN PEEPING THROUGH PORTHOLES IN CUTAWAY OUTERWEAR. OWENS NOTES THE SPECTACLE RILED KARL LAGERFELD, WHO DENOUNCED IT AS “DISGUSTING” ON FRENCH TELEVISION. “I WAS DELIGHTED, BECAUSE THAT’S EXACTLY THE KIND OF UPTIGHT WHITE GUY I WANTED TO PROVOKE,” OWENS RECALLS. “THE WORLD IS SUCH A JUDGMENTAL PLACE, FILLED WITH JUDGMENTAL PEOPLE LIKE KARL LAGERFELD, THAT I FEEL MY ROLE IS TO PLAYFULLY TAUNT THEM AND PROMOTE MY CHEERFUL DEGENERACY TO BALANCE THINGS OUT. “I DON’T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THERE’S ANYTHING MALICIOUS IN WHAT I’M DOING,” HE STRESSES. “IT’S JUST TEASING, AND IT’S JUST KIND OF TRYING TO BALANCE OUT ALL THIS JUDGMENT.” OWENS CONFESSES THAT SOME CASTING STAFF MISCONSTRUED HIS INTENTION WITH THAT FULL MONTY SHOW, EXPRESSING SOME REMORSE THAT “SOME OF THE MEMBERS WERE NOT AS IMPRESSIVE AS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN.” “THIS WAS NOT ABOUT PORN AT ALL. THIS WAS ABOUT TREATING PENISES SO INDIFFERENTLY AND CASUALLY, TO MAKE THEM LOSE THEIR MALE SACREDNESS, AND TO TAUNT MASCULINE PRIDE.” OVER A FASHION CAREER SPANNING MORE THAN 30 YEARS, OWENS HAS REBELLED AGAINST INTOLERANCE AND UPTIGHTNESS IN ALL ITS FORMS, AND BECOME A CULT FASHION HERO FOR HIS STEADFAST INDEPENDENCE AND HIGHLY ORIGINAL FASHION VISION, SERVING UP BOMBAST AND A DASH OF TRANSGRESSION ALONGSIDE HIS DIGNIFIED, DARKLY GLAMOROUS DESIGNS. “I DO FEEL THAT THE WORLD ALWAYS NEEDS PROVOCATEURS. THE WORLD NEEDS JOHN WATERS AND DIVINE. THE WORLD NEEDS DAVID BOWIE AS ZIGGY STARDUST, WHICH AT THAT MOMENT WAS TRANSGRESSIVE AND SHOCKING AND HORRIFYING,” HE SAYS. “WHEN I SAW THOSE EXAMPLES AS A TEENAGER, IT GAVE ME THE STRENGTH TO GO ON. IT PULLED ME OUT OF SELF-LOATHING. IT PULLED ME OUT OF SHAME FOR BEING A FLAMBOYANT CHILD WHO WAS NOT IN STEP WITH CONVENTION. SO IF I CAN BE THAT FOR SOMEBODY, THAT WILL HAVE BEEN A LIFE WORTH LIVED.” BORN IN PORTERVILLE, CALIF., OWENS FIRST WENT TO ART SCHOOL, BUT THEN GRAVITATED TOWARD FASHION, SPENDING HIS FIRST YEARS AS A PATTERNMAKER. HIS COMPLICITY WITH THE KNOW-HOW BEHIND MAKING CLOTHES HAS BEEN A DEFINING FEATURE OF HIS CAREER, LEADING HIM TO ITALY, HIS BUSINESS PARTNERS, AND THE FACTORY IN CONCORDIA, ITALY, THAT TURNS OUT HIS SIGNATURE LABEL. HE CALLS HIMSELF A PURVEYOR OF SLOW FASHION, INSOFAR AS HE KEEPS HAMMERING AT THE SAME AESTHETIC NAILS, AND DESCRIBES HIS CAREER AS A SLOW BURN “DUE TO MY PARTNERS PROTECTING ME AND ALLOWING ME TO DEVELOP OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.” HIS PARTNERS ARE LUCA RUGGERI AND HIS SISTER-IN-LAW ELSA LANZO, WHOM HE INITIALLY MET THROUGH THE SALES AGENCY EO BOCCI AND ASSOCIATES, UNTIL THEY BROKE OUT ON THEIR OWN AND DEVOTED THEIR EFFORTS TO THE BUDDING CALIFORNIA TALENT. (LANZO IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND RUGGERI COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR.) THE THREE SUSSED OUT A FACTORY IN CONCORDIA, BROUGHT ON THE OWNER AS A FOURTH PARTNER, AND OWENSCORP. WAS BORN. “ONE OF THE KEYS TO OUR SUCCESS IS THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD A DESIGN ROOM IN PARIS,” THE DESIGNER EXPLAINS. “I WENT DIRECTLY TO THE FACTORY AND MADE THE SAMPLES WITH THE FACTORY THAT WAS GOING TO PRODUCE THEM… IT MADE US MORE STREAMLINED, AND IT HELPED GET STUFF INTO THE STORES IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION.” SPEAKING OVER ZOOM FROM HIS APARTMENT IN LIDO, OWENS CONFESSES TO FEELING A GREAT SENSE OF COMPLETION WITH THE PALAIS GALLIERA RETROSPECTIVE. “IT’S NOT LIKE I’M RETIRING AT ALL, BUT THERE IS A SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT, FOR SURE, AND ALSO KIND OF THINKING, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY TOP THAT?” HE SAYS. “I HAVE THIS SENSE THAT I’VE GOTTEN MORE THAN I EVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT WANTING, AND THAT KIND OF RECOGNITION FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME.” HERE, IN HIS DISARMING, EARNEST DRAWL, OWENS REFLECTS ON HIS LATEST CAREER HIGH, AND THE GRADUAL STEPS THAT LED TO HIM BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PARIS FASHION FIRMAMENT. WWD: SORRY TO DWELL ON THE QUESTION, BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TOP THE PARIS EXHIBITION? RICK OWENS: I’M NOT SOMEBODY WHO HUNGERS FOR MORE ALL THE TIME. I’M SKEPTICAL OF ALWAYS NEEDING SOMETHING BEYOND THE NEXT HORIZON. I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS SOMEBODY WHO IS PRESENT AND WHO IS FINDING GREAT SATISFACTION AND LOOKING AROUND ME AND JUST THINKING ABOUT THINGS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE, AND BEING JUST GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I’M ALWAYS SUSPICIOUS OF THE GREEDINESS OF THE FASHION WORLD, THAT VORACIOUSNESS, CONSUMPTION, CONSUMPTION, CONSUMPTION AND DISPOSING, DISPOSING AND DISPOSING. I KNOW I MAKE A LOT OF CLOTHES THAT WE SHIP AND EVERYTHING, BUT I DO FEEL LIKE I’M MAKING STUFF THAT WILL HOPEFULLY LAST FOR A LONG TIME. QUALITY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE. WWD: WHAT IS YOUR EARLIEST MEMORY OF WANTING TO BE A FASHION DESIGNER? R.O.: I WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST. I WANTED TO BE JULIAN SCHNABEL, SO I WENT TO THE OTIS ART INSTITUTE OF PARSONS SCHOOL OF DESIGN IN LOS ANGELES. I REMEMBER WE SNEERED AT THE FASHION STUDENTS FOR BEING TOO PRISSY IN OUR GRUNGY SCHOOL, BECAUSE WE PRIDED OURSELVES ON BEING REAL ARTISTS AND REAL PAINTERS. WE WERE COVERED IN PAINT, AND WE WERE GRUBBY AND GRIMY. BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS, THEY GAVE US ART THEORY CLASSES THAT WERE SO DENSE, COMPLICATED, ELABORATE AND INDULGENT. THIS IS MY PERCEPTION NOW. BACK THEN I WAS VERY INTIMIDATED BY THEM BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT, “WELL, I DON’T REALLY HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL STAMINA FOR THIS.” WWD: SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED? R.O.: I DID THE NEXT BEST THING, AS I ALWAYS LIKED FASHION AND STYLE, AND WAS GOOD WITH MY HANDS. SO I WENT TO A TRADE SCHOOL WHERE I COULD LEARN TO MAKE PATTERNS AND DID PRETTY WELL. I WAS VERY PRACTICAL, AND I THOUGHT IF I GET A SKILL, I’LL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET SOME KIND OF JOB. I MEAN, BEING A FASHION DESIGNER WAS A LITTLE TOO ABSTRACT, BUT TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO A FACTORY AND BE ABLE TO MAKE CLOTHES MADE MORE SENSE. I FOUND THAT THINKING IN 3D AND WORKING WITH PATTERNS AND SKETCHES AND SELLING ALL CAME NATURALLY TO ME. SO I WORKED AS A PATTERNMAKER FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS, JUST WORKING IN FACTORIES, AND IT GAVE ME AN INCOME. AND THEN AT SOME POINT I THOUGHT, “OK, I’VE BEEN COMFORTABLE FOR A WHILE. NOW I JUST NEED TO GO ALL PUNK ROCK, NOT WORRY ABOUT MONEY.” I THOUGHT, “MAYBE IT’S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOREVER, BUT THAT’S OK, BECAUSE NOW I’M GOING TO BE WHO I NEED TO BE, AND IT NEEDS TO BE FULL-ON. IT NEEDS TO BE HARDCORE”…. I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF CHARLES JAMES, WHO HAD ALMOST A MYSTICAL REVERENCE FOR STICKING TO HIS EXQUISITENESS, FOR STICKING TO HIS GUNS, AND DOING THINGS HIS WAY, AND LIVING IN KIND OF A SQUALOR, BUT KIND OF A GLAMOROUS SQUALOR, ALMOST A MONASTIC, ELEVATED SQUALOR. THAT WAS MY BIG AMBITION. WWD: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WAS YOUR BIGGEST BREAK AS A FASHION DESIGNER IN THE EARLY DAYS? R.O.: I ALWAYS CREDIT (RETAILER) CHARLES GALLAY. TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH THAT DISCRIMINATING EYE ENDORSE ME WAS SUPER ENCOURAGING. I BROUGHT HIM SOME CLOTHES, AND HE AGREED TO BUY THE LITTLE COLLECTION THAT I HAD, PAYING 50 PERCENT DOWN AND THEN THE REST ON COD, WHICH IS HOW I SURVIVED FOR A WHILE. AT THE TIME HE HAD THREE STORES. AT SOME POINT HE SAID, “YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD SHOW YOUR STUFF IN PARIS. AND IF YOU GO, I’LL INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME PEOPLE.” AND THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED…. I STARTED SELLING TO HENRI BENDEL, CHARIVARI, JOYCE IN HONG KONG. THERE WAS THIS NETWORK OF FASHION PIONEERS, SO THAT ENABLED ME TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH MRS. (JOAN) BURSTEIN AT BROWNS. WWD: HOW DID YOU END UP LEAVING AMERICA AND RELOCATING TO EUROPE? R.O.: I WAS ALREADY SPENDING SO MUCH TIME IN EUROPE BECAUSE MANUFACTURE, LEARNING HOW TO MANUFACTURE IN ITALY, IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, WAITING FOR SAMPLES IN LOS ANGELES, GOING FOR A WEEK IN ITALY, THERE WAS SO MUCH FOR ME TO LEARN ON HOW TO TRANSLATE WHAT I WAS DOING INTO AN INDUSTRIAL, ITALIAN, INDUSTRIAL METHODS. SO I ENDED UP STAYING AT THE ITALIAN FACTORY A LOT AND AND IT JUST AT ONE POINT, I JUST DIDN’T GO BACK. WWD: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU, ELSA AND LUCA ARE THREE MUSKETEERS. R.O.: ELSA AND LUCA WERE THERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, AND THEIR AMBITION MATCHED MINE. THEY NEEDED TO MAKE THIS WORK. THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR THIS TO BE A SUCCESS AS MUCH AS I WAS. THEY HAD PUT ALL THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET — MINE. SO ALL OF US WERE JUST YOUNG AND HUNGRY AND HAD THE ENERGY TO BE FEROCIOUS. IT’S ALSO KIND OF A LOVE STORY, BECAUSE THIS DOESN’T HAPPEN A LOT WHERE THE CEO AND THE DISTRIBUTORSHIP AND THE PRODUCTION HAVE ALL STAYED TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME. IT’S A VERY GOOD, LUCKY MARRIAGE — AND THEY ARE MORE, THEY ARE PROBABLY MORE TALENTED THAN I AM, FINDING WAYS TO GET THE STUFF SOLD AND PROTECTING ME. IF I HAD WORKED FOR OTHER HOUSES, I WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED A LONG TIME AGO. I WOULD HAVE HAD MY THREE YEARS TO PROVE MYSELF AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IT AND THROWN AWAY. I WAS PROTECTED (BY ELSA AND LUCA) AND I WAS ALLOWED TO DEVELOP MY VOICE OVER LONGER THAN THREE YEARS. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE MOMENTS PROBABLY WHERE THERE WASN’T THAT MUCH TO SELL, BUT THEY FIGURED IT OUT, AND THEY STUCK WITH ME. WE DON’T SEE THAT KIND OF LOYALTY MUCH THESE DAYS. WWD: DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR CAREER HAS BEEN A SLOW BURN? R.O.: YES, DUE TO MY PARTNERS PROTECTING ME AND ALLOWING ME TO DEVELOP OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THERE WAS A MINUTE WHERE AMERICAN VOGUE OFFERED TO SPONSOR MY FIRST ACTUAL RUNWAY SHOW… I HAD SOME TREPIDATIONS, BECAUSE I WAS VERY AWARE THAT MY AESTHETIC WAS NOT GOING TO BE AS EXCITING AS OTHERS UNDER THE GLARE OF A RUNWAY SPOTLIGHT. THE WHOLE ALLURE OF FASHION SHOWS WAS SOMETHING I WASN’T FAMILIAR WITH, HOW TO CREATE THAT MAGIC. BUT I KNEW IT’S A LIFELONG COMMITMENT. YOU CAN NEVER, EVER STOP, BECAUSE ONCE YOU STOP, PEOPLE ASSUME THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG AND IT STAINS YOUR ALLURE. THERE WERE SOME BUMPY MOMENTS WHERE I FEEL LIKE I WAS AWKWARD ON THE RUNWAY, BUT JUST KEPT WORKING AND LEARNING. AND AFTER A WHILE, I FELT LIKE I KIND OF KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, AND THEN I STARTED PLAYING. I STARTED GETTING MORE DRAMATIC. WWD: INDEED, YOU BLOSSOMED INTO ONE OF THE GREAT SHOWMEN OF PARIS. WHAT WAS THE SPARK? R.O.: I THOUGHT, “HOW CAN I SHOW BEAUTY AND MORALITY? HOW CAN I SHOW BEAUTY AND BEHAVIOR?” INSTEAD OF PUTTING WOMEN IN PRECARIOUS POSITIONS AND TREATING THEM LIKE DOLLS, HOW CAN I ADDRESS HUMAN CONDITIONS AND A BEAUTY THAT ISN’T ABOUT LIPSTICK, AND MORE ABOUT BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR? THAT MADE ME BLOSSOM, AND I STARTED DOING THINGS THAT WERE MORE RISKY AND MORE EXTREME. THE FOG MACHINES GOT BIGGER THEN, AS LONG AS WE’RE DOING FOG, LET’S TRY FIRE. LET’S TRY HANGING PEOPLE UPSIDE DOWN. LET’S GO ALL THE WAY. LET’S GO HARDCORE. I HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS IN ME. WWD: HAVE YOU EVER CONTEMPLATED SELLING YOUR HOUSE, OR HELD TALKS TO SELL A STAKE? R.O.: SURE, I’VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I’VE HAD OFFERS AND I’VE THOUGHT IF I WERE RESPONSIBLE AND WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF MY LOVED ONES, THIS WOULD BE THE WAY TO DO IT. THIS BUSINESS IS TRICKY, AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT THEN I ALSO THOUGHT, “WELL, EVERYBODY WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO SURVIVE WITHOUT ME…” BUT I REALLY DON’T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITH MYSELF AFTERWARDS. I WOULD BE LOST NOT HAVING THIS SENSE OF PURPOSE, THIS CALENDAR, THIS SENSE OF URGENCY AND THIS CYCLE OF THE RUNWAYS, COLLECTION AND SEASONS, I LOVE IT. I LOVE THAT PACE. WWD: WHAT’S THE BEST THING ABOUT BEING INDEPENDENT, AND THE MOST CHALLENGING? R.O.: WELL, BEING ABLE TO TAKE A NAP EVERY DAY IS A LUXURY THAT REALLY NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE CAN AFFORD. I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE DISADVANTAGES ARE. THERE IS STRESS, BUT EVERYBODY’S LEVEL OF STRESS RISES TO THEIR PERSONAL WORLD. THIS LAST SHOW LEADING UP TO THE RETROSPECTIVE, AND ALL OF IT HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE TINY BIT MORE STRESSFUL THAN I’M USED TO. I’M NOT SOMEBODY WHO’S GOING TO COLLECT CARS, COLLECT ART OR GET A YACHT OR A PRIVATE JET. THAT’S NOT MY THING AT ALL. THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE IS LEARNING THINGS SO I THOUGHT, I’M GONNA LEARN FRENCH, IT WILL BE GREAT. WWD: HOW IS THAT WORKING OUT? R.O.: OSTENSIBLY, THE REASON FOR IT WOULD BE SO THAT I COULD SPEAK FRENCH FOR THE (EXHIBITION) AUDIO GUIDE, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE POLITE AND GRACIOUS THING TO DO. PARIS IS OFFERING YOU THIS RETROSPECTIVE, THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS SPEAK A LITTLE FRENCH SOMEWHERE. I’M STILL FLABBERGASTED AT HOW LITTLE I HAVE LEARNED IN ALL THIS TIME, HOW LITTLE I HAVE ABSORBED. IT’S A LITTLE HUMILIATING, AND HUMBLING, WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT THE WORST THING. AS OF NOW, I AM STILL TAKING FRENCH AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE READING A BIOGRAPHY OF JACQUES DOUCET, WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FASCINATION FOR ME. HE OWNED ALL OF THIS EILEEN GRAY FURNITURE, SOME BRANCUSIS AND PICASSO’S “LES DEMOISELLES D’AVIGNON.” HE HAD THIS COLLECTION WHEN IT WAS ALL NEW. IT’S NOT LIKE THIS STUFF HAD PROVENANCE OR MYTHOLOGY BEHIND IT. HE HAD THIS DISCERNING EYE AND ASSEMBLED THIS GROUP OF THINGS THAT BECAME SO IMPORTANT LATER ON AND SO IMPORTANT FOR ME PERSONALLY. THESE ARE THINGS THAT I PERSONALLY HAVE ALWAYS LOVED. WWD: DO YOU HAVE ANY ROLE MODELS OR MENTORS THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE WAY YOU’VE DESIGNED YOUR BUSINESS AND YOUR CAREER? R.O.: I DON’T KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE BUILD BUSINESSES. I WORKED WITH PARTNERS WHO ARE TALENTED AT DISTRIBUTION, AT MANAGING PEOPLE AND PUTTING A TEAM TOGETHER. ESTHETICALLY, THERE’S CHARLES JAMES, THERE’S MARIANO FORTUNY, THERE’S MADAME GRES, AND THERE’S ZORAN. DO YOU REMEMBER ZORAN? HENRI BENDEL HAD A RICK OWENS AREA, AND THEY ALSO HAD A ZORAN FLOOR, AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PEAK OF AVANT-GARDE IN THOSE DAYS. I WAS JUST SO PROUD TO BE IN THE SAME STORE THAT SOLD ZORAN. WWD: DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC AMBITIONS IN MIND FOR YOUR HOUSE? R.O.: I CAN ALWAYS GET BETTER. I THAT’S ALL I WANT TO DO. I JUST WANT TO GET BETTER, AND I’M GOING TO KEEP GOING. I’M NOT COMPARING MYSELF TO MARLENE DIETRICH AT ALL, BUT I’M LOOKING AT HER STORYLINE. I’VE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH HER WHOLE TRAJECTORY. SHE EMERGES AS VERY PROVOCATIVE AND TRANSGRESSIVE, AND SHE CHAMPIONS AN ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE WITH HER SEXUALITY. AND SHE FOLLOWS THAT FOR A WHILE, BUT THEN THE WAR ARRIVES, AND SHE DEVOTES HERSELF TO MORALITY BY ENTERTAINING THE TROOPS. VERY IMPRESSIVE. AND THEN AFTER THAT, SHE REDUCES HER LIFE TO A CABARET ACT THAT IS SO RESTRAINED AND SO MINIMAL AND SO FOCUSED, BECAUSE SHE’S NOT A GREAT SINGER. BUT THE WAY THAT SHE’S ABLE TO TAKE WHAT SHE’S GOT, HER ALLURE, HER DISCIPLINE, HER RIGOR, HER PACING, HER INTONATION, HER THEATRICALITY, AND FOCUS IT INTO SOMETHING MAGIC THAT IS FANTASTIC, THE WAY THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS. I’M THINKING, “AM I ENTERING MY CABARET MOMENT?” I DIDN’T COMMIT MYSELF TO MORAL DUTY A SLIVER AS MUCH AS SHE DID, BUT I, I WAS AWARE OF WHAT I WAS CONTRIBUTING MORALLY TO THE WORLD. I DID TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. I DID TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. YOU CAN’T STAY THE SAME FOREVER, AND YOU HAVE TO — DARE I SAY IT? — AGE GRACEFULLY. THIS IS ANOTHER PERIOD AND HOW DO I, HOW DO I DO THAT IN A GRACEFUL, CONVINCING AND AUTHENTIC WAY? SO STAY TUNED. WWD: SPEAKING OF MORALITY, DURING THE PANDEMIC, YOU WERE PROBABLY THE ONLY DESIGNER WHO SHOWED MODELS IN FACE MASKS. HOW COME? R.O.: WE RETREATED TO THE LIDO BECAUSE IT WAS A TWO-HOUR CAR RIDE FROM OUR FACTORY, AND WE HAD THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO RUNWAY SHOWS, WITH NO AUDIENCE, WITH OUR SKELETON TEAM FROM CONCORDIA. WE ARE IN A PERIOD THAT WAS VERY THREATENING, AND WE DIDN’T KNOW WHERE IT WOULD END. BUT HOW YOU HANDLE ADVERSITY DEFINES SOMEBODY’S CHARACTER, HOW ONE RISES TO THE OCCASION AND DOES THEIR VERY BEST IN THAT SITUATION. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR. HOW COULD YOU NOT SHOW FACE MASKS DURING THIS MOMENT? AND THOSE WERE SOME OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS. IT WAS VERY BONDING FOR US ALL. WWD: ANY OTHER PROUD ACHIEVEMENTS? R.O.: I’M HERE ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THIS APARTMENT OVERLOOKING THE SEA, WITH VENICE A FIVE-MINUTE BOAT RIDE AWAY — AND I DON’T KNOW HOW I GOT HERE. I’M HAVING SUCH A QUIET SELF-CARE PERIOD AND I FEEL THIS TRANQUILITY WITH THAT RETROSPECTIVE, IT REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE A DIFFERENT ERA. IT REALLY FEELS LIKE SUCH A RESOLUTION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I AM WORKING ON WOMEN’S RUNWAY, AND BELIEVE ME, I HAVE AS MUCH FIRE IN MY BELLY TO DO GOOD THINGS, IF NOT MORE. I FEEL THE SAME AMBITIOUS URGE TO JUST DO THE BEST STUFF THAT I CAN, AND TO GET BETTER AND TO TRY AND GET SOMEPLACE MAGIC.

CLAUDIA CROFT HEADS FOR KNIGHTSBRIDGE AFTER HOURS TO CATCH UP WITH THE GROUNDBREAKING DESIGNER. NIGHT FALLS OVER LONDON AND BRINGS A HUSH TO THE HALLOWED HALLS OF HARRODS. THE STORE IS CLOSED, BUT CLEARLY NOBODY HAS TOLD RICK OWENS, FASHION’S ‘LORD OF DARKNESS’, WHO ALONG WITH HIS WIFE, CREATIVE MICHÈLE LAMY, IS RUNNING RIOT THROUGH THE EMPTY STORE. THE PAIR ARE DRESSED HEAD-TO-PLATFORM-HEEL IN OWENS’ DESIGNS. A SHARP-SHOULDERED COAT AND SIGNATURE PERSPEX-HEELED KISS BOOTS FOR HIM; A SCULPTURAL JACKET AND LEGGINGS WITH PADDED FLARED BOOTS FOR HER, ARMS FULL OF BANGLES, OFFSET BY GOLD AND DIAMOND MOUTH JEWELLERY. “IT’S NICE AND EERIE AND SPOOKY,” SAYS OWENS APPROVINGLY OF THEIR AFTER-HOURS ADVENTURE, WHICH TAKES THEM ALL OVER THE STORE, FROM THE HELIDECK DOWN TO THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE TUNNEL (AT POINTS, DEEPER THAN THE PICCADILLY LINE) VIA THE WORLD-FAMOUS WOMENSWEAR FASHION FLOOR, HEAVING WITH THE LATEST DESIGNER LOOKS. “IT’S A TIDAL WAVE OF BEAUTY,” SAYS THE DESIGNER. “I’M JUST LOOKING AROUND THINKING, ‘GOD, WITH ALL OF THIS STUFF TO BUY, HOW WOULD PEOPLE EVER GET AROUND TO CHOOSING US?’” BUT CHOOSE HIM THEY DO. THE DESIGNER HAS ALWAYS OFFERED SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE MAINSTREAM. “I HOPED TO GIVE EVERYONE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD AESTHETICS AND BEAUTY THAT WE SEE,” HE SAYS OF HIS SIGNATURE STYLE, WHICH STRETCHES FROM GOTHIC MINIMALISM TO HEROIC ALIEN GLAM-ROCK SWAGGER. HE DESCRIBES THE BLACK CONTACT LENSES THAT HIS MODELS WORE ON HIS AUTUMN/WINTER 2025 RUNWAY (INSPIRED BY MANGA CARTOON EYES) AS “MY RED LIPSTICK”; MEANWHILE, HIS BOLD SHOULDERS, SINUOUS DRAPES AND DRAMATIC SILHOUETTES EXUDE HIGH-PRIESTESS CHARISMA. EVEN HIS SIMPLE T-SHIRTS HAVE A SLINKY SENSUALITY. “I DON’T MIND IT,” HE SAYS OF HIS ‘DARK FASHION’ REPUTATION. “WHAT I DO AESTHETICALLY IS A LITTLE DARK, BECAUSE I’M TRYING TO PRESENT A CREATIVE GESTURE THAT ENCOMPASSES A WHOLE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. NOT ALL OF THAT IS CELEBRATORY. LIFE IS FULL OF GLORY AND HORROR. I FEEL LIKE WHAT I DO IS MORE AKIN TO ITALIAN REALIST MOVIES FROM THE ’40S THAN IT IS TO A DISNEY FANTASY.” FOR AW25, HE EXPLORED THE IDEA OF THE ‘ESSENTIAL’ RICK OWENS LOOK, FOCUSING ON FINESSING HIS SIGNATURE CUTS AND ELONGATED SILHOUETTES. HIGH-COLLARED FLOOR-SWEEPING COATS, SPLIT-HEM MAXISKIRTS EMBELLISHED WITH LEATHER PETALS, PAGODA SHOULDER KNITS AND LUXURIOUS SHEARLING STOLES WERE WORN BY MODELS STRIDING OUT IN STRIKING LEATHER-WRAPPED PLATFORM BOOTS. AND FOOTWEAR (TOWERING PLATFORMS, INFLATABLE BOOTS, STRIKING THIGH-HIGHS…) PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE RICK OWENS UNIVERSE: “SHOES DICTATE HOW YOU NAVIGATE THE DAY. HEELS JUST MAKE YOU WALK A DIFFERENT WAY, ENTER A ROOM WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE.” DESPITE THE FIERCENESS OF HIS LOOK, OWENS’ APPROACH IS ROOTED IN OPENNESS, EMPATHY AND A DESIRE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE, KINDER POINT OF VIEW COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL ANTAGONISTIC BINARIES. DRESSING UP, HE SAYS, IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. “CLOTHES HAVE BEEN ABOUT COMMUNICATION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME,” HE SAYS, RECALLING HOW, AS A YOUTH, HE WOULD EXPRESS HIS DISSATISFACTION WITH THE WORLD BY WEARING TORN AND DESTROYED CLOTHES. “BUT IT WAS ONLY NEGATIVE. AS I GREW OLDER, I THOUGHT, I CAN EXPRESS MY DISCOMFORT WITH THE STATUS QUO BY CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING ELSE. THAT IS A MORE POSITIVE ACTION.” NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE GOES TO THE AIRPORT, HE MAKES SURE HE’S TAILORED TO PERFECTION: “I WEAR A COAT WITH A VERY PRECISE SHOULDER. I WEAR PLATFORM BOOTS. I’M TELEGRAPHING THAT I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE AND FORMAL. FORMALITY IMPLIES POLITENESS, AND POLITENESS IMPLIES BEING KIND. SO THAT’S MY LITTLE EFFORT.” THAT THOUGHTFULNESS IS WOVEN INTO EVERY PIECE HE MAKES. EVEN HIS MOST UTILITARIAN IDEAS COME WITH A TWIST OF PERSONAL LUXURY. THINK THE AW25 HOODIE, MADE FROM RIBBONS OF RUBBER ARRANGED ON THE BIAS THAT PULSE LIKE GILLS WITH EVERY STEP. OR HOW ABOUT THE APPARENT SIMPLICITY OF A MINIMALIST BOMBER JACKET, LINED WITH THE SOFTEST GLOVE LEATHER? “IT’S ALMOST MYSTICAL, ISN’T IT?” SAYS OWENS, OF THE APPEAL OF LEATHER AGAINST BARE SKIN. HE PLANS TO WEAR HIS LEATHER-LINED AW25 BOMBER ALL SEASON – “IT JUST FEELS SO DELICIOUS WHEN YOU SLIDE INTO IT. IT WAS SUCH A SIMPLE IDEA, BUT IT’S SUCH AN OPULENT THING TO DO FOR YOURSELF. IT’S THE MOST SIMPLE EXTRAVAGANCE THAT ANYBODY CAN RELATE TO.” THAT PIECE GOES TO THE HEART OF OWENS’ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: “MAKE THE SIMPLEST, MOST ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS AROUND YOU AS SUPERNATURAL AS POSSIBLE,” HE SAYS – AN APPROACH THAT EXTENDS TO HOW HE LIVES. “I HAVE A CUSTOM-MADE CARVED MARBLE TOILET BECAUSE I BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO YOU SHOULD BE AS SOPHISTICATED OR AS MAGICAL AS POSSIBLE.” OWENS’ HOMES IN PARIS, VENICE AND CONCORDIA (THE SMALL ITALIAN TOWN WHERE HIS FACTORY IS BASED) ARE AUSTERE, FILLED WITH JUST A FEW BELOVED OBJECTS, INCLUDING A VIENNESE SECESSION SCULPTURE BY GEORGE MINNE AND AN EGYPTIAN SARCOPHAGUS – WHICH TRAVEL WITH HIM FROM HOME TO HOME – A SET OF ELIEL SAARINEN CHAIRS AND A HUMAN SKULL. BUT THEN, HE’S ALWAYS DONE THINGS HIS OWN WAY. BORN IN THE SMALL CALIFORNIA TOWN OF PORTERVILLE, HE DIDN’T GO TO FASHION SCHOOL OR INTERN WITH ESTABLISHED DESIGNERS; HIS FIRST STEPS CAME AS PATTERN CUTTER. HE LAUNCHED HIS OWN LINE IN 1994, AND WITH KATE MOSS AN EARLY ADOPTER OF HIS AESTHETIC – SPECIFICALLY THROUGH HIS LEATHER JACKETS – THE MOMENTUM BEGAN TO BUILD. AFTER INITIALLY SHOWING AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK (SS02 COLLECTIONS), HE WAS SOON ON THE MOVE AGAIN – TO PARIS IN 2003, WHERE HE ESTABLISHED OWENSCORP (WITH HIS WIFE) THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND HIS OPERATIC TAKE ON CATWALK DRAMA HAS BEEN A HIGHLIGHT OF THE FASHION-SHOW LANDSCAPE EVER SINCE. OWENS HAS HAD THE SAME ITALIAN BUSINESS PARTNERS, ELSA LANZO AND LUCA RUGGERI, FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY, BUT THE DESIGNER RETAINS CREATIVE AND FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE. THAT’S A DYNAMIC HE’S HUGELY GRATEFUL FOR – AND WHICH HAS CLEARLY BEEN CRUCIAL. “IT ALLOWED ME TO DEVELOP,” HE REFLECTS SIMPLY. “IF I HAD JOINED A BIG HOUSE – NOT THAT ANYONE’S ASKING ME – BUT IF I HAD JOINED A BIG HOUSE, MY CAREER MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVER A LONG TIME AGO.” MUSING ON THE KIND OF CREATOR HE ASPIRES TO BE, HE SAYS, “I WANT TO BE SOMEBODY WHO IS CONSISTENT FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END.” IT’S FAIR TO SAY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR: HE’S CURRENTLY BEING HONOURED WITH A HUGE RETROSPECTIVE EXHIBITION AT THE PALAIS GALLIERA IN PARIS (RUNNING UNTIL EARLY JANUARY 2026), WHICH CHARTS HIS REMARKABLE JOURNEY AND THE STEADFAST CONSISTENCY OF HIS LOOK. A POWERHOUSE OF DEFIANT MINIMALIST GOTHIC GLAMOUR, OWENS WALKS HIS OWN PATH; HE DOESN’T FOLLOW TRENDS, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO EXPAND UPON HIS SINGULAR AESTHETIC EACH SEASON. HE’S IN FASHION… BUT ALSO BEYOND IT. TIMELESS.

WHO WILL BE THE NEXT BIG NAMES?&nbsp; I&#39;M A BIG FASHION FAN AND WOULD NEVER LIST FAVORITES, BUT I DON&#39;T THINK I WOULD COME UP WITH ANY NAMES THAT WOULD SURPRISE ANYONE.&nbsp; THE SUCCESS OF SHOPS LIKE H&amp;M, ESHOPPING, ETHICAL AND GREEN FASHION, FASHION FOR KIDS, FAST AND SLOW FASHION...WHICH OF THESE NEWS TRENDS HAVE CHANGED THE BUSINESS LANDSCAPE, AND WHICH ONES WILL LAST?&nbsp; I CAN&#39;T TAKE GREEN FASHION VERY SERIOUSLY. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP, BUY FEWER CLOTHES. E-SHOPPING IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT&#39;S ON MY MIND A LOT NOW. I WOULD NEVER SEE PROGRESS AS A THREAT, BUT I HONESTLY CAN&#39;T FIGURE OUT THE FAIREST WAY FOR THIS TO WORK YET.&nbsp; IN YOUR OPINION, WHICH FASHION TREND MARKED THE YEARS SINCE THE MILLENNIUM?&nbsp; I THINK THAT AS A REACTION TO INFORMATION OVERSATURATION, A DESIRE TO EDIT MORE CAREFULLY HAS DEVELOPED.&nbsp; BLOGS, TEENAGERS AS TASTEMAKERS...FASHION HAS CHANGED. IS IT A TRANSIENT PHENOMENON OR ARE THEY THE NEXT TRENDSETTERS?&nbsp; FASHION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SELECTIVE PROCESS; THE AUDIENCE JUST GOT BIGGER, THAT&#39;S ALL.
